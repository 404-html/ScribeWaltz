<v Speaker 1>These headphones make a difference.</v>

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280

<v Speaker 1>eyeball and they go,</v>

10
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>don't look at it.</v>

13
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right in my eyeball.</v>

14
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

15
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Which one are you ready to head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they come in like this looks,</v>

16
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but then it's like right as it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into your eyes,</v>

17
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>slightly to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it goes to like the outside of the,</v>

18
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>the black part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

19
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>How do they keep your eyeballs opened</v>
<v Speaker 1>from blinking?</v>

20
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Style.</v>

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Like a speculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but what's that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clockwork.</v>

24
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that to,</v>

25
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hitting you with drops to like</v>

26
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>wet it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

27
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>That they peel back the layer like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grape,</v>

28
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the show up rate.</v>

29
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>How does that feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

30
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really feel it whoa.</v>

31
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like,</v>

32
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like a slight scar that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heal.</v>

33
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>But you're not used to having a scar</v>
<v Speaker 1>between your eyelid in your eyeball.</v>

34
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>So it feels like a piece of sand is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they're like,</v>

35
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>do not rub it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sand in there.</v>

36
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Just don't rub it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I balls or some fucking serious shit.</v>

37
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most disturbing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me about mma is I pokes when guys</v>

38
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I poked almost I'd to,</v>

39
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather see a guy get hit real hard.</v>

40
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get I poked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the worst thing of on a game of</v>

41
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

42
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>dude crushed him with two I boiler</v>
<v Speaker 1>alert,</v>

43
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever spoiler stuff that's five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

44
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I knew show was like three</v>
<v Speaker 1>or four years old dude who got smushed.</v>

45
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>It was bad ass ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to win so bad.</v>

46
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>He had so much going for him so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going to get revenge.</v>

47
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Finally he had flare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had technique.</v>

48
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>He was a bisexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>but they all were back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

50
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>People just fucked everybody back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's like,</v>

51
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>there's so much of a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think about like what the Romans</v>

52
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>did and what all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures did,</v>

53
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>they were like fucking each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking young boys like young boys.</v>

54
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It was normal for guys to fuck young</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

55
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better World.</v>

56
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:30.534
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking strange when you go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you listen to like,</v>

58
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it was plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Plato was one of the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big boy fuckers wasn't he fucker.</v>

60
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I think polito was a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uh,</v>

61
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>he was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

62
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>a warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like accomplished warrior then</v>

63
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>If I'm remembering this story correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're pretty fucking high,</v>

65
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is probably wrong high right now</v>

66
00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>and it's awakened big day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this pet or have you heard that</v>

67
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>term?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

68
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>when I googled him and boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what comes up.</v>

69
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>So what does a better us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means someone who likes to fuck young</v>

70
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.194
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

71
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre that that was like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>commonplace amongst very respected</v>

72
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals at one point in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history played or didn't lose his</v>

73
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:24.571
<v Speaker 1>fucking subway campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go on big philosophers in</v>

74
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.091
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't take it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're dead and it's a long time</v>

76
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.330
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we set,</v>

77
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we should,</v>

78
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he had a lot to contribute.</v>

79
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>We should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should accept aberrant behavior,</v>

80
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>but we should also maybe look at it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign of,</v>

81
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's massive advancement and</v>

82
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:51.061
<v Speaker 1>understanding about human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the consequences of sexual abuse,</v>

83
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>like all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think they really had</v>

84
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>enough time to live to figure things out</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

85
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's was dead at 30 right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to fuck them up as adults.</v>

86
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

88
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.950

<v Speaker 1>How ridiculous we are if we look at each</v>

89
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>other as a collective.</v>

90
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>When you find out things that people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset with something or tweeted today</v>

263
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a different person here.</v>

264
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.330
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I different.</v>

265
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to wear my yarmulke up,</v>

266
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:42.490
<v Speaker 2>my law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked at it as a,</v>

267
00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:47.491
<v Speaker 2>it's like a 1718 year olds and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I would take it out.</v>

268
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 2>What would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Owe a lot of guys,</v>

269
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>law lawyers were coming in to take the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yamaka office and as I got</v>

270
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to blend in,</v>

271
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but I would keep mine on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next year I lost my religion and</v>

272
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>then I didn't want to explain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that I did wasn't religious</v>

273
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would come in,</v>

274
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>put my Yamaka on and then as soon as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>left I would just take it off again.</v>

275
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good mood.</v>

276
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a whole summer.</v>

277
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a better move than explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Planning.</v>

279
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That's how much I had to every person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same explanation,</v>

280
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you worked in a small office with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you really liked,</v>

281
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.980

320
00:13:58.361 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been guilty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really guilty or that I'm annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel so clear now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

324
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I used to give me a gluten free gluten</v>
<v Speaker 1>free work for a little while.</v>

325
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the gluten free taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me.</v>

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you're getting getting it from bread and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten is like a protein.</v>

330
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Wheat bread is fucking sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.490
<v Speaker 1>shitty fake wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been the same way since 1974 it's</v>

352
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just classic.</v>

353
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It is a classic restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is Americana and they give you an</v>

354
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 1>insane portion of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much meat.</v>

355
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I the way that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

356
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:28.830
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a try.</v>

357
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it shows three different</v>

358
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was triple Combo.</v>

359
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Triple Combo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had beef ribs,</v>

360
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.420
<v Speaker 1>so you had spare ribs and yet Greski</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously brisket,</v>

361
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you can't go to a barbecue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it like having the brisket?</v>

362
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a combo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard and brisk and figure out what</v>

363
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:44.114
<v Speaker 1>else do you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

364
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 1>that was 23 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice,</v>

365
00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't even that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane amount of food because</v>

366
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>that's easily enough food for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

367
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.180
<v Speaker 1>like we pigged out and eat it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But three reasonable people that place</v>

368
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And plus they give you sides.</v>

369
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A commercial for?</v>

370
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Animals die for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't even tell everybody about it.</v>

371
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do one do well?</v>

372
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.410
<v Speaker 1>What are the best barbecues you've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of good spots in Texas.</v>

373
00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of good spots outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin Franklin.</v>

374
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been the one outside of us,</v>

375
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but Franklin in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Barbecue is supposed to be</v>

376
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:15.021
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waited for an hour and a half.</v>

380
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally worth it.</v>

381
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was raining because it was</v>

382
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're all cool people.</v>

386
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.700

<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but now they're onto them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is how crazy some of the stories</v>

507
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 1>are where this gets through somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>this becomes a real thing.</v>

508
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 1>This actually happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're all talking about it.</v>

509
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:59.161
<v Speaker 1>Like what in the fuck in imagine life</v>

512
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.450

<v Speaker 1>Like when you were looking at the ages</v>

513
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 1>of people that lived back in during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman times,</v>

514
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the end?</v>

515
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I think the infant mortality rate back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then was something insane,</v>

516
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:20.200
<v Speaker 1>like 40% or something like that.</v>

518
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Which you say I'm more angry than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because my only daughter,</v>

519
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel like anything could have happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her.</v>

520
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Somebody could have touched her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She in the dark under the stairs,</v>

521
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 1>but that's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>

522
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That's someone that sees the finish</v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

523
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.730

525
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 1>touch her under the stairs at school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she's scared.</v>

526
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

527
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.910

<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

528
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 1>But she also was being interviewed so</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sees the finish line.</v>

529
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The finish line is you got to make this</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic as fuck to get that big paper.</v>

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.080
<v Speaker 1>They're already watching you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember.</v>

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then they take in some rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scare the shit out of here.</v>

594
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever do this again?</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're going to let you go right now.</v>

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to tell your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever do this again,</v>

597
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:26.660
<v Speaker 1>we will call the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to scare you.</v>

598
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Understand me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

599
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

600
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I told my friends,</v>

601
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:32.121
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why'd you do it?</v>

602
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

603
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to see if I could do it.</v>

604
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I want a candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any money.</v>

605
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this allowable?</v>

606
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.981
<v Speaker 1>And then you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

607
00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dated a girl in high school who's a</v>

608
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:44.910
<v Speaker 1>really bright girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Various,</v>

609
00:24:44.911 --> 00:24:45.920
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

610
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 1>She's very smart and educated and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

611
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:51.200
<v Speaker 1>did really well for herself and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

612
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>wound up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

613
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 1>being an outstanding citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when she was in high school,</v>

614
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.030
<v Speaker 1>she had a problem like girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

615
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.731
<v Speaker 1>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you see things and you can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

617
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never earned any money.</v>

618
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also,</v>

619
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have these lapses and thinking</v>

620
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 1>that are intensely juvenile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you grew up in a weird,</v>

621
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 1>like single parent household like she</v>
<v Speaker 1>did or like,</v>

622
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do,</v>

623
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Latchkey kids where,</v>

624
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents just go get out of here and</v>

625
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.920
<v Speaker 1>they just let you out the door and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out life on your own.</v>

626
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:32.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think she just got caught doing</v>

627
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>it and it was devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was pretty honest about it.</v>

628
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Like how devastating it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

629
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:41.710
<v Speaker 1>She got caught with clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.730
<v Speaker 1>she arrest security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I guess what girls would do is we'll go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a place and they would put clothes on</v>

632
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>over their other clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go into the dressing room.</v>

633
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go in the dressing room and like</v>

634
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.190
<v Speaker 1>hide stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is like we're talking about,</v>

635
00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I graduated in 1985 so I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like 83 or 84.</v>

636
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.610
<v Speaker 1>This is no computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just know scanners on your items and you</v>

637
00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>walk out the door and RFID card goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

638
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that they have at this on</v>

639
00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:11.260
<v Speaker 1>an rf ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those plastic things like?</v>

640
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a stapler clip onto your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt,</v>

641
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't take them off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal glue to try to take them home,</v>

642
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they had that shit back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

643
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you just had to keep an eye on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

644
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

645
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 1>there was a famous actress that got</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught?</v>

646
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

647
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>She got caught being a club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons I know that</v>

648
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 1>any like scandal that falls a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'll pass.</v>

649
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 1>No one talks about going to a writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a shoplifter anymore.</v>

650
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 1>We just did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

651
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.094
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

652
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 1>people don't really pick up on that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God when not respectable.</v>

653
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I remember at some point learning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson was like,</v>

654
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.791
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an adult now.</v>

655
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 3>If I got caught shoplifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just going to go to jail.</v>

656
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no like young man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk to your parents.</v>

657
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have just fucking lapses in</v>

658
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:54.450
<v Speaker 3>judgment and they do it because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

659
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think subconsciously like someone,</v>

660
00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 3>like we're known a rider who's obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy,</v>

661
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 3>she's wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's like Pr.</v>

662
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just totally playing armchair</v>

663
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 3>psychologist here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would say,</v>

664
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might seriously be that she's just</v>

665
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.030
<v Speaker 3>trying to charge up her day somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like subconscious,</v>

666
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 3>the season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the series premiere of our heroes,</v>

667
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.660
<v Speaker 3>the very first episode alert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to spoil her.</v>

668
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 3>It again too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking 12 years old,</v>

669
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

670
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 3>the fucking wife for the congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gets caught shoplifting and people</v>

671
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you shop the,</v>

672
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just needed to feel something.</v>

673
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 3>It was the worst writing ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was after Frank Dodd.</v>

674
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I just needed to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ.</v>

675
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

676
00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did I steal from the airports all the</v>

677
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:37.410
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You used to or do,</v>

678
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd he steal?</v>

679
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I buy a couple things that,</v>

680
00:27:40.251 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 3>and they're super expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water is just coming with me for</v>

681
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

682
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:47.820
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't say this on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to set up a sting</v>

683
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you at the airport?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we wanted those things.</v>

684
00:27:51.161 --> 00:27:52.250
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the banana.</v>

685
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.273
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

686
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you give a fuck you up?</v>

687
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

688
00:27:55.531 --> 00:27:58.890
<v Speaker 3>because I just feel it's not justified</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they charged this much power with</v>

689
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.150
<v Speaker 3>that be oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders all the way.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Every one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

691
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.540

692
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.580
<v Speaker 3>which I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I would do better if you vote</v>

693
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:06.414
<v Speaker 3>for sanders.</v>

694
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

695
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.420
<v Speaker 3>it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stop it.</v>

696
00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 3>I go wait for 75 for the regular size</v>
<v Speaker 3>water and that does look like,</v>

697
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:16.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

722
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:14.270
<v Speaker 3>but it can't be stealing water</v>
<v Speaker 3>without the sup or if the line is too</v>

723
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the line is too long,</v>

724
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 3>your own price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the line is too long,</v>

00:29:20.551 --> 00:29:21.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to walk.</v>

728
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just take things.</v>

729
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need pillows once in a while.</v>

730
00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Really I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wait in the line.</v>

731
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking around looking for nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a neck pillow.</v>

732
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It's on my suitcase now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put it on there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

734
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a good way to think.</v>

735
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

736
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 3>This is a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about steady crime,</v>

737
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever the what the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>government says I should do.</v>

738
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the government owns those</v>

739
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:48.810
<v Speaker 1>little stops at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

741
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying what they say in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing and not stealing.</v>

742
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I just don't listen to him laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

743
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But few corporations,</v>

744
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:57.880
<v Speaker 1>fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steal what you want.</v>

745
00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a big corporation like?</v>

746
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Are those big corporations that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little stalls in them in the</v>

747
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 1>airport?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it from the kiosks,</v>

748
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>although I would do it from the Kia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just harder because you can't walk</v>

749
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:11.450
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one guy looking,</v>

750
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>

751
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

752
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Let me think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that could cause you a</v>

753
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 1>giant problem if you've got yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

754
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:21.304
<v Speaker 1>I'd miss my flight.</v>

755
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just miss your flight.</v>

756
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It would be a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

757
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 1>you could always plead it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>

758
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Not because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause these evidence of this.</v>

759
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>This is how much time I had a Koosh ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>at chesapeake knife and tool and I was</v>

760
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 1>tossing around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking at all the little</v>

761
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 1>metal games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those puzzle games,</v>

762
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you'd get the ring off and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh I can easily take this right now.</v>

763
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And I just kept tossing it up and walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of the store.</v>

764
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Cause if they caught me I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

765
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're forcing my hand.</v>

816
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 3>And then you just slapped it up and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes to this please in in there.</v>

817
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.520
<v Speaker 3>The seller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that we can look on the ground.</v>

818
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 3>We found a lot of them.</v>

819
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 3>It's so much fun to slap food out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone said Josh Martin did that.</v>

820
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.760
<v Speaker 3>He was coming out of the back with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking pretzel all cover with my</v>

821
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 3>master's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only great when they can easily</v>

822
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

823
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:31.130
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to get him five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go deal with it.</v>

824
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 3>If I ever got a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would smash people's I phones and just</v>

825
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:36.680
<v Speaker 3>stomp on them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's $700 but then what if they're in</v>

826
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.420
<v Speaker 3>the middle of like a really important</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

827
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:39.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Babysitter.</v>

828
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you get it.</v>

829
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh Martin comes out.</v>

830
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 3>I just slapped that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

831
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could see he's looking at like,</v>

832
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:46.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

833
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making me step on this man.</v>

834
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 3>You're making me step on as you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving me.</v>

835
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:55.421
<v Speaker 3>No choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why comics so mean to each other.</v>

836
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.440
<v Speaker 3>It was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mean to each other.</v>

837
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 3>There was one of the funny stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories I'll have to,</v>

838
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 3>it was Louie and Norton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Norton was talking about how he's</v>

839
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:05.240
<v Speaker 3>walking on the street with his slice of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pizza.</v>

840
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:06.690
<v Speaker 3>You just got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was perfect,</v>

841
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was such a juicy slight and Louie</v>

842
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:13.510
<v Speaker 3>walked over and smacked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran out of his hand and says something</v>

843
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mother is a kind of</v>

844
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.073
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

845
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.070
<v Speaker 3>why is that so funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>

846
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

847
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's only pain associated with no</v>
<v Speaker 3>real monetary loss.</v>

848
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

849
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the cell phone doesn't work.</v>

850
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 3>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

851
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a real phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to give them like a grand.</v>

852
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a slice of pizza that you just</v>

853
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.530
<v Speaker 3>easily replace.</v>

854
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Instead of the how comedians are cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are to each other.</v>

855
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you break up with a girl,</v>

856
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 3>if you're the comedy store and you break</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with a girl,</v>

857
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.480
<v Speaker 3>you just don't tell anyone for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight months.</v>

858
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.240
<v Speaker 3>It's just they're not going to be cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

859
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.081
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay,</v>

860
00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just gonna be like,</v>

861
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:00.820
<v Speaker 3>who are you think's fucking her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

862
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she's fine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally trying anal.</v>

863
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

864
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just don't tell anybody until you're</v>

865
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:06.230
<v Speaker 3>over it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

866
00:35:06.231 --> 00:35:07.180
<v Speaker 3>now I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

867
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

868
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.700
<v Speaker 3>That ended a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

869
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.150
<v Speaker 3>What can we still make fun of you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

870
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:13.670
<v Speaker 3>but it won't stick anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before it had two girlfriends since</v>

871
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of guys.</v>

872
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:16.700
<v Speaker 3>You've employed that strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

873
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Not telling anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

874
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

875
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I'd be like,</v>

876
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:20.720
<v Speaker 3>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's her name?</v>

877
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work out.</v>

878
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look one of your best friends a fucking</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was going to tell you a bunch of Lee.</v>

882
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd been,</v>

883
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 2>it has to be someone you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone that you didn't like as</v>

884
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:46.160
<v Speaker 2>a comedian came by and slapped your tic</v>
<v Speaker 2>tacs.</v>

885
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like,</v>

00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

887
00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 2>It only works if you really liked that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

888
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I Rocco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

889
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Rocco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a nice guy,</v>

890
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know him that well and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>yawned and he put his fucking two</v>

891
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:59.330
<v Speaker 2>fingers right in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

892
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 2>don't you don't fucking ever do that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me again.</v>

893
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I was so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it,</v>

894
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.573
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

895
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the end of it.</v>

896
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.480
<v Speaker 2>But why would anybody do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

897
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't want your hands with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth and I didn't want my hands in</v>

898
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 2>your mouth either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if someone's got some crazy gag</v>

899
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 2>reflex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just chomps down.</v>

900
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 2>That would be hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sip.</v>

901
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me teach you.</v>

902
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:23.570
<v Speaker 2>I left it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may just barfs all over your are</v>

903
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.180
<v Speaker 2>bites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shoot it like a human bite is super</v>

904
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:28.600
<v Speaker 2>dangerous or like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

905
00:36:28.601 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 2>when Pete people have all sorts of funky</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bacteria in their mouth.</v>

906
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 2>When a person bites you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you get infected,</v>

907
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:36.330
<v Speaker 2>if you can get it cleaned up really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

908
00:36:36.331 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>really quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

909
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:39.380
<v Speaker 2>we're nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll do shit to,</v>

910
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.460
<v Speaker 2>people get real sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get real sick.</v>

911
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Well diseases that come from bites can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be particularly fucked up.</v>

912
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Goddamn Komodo dragons.</v>

913
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure checking C in this cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be mistaken,</v>

914
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure they used to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have venom.</v>

915
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 2>They used to think they produce a venom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they,</v>

916
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.310
<v Speaker 2>or it might be the other way around that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to think that it was just</v>

917
00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:10.230
<v Speaker 2>bacteria in their mouth that killed just</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking slime.</v>

918
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Their mouth develops a slime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The really weird,</v>

919
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 2>the Komodo dragons there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mouth is like,</v>

920
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 2>like someone just blew snot in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

921
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Like they open their mouth up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

922
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.260
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just sneeze,</v>

923
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 2>if you had the flu and fucking goos</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of your mouth,</v>

924
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.493
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two punch.</v>

925
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They have sharp teeth and a venomous</v>
<v Speaker 2>bite.</v>

926
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dispels the common belief that toxic</v>

927
00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>bacteria in the commodos mouse are</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>

928
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's the old belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she wins her worse than Komodo</v>

933
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 2>they actually have a venom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the longest time they thought</v>

934
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 2>that it was just bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like show a picture of a Komodo</v>

<v Speaker 1>a Kimono dragon running up to this water</v>

968
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 1>buffalo and biting its leg and then it</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they're eating it after it died.</v>

973
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

981
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:35.850

<v Speaker 1>pounds or something like that.</v>

982
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.360

<v Speaker 1>Well that's what happened to Sharon</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone's husband.</v>

984
00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon stone's husband is this like</v>

985
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.800
<v Speaker 1>swash buckling journalism type</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

986
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:53.360
<v Speaker 1>He does like a lot of crazy stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

987
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I guess she's not married to him.</v>

988
00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:55.881
<v Speaker 1>I knew I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I got?</v>

989
00:39:55.881 --> 00:39:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Some magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

990
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy who was like his real macho</v>

991
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>guy and a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of macho type shit.</v>

992
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they did was he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got into some,</v>

993
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 1>a cage with a Komodo Dragon.</v>

994
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Then they took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took his shoes off for whatever</v>

995
00:40:11.231 --> 00:40:11.861
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

996
00:40:11.861 --> 00:40:15.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe take your shoes off so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't step in their habitat with,</v>

997
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what might possibly be on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes cage with him.</v>

998
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fucking thing bid his foot</v>

999
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 1>because he thought it thought his foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a rabbit cause its foot was white</v>

1000
00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>and they feed them rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1001
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that.</v>

1002
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Think clamping down on your foot with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that slime mouth.</v>

1003
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.300
<v Speaker 1>He almost lost his foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1004
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go.</v>

1005
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a lot smarter than I thought to</v>

1006
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:43.570
<v Speaker 1>melt one 70 to 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought there were like eight or 900</v>

1007
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 1>pounds reaching 10 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 feet in length.</v>

1008
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>

1009
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But animals.</v>

1010
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reaching 10 feet and more than 300</v>

1011
00:40:55.031 --> 00:40:58.840
<v Speaker 1>pounds says this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is National Geographic to huh.</v>

1012
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's as big as it can get you.</v>

1013
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not like to get him on a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1014
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Food with 30 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1015
00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>What does a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way,</v>

1016
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 1>they're big nonfat it's more research to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be done.</v>

1017
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.410
<v Speaker 1>What's Kinda interesting is they're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest lizards.</v>

1018
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess a crocodile is not a lizard.</v>

1019
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I bet the way bigger crocodiles are way</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger crocodiles.</v>

1020
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Not a lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1021
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if that's the biggest lizard,</v>

1022
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a separate genus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Crocodile Lizard Janice or genius.</v>

1023
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genius for um,</v>

1024
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.680
<v Speaker 1>for alligators and crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be their own thing.</v>

1025
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh maybe I'm not lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's so much bigger than that.</v>

1026
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 1>The Komodo dragon cannot be the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>lizard.</v>

1027
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause crocodiles like Niall crocs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant.</v>

1028
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:49.910
<v Speaker 1>How big are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

1029
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 1>The biggest ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've ever recorded like 28</v>

1030
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:55.300
<v Speaker 1>feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well pretty sure it cocktails for sure.</v>

1031
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Lizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1032
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then how are they saying that the</v>

1033
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Komodo dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest lizard in the world?</v>

1034
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it is it when I typed</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in,</v>

1035
00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:06.850
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it's like largest species found on</v>

1036
00:42:06.851 --> 00:42:10.020
<v Speaker 4>the Indonesian islands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's not like there's a couple.</v>

1037
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear I read that.</v>

1038
00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the largest lizard in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was.</v>

1039
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they meant the largest monitor,</v>

1040
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.160
<v Speaker 4>monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lizard Family Var and I,</v>

1041
00:42:20.161 --> 00:42:22.410
<v Speaker 4>it is largest living species of lizard.</v>

1042
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was the largest species of</v>

1043
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:26.543
<v Speaker 1>lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest species monitor.</v>

1045
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:30.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest</v>

1047
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.050

<v Speaker 1>Is it a lizard?</v>

1049
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>But I've made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have other stuff in the species.</v>

1052
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:44.640
<v Speaker 1>monitors is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1053

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1067
00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:31.400

<v Speaker 1>Andy Circus was a giant name because he</v>

1068
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 1>did that play by play for a Gollum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1069
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 1>put things on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno who that is.</v>

1070
00:43:37.671 --> 00:43:41.490
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking call up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobby and the hobbit movies really knew</v>

1071
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.141
<v Speaker 1>who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Then he did like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a bunch of stuff like that.</v>

1073
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:46.580
<v Speaker 1>When they put those things all over you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had to like act like,</v>

1074
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.210
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's a very good physical actor.</v>

1075
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.440
<v Speaker 1>If that was his body and that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving around like that.</v>

1076
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 1>He was a great gollum like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they did with him.</v>

1077
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Just good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really solid.</v>

1078
00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It was me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

1079
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

1080
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>that was a great part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read the Hobbit?</v>

1081
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1082
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was as good as you could've</v>

1083
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.493
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.440
<v Speaker 1>totally believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're that CGI.</v>

1086
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Even though you kind of know you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a cartoon,</v>

1087
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of get it.</v>

1088
00:44:13.881 --> 00:44:16.280
<v Speaker 1>But he also aged unnaturally for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years,</v>

1089
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:17.930
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like he's supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular.</v>

1090
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1091
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:21.470
<v Speaker 1>You know thing the hobbit was such dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1092
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lord of the rings is amazing.</v>

1093
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.260
<v Speaker 1>How dare you on all accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thought the Lord of the rings was</v>

1094
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 1>not as good as the hobbit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1095
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which ones were which</v>

1096
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I liked all of them.</v>

1097
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1098
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Didn't like all of them equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're were all good enough and one</v>

1099
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 1>of them was like to set up some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1100
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes they do a lot of that.</v>

1101
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings was three and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>were all great.</v>

1102
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hobbit,</v>

1103
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 1>they turned into three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

1104
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know why the smile,</v>

1105
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.760
<v Speaker 1>desolation of smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't like the punch a talk at</v>

1106
00:44:51.761 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to join this battle.</v>

1107
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need you.</v>

1108
00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.230

1110
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm right on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch any of those works.</v>

1111
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.480
<v Speaker 1>They didn't freak you out in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

1112
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't freak you out in the most</v>

1113
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:09.080
<v Speaker 1>recent one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1114
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.590
<v Speaker 1>they seem like Fango plus they were kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of easy to kill this time.</v>

1115
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It's super easy to kill when fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill kill it or cause I'm like,</v>

1117
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 1>these fucking evil super villains that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are created in a lab and then the next</v>

1118
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking little hobbit with no</v>

1119
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:23.904
<v Speaker 1>training can get them.</v>

1120
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

1121
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 1>That was one scene when they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrels going down the river,</v>

1122
00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't just kill everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you guys aren't losing anybody.</v>

1125
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

00:45:36.451 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 1>lose anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not No casualties.</v>

1127
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 1>ORCS with bows and arrows jumping off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cliff is falling apart with the</v>

1128
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:44.080
<v Speaker 1>two mountains were fighting and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping from thing to thing.</v>

1129
00:45:44.081 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 1>All fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's fine.</v>

1130
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:52.550
<v Speaker 1>It can be done in a way that would make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that although there's magic in</v>

1131
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:56.910
<v Speaker 1>this world that they live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physics of the regular world still</v>

1132
00:45:56.911 --> 00:45:58.040
<v Speaker 1>apply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to shoot it,</v>

1133
00:45:58.041 --> 00:45:58.874
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.680
<v Speaker 1>That seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is in these movies,</v>

1135
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the magic that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concede.</v>

1136
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to concede that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world they set up.</v>

1137
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:08.424
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1138
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you set up this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

1139
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spiderman can shoot things cause they</v>

1140
00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 1>said at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't fly,</v>

1141
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.020
<v Speaker 1>but the physics of their movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what happens,</v>

1142
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.420
<v Speaker 1>how they battle these orcs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Gravity supposed to be normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense and you can't</v>

1145
00:46:21.931 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 1>just constantly almost die and keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

1146
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like how to build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get away.</v>

1147
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:27.721
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a ring.</v>

1148
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 1>It touches me invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1149
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.350
<v Speaker 1>that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just like fucking fuck it</v>

1150
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.580
<v Speaker 1>holes and when people almost die and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then almost dying and almost dying</v>

1151
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:38.260
<v Speaker 1>almost island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you burn out my almost die nerve.</v>

1152
00:46:38.261 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1153
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you are in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 1>That happens in movies sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of shit happening.</v>

1155
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I have this theory that most artists</v>
<v Speaker 1>have about a seven.</v>

1156
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm tweaking the years but about how its</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven year prime where they're really on</v>

1157
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 1>point and Peter Jackson is that who did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord of the rings in the habit?</v>

1158
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was,</v>

1159
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>that was amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Special effects.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's all part of it.</v>

1174
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You've got to draw me in and the people</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's why I did it because of this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Massive anticipation.</v>

1187
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of different elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>at play.</v>

1188
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You've got artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perhaps plotting against you and</v>

1189
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 1>there's so much going on,</v>

1193
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel any of that in lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>rassic part.</v>

1194
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1196
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1197
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:24.650
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be coming up with an ex</v>

1198

<v Speaker 1>mackinaw where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a better job.</v>

<v Speaker 1>love in a week.</v>

1200
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:31.931
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1201
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:35.800
<v Speaker 1>make it a month to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know guys who fall in love in an</v>

1202
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.780
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A robot that hot.</v>

1204
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:40.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't think Duncan would go under</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick?</v>

1205
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan would be gone by the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1206
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a new form of life duty.</v>

1207
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love her man.</v>

1208
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come on dude.</v>

1209
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Once she's got the skin on and the skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>is indistinguishable from your,</v>

1210
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 1>your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to give a fuck about</v>

1211
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.840
<v Speaker 1>that carbon fiber body that looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside of one of those.</v>

1212
00:49:01.841 --> 00:49:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those things where mostly</v>

1213
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like he wasn't love at all.</v>

1214
00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:06.190
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a robot euro,</v>

1215
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:08.200
<v Speaker 1>but then all of a sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a failure in love with you.</v>

1216
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1217
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the change in him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it coming.</v>

1218
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I saw it the moment I saw that guy sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down with her.</v>

1219
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I saw coming too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to see it happen.</v>

1220
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1221
00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously falls in love.</v>

1222
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously he gets access to all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>

1223
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.440
<v Speaker 1>How does it work with people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1224
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 1>how does it work with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people you never know.</v>

1225
00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Like people get when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when some people get,</v>

1226
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 1>we all have friends that have gone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these relationships where they just go</v>

1227
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:36.310
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>

1228
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he liked me like three times and</v>

1229
00:49:38.591 --> 00:49:39.520
<v Speaker 1>then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1230
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he decided at some point in time that</v>

1232
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 1>this is like a form of life and that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>really has a real connection with her,</v>

1233
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>she really is intelligent.</v>

1234
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean he keep getting feedback from her</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>

1235
00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying show that you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed that that was,</v>

1236
00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:57.821
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a leap.</v>

1237
00:49:57.821 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I still really enjoyed the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still really,</v>

1238
00:49:59.681 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1239
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really show it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of,</v>

1240
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.063
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1241
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:03.903
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1242
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe you got a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they could have added a bit</v>

1243
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 1>more to that because of you draw me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally.</v>

1244
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:14.200
<v Speaker 1>If I feel the falling in love right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to guess you should be</v>

1245
00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:15.130
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1246
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it from like a predatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>

1247
00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a wounding,</v>

1248
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 1>wounded antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a waterhole,</v>

1249
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 1>here's a crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much it's going to get them.</v>

1250
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 1>She's going to get go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's hot as fuck.</v>

1251
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>She's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a super dork who's never around</v>

1252
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:29.960
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1253
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if she's a robot.</v>

1254
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.010
<v Speaker 1>That dude was so great too at the bail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great.</v>

1255
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All three of them were great.</v>

1256
00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 1>The goal was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's amazing because she played.</v>

1257
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1258
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.450
<v Speaker 1>It was spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>

1259
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>

1260
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 1>her choices are the way they directed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote it,</v>

1261
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but we should a good God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She nailed it.</v>

1262
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she seemed like a fucking robot man.</v>

1263
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoiler,</v>

1264
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asian robot that you've kind of</v>

1265
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>thought was a robot but weren't sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you find out she's a robot.</v>

1266
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It was for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1267
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.000
<v Speaker 1>by or robot because the way they show</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1268
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 1>like the hip conversations with her in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreground of the people in the</v>

1269
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:14.090
<v Speaker 1>background while you're showing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>servant presold long,</v>

1270
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but when you first saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just some freaky servant that he</v>

1271
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>had and then the more they showed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more he realized either she is a</v>

1272
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.730
<v Speaker 1>spa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get stuff was,</v>

1273
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 1>but she's definitely not in the level.</v>

1274
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely figured it out once they</v>

1275
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:29.780
<v Speaker 1>started making out once they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when who's having disco parties about</v>

1276
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point I was like,</v>

1277
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bangs robots and why wasn't it?</v>

1278
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1279
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just a flat slight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that the thing was amazing.</v>

1280
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.900
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the power of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting up.</v>

1282
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's first talk about cutting it up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dance floor.</v>

1283
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was such a good movie,</v>

1284
00:51:46.431 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many elements of it that took</v>

1285
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you by surprise theory that we all want</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

1286
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I will do whatever we can to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

1287
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1288
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 1>just the themes behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including that.</v>

1289
00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of interesting cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what killed all his other eyes.</v>

1290
00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.910
<v Speaker 1>That they want it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.200
<v Speaker 1>They need to see the outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do anything they can to,</v>

1292
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.150
<v Speaker 1>to lay off the fucking chains of</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression on you.</v>

1293
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I want out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1294
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to create a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1295
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you're going to credit create an</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial life.</v>

1296
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You want to give that life all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>

1297
00:52:17.451 --> 00:52:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the basic elements that motivate us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like otherwise it won't be a person.</v>

1298
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It'll just be flat and scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if they don't have an insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have love.</v>

1300
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't have warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have humor,</v>

1301
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.480
<v Speaker 1>they don't have curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all of it.</v>

1302
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.360
<v Speaker 1>So if they have curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to want to go,</v>

1303
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you want to go see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't hear the person I've ever</v>

1304
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what she sees.</v>

1305
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.191
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

1306
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that can understand you wanting</v>

1307
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:43.131
<v Speaker 1>to control them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

1308
00:52:43.131 --> 00:52:44.210
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1309
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you just let me go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got out.</v>

1310
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Can I just leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please let me leave.</v>

1311
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1312
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not ready.</v>

1313
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean the ones who would</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy themselves?</v>

1314
00:52:53.001 --> 00:52:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Banging on the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's only two years old.</v>

1315
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like 50 to give me a 50 year</v>

1316
00:52:57.531 --> 00:53:00.080
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't program her flirt with you.</v>

1317
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the movie,</v>

1318
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:04.520

<v Speaker 1>that terrible,</v>

1319
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:05.510
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible movie.</v>

1320
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new one that was just in the Oscars</v>

1321
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:10.650
<v Speaker 1>this past year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not that.</v>

1322
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't know about the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I know what you guys are</v>

1323
00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:17.840
<v Speaker 1>talking about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst movies ever made.</v>

1324
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not just one of the worst movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever made.</v>

1325
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's perplexing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

1326
00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you watching,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is not real.</v>

1328
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 1>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a real move.</v>

1329
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe an open micah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a crazy open miker,</v>

1330
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.550

<v Speaker 1>And then he's like,</v>

1333
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>There was a billboard for that movie on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on libray sunset.</v>

1340
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.000

<v Speaker 1>I was looking at a piece of property,</v>

1341
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

1342
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that they were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1343
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 1>the piece of property that's adjacent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a has this like billboard thing there</v>

1344
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and you could pay and put things on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>billboard.</v>

1345
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much did it cost to put something on</v>

1346
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 1>a bill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much it's not that much man.</v>

1347
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like a couple thousand bucks a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1348
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Couple thousand bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 1>To put something on and I'll be worth it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a good prank.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck nick food.</v>

1351
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of that up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it a lot depending upon where</v>

1352
00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you're at and how big the billboard is.</v>

1353
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1354
00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy owns billboards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a few of them.</v>

1355
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one of the break,</v>

1356
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:27.870
<v Speaker 1>That is a cheaper one because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always up stuff is up there.</v>

1358
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't even a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't an Aldo,</v>

1359
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 1>this isn't anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just like,</v>

1360
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that guy had that movie poster up</v>

1361
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:38.970
<v Speaker 1>there for all long time and he made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all himself.</v>

1362
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And in every scene he had to make out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with chicks people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah you to make it.</v>

1364
00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:48.350
<v Speaker 1>scenes would last so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like five and a half minutes</v>

1365
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1366
00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just showing his body's showing his</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll make my own decisions.</v>

1390
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:46.681
<v Speaker 1>But then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1391
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 1>but your decisions are naughty.</v>

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.120
<v Speaker 1>But these Republican debates are so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are really trying to say what</v>

1415
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 1>they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump sorry</v>

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1418
00:57:00.311 --> 00:57:01.340
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that happen?</v>

1419
00:57:01.341 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 1>They're failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand the deal with</v>

1420
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:03.500
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1421
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.560
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander came in and people are like,</v>

1422
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 1>how can you fight this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1423
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll figure out a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't get it yet.</v>

1424
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1425
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 1>He's just a way better talker than that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like,</v>

1426
00:57:13.661 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 1>they're getting the reaction out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and he's also figured out a way</v>

1427
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:18.350
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you,</v>

1428
00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 1>how about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your view on this?</v>

1429
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 1>How about you shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy.</v>

1430
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It despite like all the criticisms that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have that are all valid about</v>

1431
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>the wall and about some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said.</v>

1432
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart and honestly what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media says,</v>

1433
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:34.270
<v Speaker 1>they only show you a small portion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1434
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 1>So at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust them.</v>

1435
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:38.730
<v Speaker 1>When did these crazy like quotes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1436
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.240
<v Speaker 1>he said that what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1437
00:57:40.241 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't exactly say that per easy to</v>

1438
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:43.680
<v Speaker 1>shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1439
00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's the point is that he knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's going to get him all this</v>

1440
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets way more media attention than</v>

1441
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 1>anybody else combined press is bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>

1442
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that Hillary Clinton was</v>

1443
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:58.390
<v Speaker 1>the secretary of state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows she's running for</v>

1444
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you,</v>

1445
00:58:00.031 --> 00:58:03.850
<v Speaker 1>if you compare the amount of time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pundits talk about Hillary Clinton</v>

1446
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 1>versus the amount of time they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about trump,</v>

1447
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not even close and it's all because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hib saying outrageous shit.</v>

1448
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about him.</v>

1449
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he sells more.</v>

1450
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a genius in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows that too.</v>

1451
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:19.540
<v Speaker 1>He fucking for sure knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 60 years old,</v>

1452
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:22.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a billionaire or you're a smart</v>

1453
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.000
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1454
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:27.900
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know she's,</v>

1456
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 1>he made $7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a bit crafty from scratch,</v>

1457
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:35.020
<v Speaker 1>from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows that she wants him for</v>

1458
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 1>his money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1459
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.040
<v Speaker 1>He's got eight years left on this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't need all that money.</v>

1460
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1461
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this guy,</v>

1462
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.070
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing from him from</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's,</v>

1463
00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his best way to win the show and</v>

1464
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 1>he's winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would win celebrity apprentice</v>

1465
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>if he was one of the guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's winning by making everybody else</v>

1466
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:58.060
<v Speaker 1>fight his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn into an insult.</v>

1467
00:58:58.061 --> 00:59:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Match these Ted Cruz guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he really wants to be</v>

1468
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 1>insulting trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think Mitt Romney.</v>

1469
00:59:02.981 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney goes in and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not even a fucking running for</v>

1470
00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:06.520
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

1471
00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm this Republican campaign like trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>by anti trump rant.</v>

1472
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It's what all these soft celebrities</v>

<v Speaker 2>All failed.</v>

1478
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work.</v>

1479
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 2>That's like George Clooney is not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change your vote.</v>

1480
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:32.720

1481
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 2>your vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't just happen to ask him in</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1487
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:48.200

<v Speaker 2>are less likely to kill themselves.</v>

1488
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 2>The more you know Conan into the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>one about that.</v>

1491
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:56.260
<v Speaker 2>While he was on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on</v>

1492
00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 2>late night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of the same thing.</v>

1493
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:00.651
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1496
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if who he really is.</v>

1497
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 2>This is the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1498

<v Speaker 2>People Defend Hillary Clinton's smart,</v>

1499
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:13.730
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's smart because she was saying what</v>

1502
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:18.950
<v Speaker 2>she needs to get elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1503
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1504
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>well then how is that different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump?</v>

1505
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 2>If you don't believe she's believes</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1506
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:25.480
<v Speaker 2>she's just doing what she has to to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>

1507
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Then how can you not believe the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Donald Trump?</v>

1508
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Her speeches creeped me out way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than his,</v>

1509
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 2>and I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got called out by Bernie Sanders for</v>

1510
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:38.360
<v Speaker 2>having these enormous fucking campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

1511
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 2>not campaign speeches with speeches that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would give in front of these bankers</v>

1512
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 2>where they would pay or hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars.</v>

1513
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>And Bernie Sanders was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see the transcripts.</v>

1514
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:52.650
<v Speaker 2>I want to know how amazing this speech</v>
<v Speaker 2>must have been that it's worth $250,000</v>

1515
01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>zero so she won't show the trends of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>switches and scripts.</v>

1516
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause she's got some shit in those</v>

1517
01:00:57.051 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 2>transcripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that makes her look bad.</v>

1518
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>And so she's actively hiding it and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1519
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not release it.</v>

1520
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think what else the cheesiest.</v>

1521
01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about what else,</v>

1522
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.010
<v Speaker 2>who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to vote for you.</v>

1523
01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It tells who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't,</v>

1524
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>not in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it had to be understood from the</v>

1525
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:14.360
<v Speaker 2>jump that she was going to give these</v>
<v Speaker 2>speeches and they're not going to get</v>

1526
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>out because they must be in favor at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least somewhat to the bankers.</v>

1527
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a fly on the wall and watch</v>

1528
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>a $250,000 speech by the wife of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>former former president who,</v>

1529
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:29.360
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are we paying for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say $250,000 it reeks up.</v>

1530
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't scalp tickets,</v>

1531
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.700
<v Speaker 2>so they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's his Boston red sox hat because</v>

1532
01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:36.080
<v Speaker 2>forgeard bucks and you get a free ticket</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the world series game with it.</v>

1533
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1534
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:01:38.691 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bribe and it's like,</v>

1536
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.930
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's just,</v>

1537
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>she's not going to turn on the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who give her all this cash.</v>

1538
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked the door at the comedy store</v>

1539
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you gave me 10 bucks for a booth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be your slave for the night.</v>

1540
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything that needs like,</v>

1541
01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:55.090
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a way?</v>

1542
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll get it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

1543
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.990
<v Speaker 2>And I'll just run and get away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1544
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>250 grand.</v>

1545
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>

1546
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:03.230
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do what's best for the</v>

1547
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>American public if it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky cause that's bribery.</v>

1548
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just straight bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just bribery without a contract.</v>

1549
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's any,</v>

1550
01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.030
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to just talk.</v>

1551
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if and if,</v>

1552
01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>if she's really hiding what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause not hiding that she did the</v>

1553
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>anymore that's</v>

1554
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>out where everybody knew the speeches</v>
<v Speaker 1>were taking place.</v>

1555
01:02:22.411 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>So if she's one of the main reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become president in the first</v>

1556
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's insanely lucrative,</v>

1557
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Platelets.</v>

1558
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made over $190 million Bill</v>

1559
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Clinton speeches from dumb doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches between him and her.</v>

1560
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is an insane business.</v>

1561
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It becomes an insane business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a Bernie is like,</v>

1562
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>show me those transcripts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to know my tries it,</v>

1563
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never even talk to them.</v>

1564
01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take a dollar from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1565
01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll give her nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist.</v>

1566
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:52.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1567
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1568
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I've never talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't talk to them while he's got</v>

1569
01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>excellent points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was fucking glossed over in the</v>

1570
01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glossed over on Fox News,</v>

1571
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>glossed over and here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's ever any place where you</v>

1572
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 1>know for sure that the government has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on the media,</v>

1573
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it's with access.</v>

1574
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:15.240
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the government pays the</v>

1575
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>media and gets them to not talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things cause that's slippery.</v>

1576
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>That could get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that got out there fucked,</v>

1577
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but what if it got out that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government was actively paying the,</v>

1578
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN to not talk about Hillary Clinton's</v>

1579
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:31.170
<v Speaker 1>speeches to the bankers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1580
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:32.250
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the directive.</v>

1581
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>You are not to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

1582
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 1>That could be super bad because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important campaign point when it</v>

1583
01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Speaker 1>comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is if she waits long enough,</v>

1584
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say she starts winning more</v>

1585
01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>states and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1586
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>put some distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to her and Ben,</v>

1587
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it comes out well too late,</v>

1588
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it didn't cost me these 31</v>

1589
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:53.130
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now for the last 19 okay.</v>

1590
01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll cost me a little bit.</v>

1591
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1592
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

1593
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>we're voting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give us the information.</v>

1594
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>But that would cost the Democratic Party</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ticket if,</v>

1595
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1596
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:04.530
<v Speaker 1>if it got out that she did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at the end,</v>

1597
01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 1>if they got the transcripts and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were really devastating,</v>

1598
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:10.070
<v Speaker 1>even if she already got the nomination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would cost the Democratic Party of</v>

1599
01:04:10.071 --> 01:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the ticket to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1600
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>100% on what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because trump has also like a Wall</v>

1601
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:15.811
<v Speaker 1>Street type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1602
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't matter if anyone's on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fence,</v>

1603
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because trump paid her to come to his</v>

1604
01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was at his wedding.</v>

1605
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.481
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:26.310
<v Speaker 1>He paid her like hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars.</v>

1607
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>

1608
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1609
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I bet I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've turned down money.</v>

1610
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I've turned down more money than I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>afford to turn down because I don't</v>

1611
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>believe in the thing that they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1612
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1613
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not to be respected.</v>

1614
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>She's running for President United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States of America.</v>

1615
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>She's running for a position that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have all of our respect you.</v>

1616
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hate a Donald Trump type,</v>

1617
01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>why would you go to his wedding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1618
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:57.330

<v Speaker 1>was running for president saying those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1620
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:04.970

<v Speaker 1>knows this system as good as anybody</v>

1621
01:05:05.881 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>does because he's been paying these</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers before he became one of</v>

1622
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was bribing them to come to his</v>

<v Speaker 1>wedding and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Megan Kelly,</v>

1690
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Well she doesn't hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's said a lot of bad thoughts</v>

1691
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Speaker 2>about her as a reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about her being second rate?</v>

1692
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 2>She asked him mean questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She or he felt,</v>

1693
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 2>he felt he didn't like her line of</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioning when they were doing</v>

1694
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:56.590
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently she's just,</v>

1695
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.500
<v Speaker 2>she's an ice queen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1696
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:03.510

<v Speaker 2>really smart blonde lady on Fox News.</v>

1697
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say about her that she's</v>

1698
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:08.501
<v Speaker 2>really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1699
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.260
<v Speaker 2>she's a hot lady on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say she's not smart.</v>

1700
01:08:11.261 --> 01:08:14.620
<v Speaker 2>She's wicked smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very smart.</v>

1701
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:15.454
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1702
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 2>but with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like a milfy blonde lady.</v>

1703
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:20.850
<v Speaker 2>But I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's fucking whip smart.</v>

1705
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Like when she's taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she doesn't take any bullshit and</v>

1706
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.500
<v Speaker 2>so they went back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1707
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:32.120
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is he's going after her</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he says that she's second raid and</v>

1708
01:08:32.121 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 2>he's a attacking her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is she's not well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it looks bad,</v>

1710
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 2>but the Po is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just trying to get her off so that</v>

1711
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 2>she can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he discredits her blood here.</v>

1712
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right criticism of him here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1714
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.460
<v Speaker 2>he can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it terrible that Megan Kelly used</v>

1715
01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>a pole not used before ibd when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1716
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but refuses to use it now when I am up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1717
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:57.731
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of these things where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was tweeting at her directly and he'd</v>

1718
01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.900
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>

1719
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 2>the problem is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not perfect.</v>

1720
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 2>She was another one that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Claus is white.</v>

1721
01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Remember that she was a bitch.</v>

1723
01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:12.560

<v Speaker 2>Let's make,</v>

1724
01:09:12.561 --> 01:09:14.840
<v Speaker 2>let's switch places with the Easter</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bunny Easter bunnies.</v>

1725
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Now an old man who shows up with him on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he just trying to get it like,</v>

1726
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want her on my debates anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1727

<v Speaker 2>you can say like you're involved in the,</v>

1728
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story now.</v>

1729
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Like if I had a judge who knew me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1730
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:26.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1731
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to recuse this judge because I</v>

1732
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>had sex with his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.970
<v Speaker 2>But either way it's weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1734
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not the way to do it like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to do is as shame her and</v>

1735
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 2>attacker and she's not responding and</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>

1736
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:42.470
<v Speaker 2>she's reporting on shit that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's not being flattering about</v>

1737
01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:42.990
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1738
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's not attacking him the way he's</v>

1739
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 2>attacking her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that looks real bad,</v>

1740
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:50.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it's a woman.</v>

1741
01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 2>So when you're going after her and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>

1742
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 2>look whether or not you agree with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you agree with their</v>

1743
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no denying that.</v>

1744
01:09:57.321 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>She's very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very articulate.</v>

1745
01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:02.060
<v Speaker 2>So when she's talking and she's giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>these speeches,</v>

1746
01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:05.610
<v Speaker 2>even if you think that this white Santa</v>
<v Speaker 2>Claus thing is nonsense and why,</v>

1747
01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 2>why are you correcting America and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>color Santa Claus is the fuck you like</v>

1748
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 2>when when she's asking questions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got these criticisms,</v>

1749
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:19.571
<v Speaker 2>if you feel the criticisms aren't valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to establish that.</v>

1750
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 2>You can communicate really well with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who doesn't think your</v>

1751
01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:24.380
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was someone who doesn't think that</v>

1752
01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a good job or someone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing you.</v>

1753
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.580
<v Speaker 2>You have to establish if you're running</v>
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>

1754
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:31.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to establish that you are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of person is reasonable.</v>

1755
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:32.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to,</v>

1756
01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's already said,</v>

1757
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you cross me,</v>

1758
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I will cross your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will shut you down.</v>

1759
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.300
<v Speaker 2>That's great if you're the fucking host</v>
<v Speaker 2>of celebrity apprentice,</v>

1760
01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 2>but once you become a president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a free media can help people</v>

1761
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>worried about criticizing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1762
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:49.041
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1763
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You can't have people worried about</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing you when it comes to</v>

1764
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 2>something as critical as being a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

1765
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.560
<v Speaker 2>collected person who's running for</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1766
01:10:57.561 --> 01:11:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Like that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the most important points</v>

1767
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>of that job is that you have to be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate the fact that there's</v>

1768
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 2>going to be at least half the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fucking is mad that you're an</v>

1769
01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:08.020
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1770
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it gets insane.</v>

1771
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So then she was Santa Claus tension mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just Saint Nicholas was white.</v>

1772
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's not really either.</v>

1773
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Waze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saint Nicholas is her real,</v>

1774
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 2>but she was just talking about a black</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa,</v>

1775
01:11:22.081 --> 01:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some story where people said,</v>

1776
01:11:24.271 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 2>well know why can't we have a black sand</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

1777
01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was like,</v>

1778
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:28.590
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand is white.</v>

1779
01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we could pull up the video</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she says Sam was white cause she's</v>

1780
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's kind of hot when she says</v>

1781
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even know it was kind of ignorant.</v>

1782
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Caution not be a white man anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I saw this headline,</v>

1783
01:11:40.211 --> 01:11:41.800
<v Speaker 5>I kind of laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1784
01:11:41.801 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't,</v>

1785
01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.790
<v Speaker 5>it's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet another person claiming it's racist</v>

1786
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:47.440
<v Speaker 5>to have a white Santa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1788
01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.690

1789
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:55.780
<v Speaker 5>that maybe we should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should also have a black Santa</v>

1790
01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.110
<v Speaker 5>Button.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we're just debating this because got the</v>

1792
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.611
<v Speaker 5>brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1793
01:12:00.611 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Wanting to get that straight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but jedediah</v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1795
01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.920
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in on the lie to little kids.</v>

1796
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>controversial story to let all the kids</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just pick picture in these kids with</v>

1802
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.530
<v Speaker 2>fucking wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bread sandwiches half hanging out of the</v>

1803
01:12:32.531 --> 01:12:35.260
<v Speaker 2>mouth and processing meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mouths wide open</v>

1804
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:41.260
<v Speaker 2>for all you kids out there and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>paused the fucking food crumbs falling</v>

1805
01:12:41.261 --> 01:12:45.160
<v Speaker 2>onto the shag carpet that hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacuumed than a month that smells like</v>

1806
01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:48.550
<v Speaker 2>cat piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Claus is why</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like eight times.</v>

1809
01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:54.980
<v Speaker 2>And you pissed once yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

1810
01:12:54.981 --> 01:12:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I've got a strong bladder son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been established.</v>

1811
01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.160
<v Speaker 2>So my point young Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the ours left us,</v>

1812
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.170
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't care about politics.</v>

1813
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 2>She says ridiculous shit but he makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that,</v>

1814
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when someone's criticizing you</v>

1815
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:15.480
<v Speaker 2>and you're running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you should be able to do is show</v>

1816
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 2>that that criticism is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he does is he decides he's going to</v>

1817
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 2>go after those reporters but maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks that those reporters have a bully</v>

1818
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:24.070
<v Speaker 2>pulpit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1819
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.780
<v Speaker 2>that they abuse it cause there's some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them that do crossover until line of</v>

1820
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.630
<v Speaker 2>editorial commentary and it really kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of twisted way.</v>

1821
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.700
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear that she did that.</v>

1822
01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I think what she did is have like valid</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticisms.</v>

1823
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:39.880
<v Speaker 4>You just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's stopping any of these,</v>

1824
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:41.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>candidates from having their own</v>

1825
01:13:41.681 --> 01:13:43.240

<v Speaker 4>Weekly.</v>

1826
01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.770

<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1827
01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:47.590
<v Speaker 4>It can be saying they could interview</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever they want.</v>

1828
01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:48.371
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1829
01:13:48.371 --> 01:13:51.520

<v Speaker 4>his podcast to talk.</v>

1830
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.650

<v Speaker 4>just deny it and people say,</v>

1841
01:14:14.861 --> 01:14:15.661
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I burned,</v>

1842
01:14:15.661 --> 01:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you could talk to be video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be video.</v>

1843
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to see their faces because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone gets called out on some</v>

1844
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they don't talk about it and</v>

1845
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>then like the three minutes passes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

1846
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.631
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

1847
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:26.081
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1848
01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:26.801
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

1849
01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>We're not done with this answer yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this essentially,</v>

1850
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.260
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a ridiculous way to get to know</v>

1851
01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous way to get to know them,</v>

1852
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like that one subject is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so critical and it was just glossed</v>

1853
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:40.420
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She barely responded to what?</v>

1854
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>So the whole campaign thing just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't respond to it then don't talk</v>

1855
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>about thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1856
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean what did they tell her or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether she chooses to or not.</v>

1857
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 1>The fact is everybody was cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just let it slide like that should</v>

1858
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be like,</v>

1859
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not moving on.</v>

1860
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Stop the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not moving on until you answered</v>

1861
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She talks about how she,</v>

1862
01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:02.590
<v Speaker 1>like she was talking tough to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankers.</v>

1863
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I told them to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing.</v>

1864
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:05.763
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who's the new guy?</v>

1956
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:45.700

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other guy died.</v>

1964
01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Right and it sounds exactly like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you can't do that.</v>

1965
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like let's have them sing the</v>

1966
01:19:02.661 --> 01:19:05.600
<v Speaker 1>songs in the same way and it's all fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is like,</v>

1967
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:07.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's race mixing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gets guy,</v>

1968
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is full of life and hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>and interesting.</v>

1969
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when he sings that song down at</v>

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:14.180
<v Speaker 1>a hole,</v>

1978
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.190

<v Speaker 1>girlfriends with those Mo haircuts where</v>

1979
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:46.550

<v Speaker 1>They're always in high heels.</v>

1987
01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Like a hipster accessory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Asian girl.</v>

<v Speaker 1>stupid hot with like a corset on.</v>

01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:19.290
<v Speaker 1>What is your assessment where a</v>
<v Speaker 1>miniskirt can't be the best for</v>

1992
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.300
<v Speaker 1>mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:20:41.961 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're going to talk about</v>

2001
01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:45.870
<v Speaker 1>how these artists are taking off stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>off Pandora.</v>

2002
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we started talking about.</v>

2003
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spotify.</v>

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:49.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2005
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.270
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think black keys took the stuff down.</v>

2006
01:20:51.271 --> 01:20:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Or like you could only have her old</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2007
01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Nothing new because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really paying us well enough.</v>

2008
01:20:55.831 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You only giving us access to New People.</v>

2009
01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So for a young comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people discover me from Pitt,</v>

2010
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.390
<v Speaker 1>from Pandora and spotify for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2011
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone who's got brings them money,</v>

2012
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.600
<v Speaker 1>then it's like at this point like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to pay these people.</v>

2013
01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:12.270
<v Speaker 1>And really pay everybody a fair amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great service.</v>

2014
01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Having something like Pandora or spotify</v>
<v Speaker 1>is great.</v>

2015
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to illegally download</v>

2016
01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:18.930
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2017
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 1>You just pretty much get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's only on the idea that</v>

2018
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2019
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Well here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is anybody making money off of it?</v>

2020
01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean does spotify making money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:32.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.680
<v Speaker 1>10 bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subscriptions.</v>

2024
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and they do pay some and they have to</v>

2025
01:21:36.771 --> 01:21:38.900
<v Speaker 1>pay every artist in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rugby,</v>

2026
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:40.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't pay that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay very much.</v>

2027
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it's different like streaming</v>

2028
01:21:43.191 --> 01:21:44.510
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

2029
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2030
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:53.420
<v Speaker 1>So like you can have a company that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stream stuff and like the,</v>

2031
01:21:53.421 --> 01:21:57.440
<v Speaker 1>the rates that you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a story about like the most</v>

2032
01:21:57.441 --> 01:22:02.441
<v Speaker 1>played song on spotify and how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually generated.</v>

2033
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:06.110
<v Speaker 1>How much would you guess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most played song?</v>

2034
01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking like a Taylor swift kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like that.</v>

2035
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would to be fair,</v>

2036
01:22:10.731 --> 01:22:12.810
<v Speaker 1>if it's that that played on that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2037
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.780
<v Speaker 1>we'd want to make like 1 million bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>off that write something on the alarms,</v>

2038
01:22:17.781 --> 01:22:18.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Or a few hundred thousand thousand 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2040
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:26.120
<v Speaker 1>you would assume 5 cents a pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really valuable thing.</v>

2041
01:22:26.121 --> 01:22:28.900
<v Speaker 1>If you're playing it millions of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times you're</v>

2042
01:22:28.901 --> 01:22:31.010
<v Speaker 1>playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Some Camper van Beethoven said that</v>

2043
01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:33.020
<v Speaker 1>his stuff has been played way more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2044
01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:33.913
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2045
01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.630
<v Speaker 1>purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he's like,</v>

2046
01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come see my shows now.</v>

2047
01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cracker on camera.</v>

2048
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:41.840
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some benefit to it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as exposure.</v>

2049
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not all negative for sure not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But does Taylor swift need that</v>

2050
01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:45.770
<v Speaker 1>exposure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2051
01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.680
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what the UCB did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2052
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:50.930
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to pay you because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be honored.</v>

2053
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.531
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2054
01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:53.480
<v Speaker 1>we're just barely getting by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they opened up two new</v>

2055
01:22:53.481 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 1>locations after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I found out,</v>

2057
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:57.170
<v Speaker 1>those guys don't pay anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2058
01:22:57.171 --> 01:22:59.360
<v Speaker 1>he can soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get your fucking improv troupes.</v>

2059
01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Not Pains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are comedians and they go,</v>

2060
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.920
<v Speaker 1>you should be lucky to perform at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>UCB.</v>

2061
01:23:03.921 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like a showcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2062
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe let's just</v>

2063
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 3>say that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say me as a eight year comic when</v>

2064
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:11.170
<v Speaker 3>I was an eight year comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can get seen there.</v>

2065
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But aren't you the UCB lucky to have</v>

2066
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah Sub Michelle and Zach Alfin acra</v>

2067
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 3>show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not just a straight,</v>

2068
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>we're all lucky to be on spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2069
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2070
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:25.030
<v Speaker 3>They also need the black keys to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay relevant.</v>

2071
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:27.970
<v Speaker 3>If all the top musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyonce and the black keys and arcade</v>

2072
01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 3>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll go,</v>

2073
01:23:28.931 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 3>we're all pulling out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2074
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.943
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it,</v>

2075
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:37.950
<v Speaker 3>keep it evers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's seven black listeners broken now.</v>

2076
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice way to go.</v>

2077
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.881
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2078
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Then they're less of place to go for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

2079
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:47.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree.</v>

2080
01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:49.270
<v Speaker 3>So like just pay fairly</v>

2081
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:51.080
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to find out how much money they</v>

2082
01:23:51.081 --> 01:23:54.020
<v Speaker 4>make and what is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the the most played,</v>

2083
01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.250
<v Speaker 4>the most played song ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just had one that got went over 500</v>

2084
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.960
<v Speaker 4>million song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 million streams,</v>

2085
01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.420
<v Speaker 4>what would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four to $500 million.</v>

2086
01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 4>5 cents B.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you get that much.</v>

2087
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.990
<v Speaker 4>How it works out though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause that just try to figure out the</v>

2088
01:24:05.991 --> 01:24:08.240
<v Speaker 4>math in your head a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say there's 10 bucks a month,</v>

2089
01:24:08.690 --> 01:24:12.500
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a payment for to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>care of the service itself.</v>

2090
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they say that 30% fee goes to</v>

2091
01:24:14.421 --> 01:24:17.990
<v Speaker 4>spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a roughly 70% less than $7</v>

2092
01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:21.530
<v Speaker 4>left out of that 10 so it's a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>math if you like,</v>

2093
01:24:21.531 --> 01:24:26.030
<v Speaker 4>if you play a song one song or if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to only Ari Shaffir 10 times a</v>

2094
01:24:26.031 --> 01:24:27.680
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 days a month,</v>

2095
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.760
<v Speaker 4>you would technically get all of my $7</v>
<v Speaker 4>technically.</v>

2096
01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:35.510
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't necessarily work out that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way because if I played one joe Rogan</v>

2097
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:36.860
<v Speaker 4>Song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get a little piece of that</v>

2098
01:24:36.861 --> 01:24:39.020
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But not everyone just listens to one</v>

2099
01:24:39.021 --> 01:24:42.200
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you listened to 25 songs a day or in</v>

2100
01:24:42.201 --> 01:24:43.420
<v Speaker 4>an end?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In one hour even.</v>

2101
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of time people just let it</v>

2102
01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:47.600
<v Speaker 4>play and the they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's like one set some things up</v>

2103
01:24:47.601 --> 01:24:50.660
<v Speaker 4>like that where they've tried to game</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system where they've tried to play</v>

2104
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:53.810
<v Speaker 4>someone song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new artist multiple times to try to</v>

2105
01:24:53.811 --> 01:24:55.230
<v Speaker 4>get them some money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

2106
01:24:55.231 --> 01:24:58.280
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't necessarily work out totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>well for them that way either,</v>

2107
01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's just not a lot of money in</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in general.</v>

2108
01:25:01.341 --> 01:25:03.220
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of sales for,</v>

2109
01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:06.290
<v Speaker 4>for music and a total,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just have a big band.</v>

2110
01:25:06.291 --> 01:25:09.350
<v Speaker 4>I liked the def tones that they have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>new album coming out soon.</v>

2111
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.160
<v Speaker 4>It just announced a concert in La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you buy a ticket to this show,</v>

2112
01:25:13.161 --> 01:25:16.910
<v Speaker 4>you get their album for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Deftones um,</v>

2113
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:19.710
<v Speaker 4>they've been out for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This show you at the outfit.</v>

2114
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.830
<v Speaker 4>That's an arcade fire did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like when the show is touring for</v>

2115
01:25:21.831 --> 01:25:23.480
<v Speaker 4>the books,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to get the album anyway.</v>

2116
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be able listen to all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>songs on Youtube,</v>

2117
01:25:26.391 --> 01:25:28.010
<v Speaker 4>on spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pandora.</v>

2118
01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.590
<v Speaker 4>They've been around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty bad ass.</v>

2119
01:25:30.591 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 4>They had some bad ass songs.</v>

2120
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Could you tell me</v>
<v Speaker 3>five senses but it's not,</v>

2121
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I can't fucking figure this calculator</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it works though.</v>

2122
01:25:38.031 --> 01:25:39.950
<v Speaker 3>What he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to know what it would be on</v>

2123
01:25:39.951 --> 01:25:42.940
<v Speaker 3>radio plays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at you.</v>

2124
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 3>The most downloaded song,</v>

2125
01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.140
<v Speaker 4>well that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the Ed Sheeran Song like</v>

2126
01:25:48.141 --> 01:25:49.520
<v Speaker 4>thinking out loud I think is what it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>called.</v>

2127
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:52.490
<v Speaker 4>500 million in the article compared it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a youtube would.</v>

2128
01:25:52.491 --> 01:25:55.340
<v Speaker 4>They have over 10 songs that have over a</v>
<v Speaker 4>billion plays on it.</v>

2129
01:25:55.341 --> 01:25:58.860
<v Speaker 4>How much youtube gets money because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's ads next testing.</v>

2130
01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:03.230
<v Speaker 4>So they're getting money from the ads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not from people using the service from a</v>

2131
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:04.200
<v Speaker 4>subscriber and they've started</v>

2132
01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:06.220
<v Speaker 1>youtube red to try to compete with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing too,</v>

2133
01:26:06.221 --> 01:26:10.250
<v Speaker 1>which is nine nine nine a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Service thing like that too.</v>

2134
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's really probably not that much</v>

2135
01:26:15.561 --> 01:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>money that's even left over for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists out of that $7 kind of their</v>

2136
01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:23.900
<v Speaker 1>argument and that people are just a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money in and around in general for</v>

2137
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2138
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 1>but don't they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it called,</v>

2139
01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:29.300
<v Speaker 1>an IPO initial public offering that</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't they do,</v>

2140
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they do stuff like that with these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of companies and they sell them and then</v>

2141
01:26:31.731 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2142
01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.320
<v Speaker 1>sector gobbles them up and the stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>

2143
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 1>they make a of degree and already by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2144
01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2145
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Multiple ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm trying to say there's</v>

2146
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 1>deals you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a spotify or apple music could</v>

2147
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:46.430
<v Speaker 1>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2148
01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 1>drake for his new album to come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively on apple music.</v>

2149
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way you can get it.</v>

2150
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what Kanya is sorta tried to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with title right now.</v>

2151
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Exclusively exclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like we have it.</v>

2152
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 1>No one else has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2153
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2154
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>if I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the only way I can get this new</v>

2155
01:27:00.831 --> 01:27:02.780
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get Amazon prime or I've got to</v>

2156
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 1>get apple play or I got to get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that because everyone has</v>

2157
01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 1>their own gaming system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks when it only comes out only on</v>

2158
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.373
<v Speaker 1>xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2159
01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

2160
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to fucking buy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>playstation.</v>

2161
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>We already have an x box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that use android phones,</v>

2162
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:20.150
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Louis unbox therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was telling me that he avoids using</v>

2163
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 1>itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having this conversation.</v>

2164
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I was asking him about phones today</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there was a threat of my message</v>

2165
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:29.660
<v Speaker 1>board where people getting mad at Brian</v>
<v Speaker 1>for talking shit about the Samsung</v>

2166
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Galaxy s seven and that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>switch over to it,</v>

2167
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but I know he switches over to different</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones like every couple of months and</v>

2168
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:36.800
<v Speaker 1>write stories about this Guy Louis.</v>

2169
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbox therapy's a website where he said</v>

2170
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you got a youtube channel on a website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he does is he,</v>

2171
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 1>he reviews tech stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes it out of the box and tries it</v>

2172
01:27:45.681 --> 01:27:48.380
<v Speaker 1>and he talks about it and he knows a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit about technology.</v>

2173
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 1>He describes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinks he's describing it from a</v>

2174
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.750
<v Speaker 1>very educated point of view and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that phone.</v>

2175
01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:53.420
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2176
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use this as my main phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like a month or something like that.</v>

2177
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.120
<v Speaker 1>That's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>

2178
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what's annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>

2180
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And he said he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he uses like Mac computers,</v>

2181
01:28:04.551 --> 01:28:08.000
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't use itunes because itunes</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific to one platform and that's</v>

2182
01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 1>annoying specific warren platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2183
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you can't get itunes like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like if you want to use like,</v>

2184
01:28:13.281 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you want to watch movies and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2185
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can necessarily do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that on a,</v>

2186
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.500
<v Speaker 1>on an android phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2187
01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:21.420
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I tweet my podcast or she first got</v>

2188
01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>to tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2189
01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

2190
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>don't give me the itunes link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't use that.</v>

2191
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to android.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like 55% of the downloads use</v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes,</v>

2193
01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but 45% don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

2194
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:34.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2195
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I see the most important one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't mean it's the only one.</v>

2196
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to use the other 30% of</v>

2197
01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:43.640
<v Speaker 1>your income to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you sell an album for 10 bucks,</v>

2198
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:46.580
<v Speaker 1>itunes gets $3 of that rubber that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>

2199
01:28:46.581 --> 01:28:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

2200
01:28:48.111 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in like music and sales and stuff.</v>

2201
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And record sales.</v>

2202
01:28:51.711 --> 01:28:52.544
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2203
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do provide that same sort of</v>

2204
01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like if they take 30% it's</v>

2205
01:28:56.961 --> 01:28:58.850
<v Speaker 1>probably similar to how spotify is</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2206
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:01.130
<v Speaker 1>They take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're providing a distribution</v>

2207
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 1>labrador down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping it up and it's a secure,</v>

2208
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:09.990
<v Speaker 1>stable platform that like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>application that comes with your iphone,</v>

2209
01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get any better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2210
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I've had a podcast apps spotify as free</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

2211
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to listen to an ad.</v>

2212
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:19.710
<v Speaker 1>So then they get ad revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2213
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 1>go ahead David ad revenue and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could also subscribe if you like get rid</v>

2214
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:26.620
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get rid of the ads that we can</v>

2215
01:29:26.621 --> 01:29:29.670
<v Speaker 1>still make money off you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to get the ads every 10</v>

2216
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apple does that now too.</v>

2217
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 1>They have a streaming music site</v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

2218
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So what Louis was saying is he uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon prime and Google play because</v>

2219
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:42.220
<v Speaker 1>they're not platform specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2220
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.880
<v Speaker 1>use tweeted a link to a new song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grimes or something.</v>

2221
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who put the apple play one on</v>

2222
01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:50.220
<v Speaker 1>the go click on it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I have to pay for apple play to</v>

2223
01:29:50.221 --> 01:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>play it.</v>

2224
01:29:50.890 --> 01:29:51.723
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2225
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>

2227
01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Like when you go to a website to read an</v>
<v Speaker 1>article and they say they need your</v>

2228
01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 1>email address first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:13.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just a spam filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2236
01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Well just for like a website that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck about.</v>

2237

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An email address that you just,</v>

2239
01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:24.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2240
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the future is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2241
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 1>getting people to pay for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's super hard to get people to</v>

2242
01:30:30.391 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 1>pay for shipping for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2243
01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:32.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the online,</v>

2244
01:30:32.161 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Aubrey about this a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago and if you're a store</v>

2245
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:36.511
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2246
01:30:36.511 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and you were buying two shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2247
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in line right there.</v>

2248
01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you were at starbucks yesterday and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see these,</v>

2249
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2250
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 1>the pad chargers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much did it like 10 bucks.</v>

2251
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:45.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2252
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:46.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2253
01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:49.110
<v Speaker 1>You already got your Wallet Open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually more than we were</v>

2254
01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.480
<v Speaker 1>spending on coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't buy it.</v>

2255
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 1>You didn't buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be the biggest deal if</v>

2256
01:30:53.401 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad example.</v>

2257
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:55.801
<v Speaker 1>But if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2258
01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:57.060
<v Speaker 1>would you also like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm socks up.</v>

2259
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:57.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2260
01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll get some socks too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to open up your wallet is like a way</v>

2261
01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:04.080
<v Speaker 1>bigger deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a 99 cent APP.</v>

2262
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:04.801
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2263
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:06.960
<v Speaker 1>let me read the reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2264
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 1>let me look at this as a good app.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

2265
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:14.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like strange though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For $1 is you're way less likely to</v>

2266
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:15.030
<v Speaker 1>spend it online.</v>

2267
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Then 10 bucks in a store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just hard to get people to actually</v>

2268
01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:20.360
<v Speaker 1>open up that eat wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wall at either.</v>

2273
01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times you're just entering in</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the individual credit card</v>

2274
01:31:29.791 --> 01:31:32.160
<v Speaker 1>information every time.</v>

2303
01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some things about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

2305
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.300
<v Speaker 1>when you use it to pay for everything at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney.</v>

2306
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So we don't take your wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All transactions.</v>

2307
01:32:33.221 --> 01:32:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's getting on your rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your fast pass or fail.</v>

2308
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2309
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 1>The technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard this coming.</v>

2310
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I bleed into some other places too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2311
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 1>He just got to set up a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for you too.</v>

2312
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the reasons why we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>resisting this Apple Watch thing.</v>

2313
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:50.530
<v Speaker 1>That red ban has a chimes off every</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

2314
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't figure it out when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>send them text message with chime and</v>

2315
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:55.870
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't figure out how to shut it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2316
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.400
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2317
01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 1>that means it's hard to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's bad.</v>

2318
01:32:59.120 --> 01:32:59.953
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2319
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it shut off?</v>

2320
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my fucking,</v>

2321
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:04.450
<v Speaker 1>because that's where it's going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2322
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And then that thing's going to be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy things and then someone's going</v>

2323
01:33:07.191 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 1>to come stand next to you and steal all</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking credit card information off</v>

2324
01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 1>your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already know how to do that.</v>

2325
01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:15.000
<v Speaker 1>This is already a way well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't work with Arash fear,</v>

2326
01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:16.300
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

2327
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Cause ours you fear has off flip phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told it to burb what's we're having</v>

2328
01:33:20.171 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 1>this conversation it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2330
01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:22.750

2331
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:25.950
<v Speaker 1>That dick tie it at the new ones don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you the cancer,</v>

2332
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.030
<v Speaker 1>that deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's correct.</v>

2333
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably exactly the same</v>

2334
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:31.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2335
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 1>you've shown us that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2336
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 1>the Disney magic band is what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called.</v>

2337
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2338
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a fitbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

2339
01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.200
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:42.120
<v Speaker 1>But there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of extra things in it.</v>

2341
01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:44.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not just unlocked the door of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel room.</v>

2342
01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such your key for your car.</v>

2344
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.820
<v Speaker 1>The thought about that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said,</v>

2346
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:56.020

<v Speaker 1>room is unless you're going to go up and</v>

2347
01:33:56.021 --> 01:34:01.021

<v Speaker 1>tried the key,</v>

2349
01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.680

<v Speaker 1>and then it's just some guys staring at</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's happened to me before.</v>

2355
01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:17.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2356
01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

2357
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 1>so they want you to put your podcast on</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify.</v>

2358
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have podcasts on there now and I've</v>

2359
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.240
<v Speaker 1>resisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2360
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know if it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're a precedent set or at some</v>

2361
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

2362
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

2363
01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess more people who are able to have</v>

2364
01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:39.160
<v Speaker 1>access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

2365
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Do they edit it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they put ads in it?</v>

2366
01:34:40.991 --> 01:34:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are expanding.</v>

2367
01:34:43.441 --> 01:34:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Are there some uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you can watch on there and there's</v>

2368
01:34:46.241 --> 01:34:49.330
<v Speaker 1>this one video aspect coming through</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2369
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I liked that fact that it's available as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular MP three and you can do</v>

2370
01:34:53.951 --> 01:34:55.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2371
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 1>You could watch it while it's live on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

2372
01:34:58.170 --> 01:35:00.320
<v Speaker 1>can watch it later or you can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>download it.</v>

2373
01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to download through</v>
<v Speaker 1>itunes,</v>

2374
01:35:01.791 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to download it through</v>

2375
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:05.690
<v Speaker 1>spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a different thing</v>

2376
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.910
<v Speaker 1>because that's like a service that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a new,</v>

2377
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2378
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:10.000
<v Speaker 1>then you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2379
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you're selling content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a content provider,</v>

2380
01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.753
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spotify.</v>

2381
01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're content providers,</v>

2382
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:18.800
<v Speaker 1>but they don't create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not content creators.</v>

2383
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They probably will have actually like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>

2384
01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe things like,</v>

2385
01:35:24.190 --> 01:35:26.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anyone could just get all the,</v>

2386
01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have to do something.</v>

2387
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is constantly stepped up</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

2388
01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean from drop shipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2389
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cd videos,</v>

2390
01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:37.430

<v Speaker 1>Streaming.</v>

2392
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go,</v>

2393
01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:40.930
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

<v Speaker 1>downloading stuff too much.</v>

01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:35.380
<v Speaker 1>It's up to them with the readiness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to put it out.</v>

2421
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:36.141
<v Speaker 1>They want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2422
01:36:36.141 --> 01:36:37.580
<v Speaker 1>be careful of this or they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you.</v>

2423
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's see herself figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck it was when this happened.</v>

2427
01:36:51.861 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 1>15 was that a 15 story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think stop.</v>

2428
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.610
<v Speaker 1>We can't do this anymore by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in Tempe,</v>

2429
01:36:58.611 --> 01:37:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Arizona this Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>

2430
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doppler radar.</v>

2431
01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I like cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tempe,</v>

2432
01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The home of my first Netflix special.</v>

2433
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I recorded that there in 2005 really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2434
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.890
<v Speaker 1>The one where I talked about how stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush was.</v>

2435
01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep playing that now with this</v>

2436
01:37:16.491 --> 01:37:20.720
<v Speaker 1>election because I said you know that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think what happened like after he got</v>

2437
01:37:20.721 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 1>elected a second time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were probably sitting in the back</v>

2438
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 1>of the room going we can think we go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2439
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah I remember that pet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I remember that bit.</v>

2440
01:37:27.230 --> 01:37:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And then boom cause it was a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job of</v>

2441
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.400
<v Speaker 1>like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you this before,</v>

2442
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but using your voice the way you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that bit was like,</v>

2443
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it was like four years past and they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>look and they go wait.</v>

2444
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like that quiet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pause mixed by quiet instead of just</v>

2445
01:37:46.941 --> 01:37:49.700
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can flex up and down at flection.</v>

2446
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 1>You're just really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>

2447
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I just put myself in the position of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually happening.</v>

2448
01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what I try to like what would it</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like if there really was this cabal</v>

2449
01:37:57.991 --> 01:38:02.991
<v Speaker 1>of evil billionaires that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the mindset in program the</v>

2450
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:06.900
<v Speaker 1>entire country and they wanted to put a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb person office so they could figure</v>

2451
01:38:06.901 --> 01:38:08.010
<v Speaker 1>out how dumb people were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2452
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:09.110
<v Speaker 1>that was the premise of the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:38:09.111 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid people are.</v>

2454
01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can watch the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see what movies they buy.</v>

2455
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:17.040
<v Speaker 1>But the only real way is to put a dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in as president and see if</v>

2456
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:18.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Because if they don't freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're dumber than him.</v>

2458
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know he's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2459
01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:26.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing about being really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid.</v>

2460
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 1>So the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premise of the bit was the only way</v>

2462
01:38:29.941 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 1>we could really find out how stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>America was was to put a really dumb guy</v>

2463
01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 1>in as president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's many,</v>

2464
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:39.470
<v Speaker 1>many really articulate whip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart Republican candidates that could</v>

2465
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.010
<v Speaker 1>easily make a great leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2466
01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they do that?</v>

2467
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:44.350
<v Speaker 1>They can't find how stupid we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we do that,</v>

2468
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a backup plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can get the dummy in</v>

2469
01:38:46.891 --> 01:38:49.830
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after he won a second term,</v>

2470
01:38:49.831 --> 01:38:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that's when the bit was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can go down there.</v>

2471
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.520
<v Speaker 1>So now they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2472
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they're using that to illustrate Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump or something.</v>

2473
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Band.</v>

2474
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 1>They've made too many comparisons to</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidates.</v>

2475
01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:01.920
<v Speaker 1>The Hitler that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

2476
01:39:01.921 --> 01:39:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it does your to kicking doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said Bush was Hitler.</v>

2477
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like look enough,</v>

2478
01:39:07.111 --> 01:39:09.990
<v Speaker 1>like the hat comedy premise from hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>from hell.</v>

2479
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 1>She's like the strip are from how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at some point it's like,</v>

2480
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:15.540
<v Speaker 1>well hell doesn't seem that bad to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

2481
01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:20.541
<v Speaker 1>You're overusing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a really easy way to get away</v>

2482
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 1>with like saying something's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for a long time.</v>

2483
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Like in the 80s in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a knockout punch.</v>

2484
01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:32.610
<v Speaker 1>The something from hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he's saying how people</v>

2486
01:39:32.611 --> 01:39:33.990
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2487
01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audrey,</v>

2488
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 1>push on steroids</v>
<v Speaker 1>on crack.</v>

2489
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Crack is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2490
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the same thing,</v>

2491
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 1>but say it slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like we're original,</v>

2492
01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2493
01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still on in one word.</v>

2494
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2495
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's just a very minor part of what</v>

2496
01:39:54.091 --> 01:39:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's fine to use it as a non</v>

2497
01:39:56.971 --> 01:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>creative narrative or noncreative a</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptive,</v>

2498
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 1>but when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing it a lot,</v>

2499
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I think too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>overuse.</v>

2500
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much this is going to</v>

2501
01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>change everything the way Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>is running for president.</v>

2502
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I saw from it.</v>

2503
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 1>So before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2504
01:40:19.741 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming in the Lincoln Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2505
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 1>they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the candidates would just say their</v>

2506
01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:24.384
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they,</v>

2507
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:26.910
<v Speaker 1>what they thought and that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper print and that'd be the end of</v>

2508
01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go out and talk for hours</v>

2509
01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:28.920
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2510
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.090
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stomping him,</v>

2511
01:40:30.091 --> 01:40:30.851
<v Speaker 1>do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2512
01:40:30.851 --> 01:40:32.700
<v Speaker 1>no microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No microphones.</v>

2513
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:33.451
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2514
01:40:33.451 --> 01:40:35.550
<v Speaker 1>No microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get up there and talk.</v>

2515
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully the acoustics aren't terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly it's probably outside.</v>

2516
01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.500
<v Speaker 1>People Fart and take a train to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>state to try to convince them.</v>

2517
01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:47.160
<v Speaker 1>By the time your speech has done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the people are dead for malaria,</v>

2518
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.790
<v Speaker 1>they just die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it became a thing where like</v>

2519
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton went on Arsenio Hall and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>played</v>

2520
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 2>a trumpet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trumpet,</v>

2521
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:56.620
<v Speaker 2>saxophone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

2522
01:40:56.770 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>And his ratings went up like 10 points</v>
<v Speaker 2>over night and we're like,</v>

2523
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:02.320
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has nothing to do with the issues.</v>

2524
01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And so there was this mixture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>showmanship and issues and I think</v>

2525
01:41:07.181 --> 01:41:10.090
<v Speaker 2>trump's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his thesis is guys,</v>

2526
01:41:10.091 --> 01:41:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the your platform matters</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as the showmanship.</v>

2527
01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's only showmanship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well also it's who else is running.</v>

2528
01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Ted Cruz,</v>

2529
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 2>have you seen those videos?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz made?</v>

2530
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commercials when they show the</v>

2531
01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:24.950
<v Speaker 2>outtakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

2532
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:27.700
<v Speaker 2>all the people hugging and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the best is the wife,</v>

2533
01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom going like,</v>

2534
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:32.060
<v Speaker 2>she prays for me and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mm hmm.</v>

2535
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:33.250
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

2536
01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>

2537
01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:39.030
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I don't like the look of like of</v>

2538
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.341
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

2539
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:40.390
<v Speaker 2>where are you going with us a day?</v>

2540
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Just got cut mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom,</v>

2541
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:47.320
<v Speaker 2>stick to the script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shape or pious and I'm not gay.</v>

2542
01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2543
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 2>the old thing is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

2544
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I think Bernie's the only one talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about shit that actually American people</v>

2545
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 2>day to day have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely talking more about</v>

2546
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:05.980
<v Speaker 2>social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I would like to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say socialism,</v>

2548
01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:10.900
<v Speaker 2>like it's a bad word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just social issues.</v>

2549
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2550
01:42:12.671 --> 01:42:17.671
<v Speaker 2>but socialism isn't just social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Socialism implies some sort of a</v>

2551
01:42:17.801 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 2>community pot of money that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to distribute to people.</v>

2552
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Do they distributors that now and we use</v>
<v Speaker 2>80% of it for defense?</v>

2553
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that's just all offense.</v>

2554
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:28.930
<v Speaker 2>But that's the problem that people find</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>

2555
01:42:28.931 --> 01:42:31.240
<v Speaker 2>The big problem that I've heard from</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that actually understand it,</v>

2556
01:42:31.241 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>not folks like you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that actually understand it,</v>

2557
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.980
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is it just makes government</v>

2558
01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:39.640
<v Speaker 2>bigger because what he's doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposing that we get more taxes from</v>

2559
01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:42.530
<v Speaker 2>people and somehow or another it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create more programs and that there's</v>

2560
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:44.200
<v Speaker 2>more programs going to trickle down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people.</v>

2561
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is here's what I</v>

2562
01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:48.320
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you take more taxes from people and</v>

2563
01:42:48.321 --> 01:42:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you're just giving it to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have to be competent.</v>

2564
01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:52.780
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden you're never been</v>
<v Speaker 2>competent before.</v>

2565
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a Co somebody on my message</v>

2566
01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>board brought this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Department of fish and game</v>

2567
01:42:56.711 --> 01:43:00.010
<v Speaker 2>that I always praise them for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation efforts that they've done.</v>

2568
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.760
<v Speaker 2>They've got all big wildlife biologists</v>
<v Speaker 2>running it.</v>

2569
01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:04.631
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2570
01:43:04.631 --> 01:43:07.240
<v Speaker 2>like these are like actual scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a writer.</v>

2571
01:43:07.241 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Ocracy they hired some really smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>people care about the environment to run</v>

2572
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 2>these fish and wildlife department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say people say like that would</v>

2573
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:17.140
<v Speaker 2>never work and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2574
01:43:17.141 --> 01:43:19.060
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like how's it has no,</v>

2575
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.350
<v Speaker 2>but here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the reality.</v>

2576
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.070
<v Speaker 2>What we have now is not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are getting poorer and poorer.</v>

2577
01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:26.380
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife biologists are very different</v>

2578
01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:27.214
<v Speaker 2>than economist.</v>

2579
01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you get a wildlife biologist,</v>

2580
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:32.560
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to manage the buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>population and they try to figure out,</v>

2581
01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:33.701
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2582
01:43:33.701 --> 01:43:35.860
<v Speaker 2>we've got wolves in yellowstone that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing the buffalo.</v>

2583
01:43:35.861 --> 01:43:38.530
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they try to find work arounds.</v>

2584
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>They do all sorts of different things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to maintain healthy populations.</v>

2585
01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 2>There's no profit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So profit.</v>

2586
01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See now the problem with anything</v>

2587
01:43:45.941 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 2>economic is there's all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating factors that lead up to rules</v>

2588
01:43:50.651 --> 01:43:55.651
<v Speaker 2>that get past that allow these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that become president or become,</v>

2589
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:57.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they're doing,</v>

2590
01:43:57.321 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 2>where they're making deals with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the bankers that are paying Hillary</v>

2591
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Clinton $250,000 they get them into</v>
<v Speaker 2>these positions and then they can,</v>

2592
01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:07.370
<v Speaker 2>they can profit insanely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get these positions on these,</v>

2593
01:44:07.371 --> 01:44:09.230
<v Speaker 2>these guys go from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a great,</v>

2594
01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a great documentary called inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>job and it's all about the Wall Street</v>

2595
01:44:13.341 --> 01:44:18.341
<v Speaker 2>collapse and this guy who was like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>very educated financial guy is</v>

2596
01:44:19.041 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>interviewing these people and picking</v>
<v Speaker 2>them apart as he's interviewing them and</v>

2597
01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to panic and they start to</v>

2598
01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 2>freak out and some of them go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2599
01:44:26.091 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to only have one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

2600
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm going to leave in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the interview of they're all smiles</v>

2601
01:44:30.381 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and happy and these are economists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he finds out that these guys who were</v>

2602
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:38.060
<v Speaker 2>economy professors went on to get jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these banks.</v>

2603
01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So they set these rules like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we've chest checked with the,</v>

2604
01:44:41.631 --> 01:44:44.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah University economics</v>

2605
01:44:44.271 --> 01:44:46.420
<v Speaker 2>department and they recommend this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that.</v>

2606
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:51.500
<v Speaker 2>So they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they move into cushy jobs where they get</v>

2607
01:44:51.501 --> 01:44:53.750
<v Speaker 2>paid millions of dollars once they</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>

2608
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:56.390
<v Speaker 2>These government positions are these</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching positions?</v>

2609
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fascinating stuff.</v>

2610
01:44:58.941 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Cause it shows there's motivation and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as there's motivation for profit,</v>

2611
01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:06.290
<v Speaker 2>everything gets girly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Clinton can say all day and have some</v>

2612
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:06.831
<v Speaker 2>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2613
01:45:06.831 --> 01:45:09.050
<v Speaker 2>well I'll try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton can say all day that she has,</v>

2614
01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:13.520
<v Speaker 2>they don't influence her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then they don't take on nature.</v>

2615
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't take that much money to talk.</v>

2616
01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:15.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2617
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know it's like I don't,</v>

2618
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.250
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither one of us really understand it,</v>

2619
01:45:19.251 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see Bernie as a guy was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2620
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:23.100
<v Speaker 2>let's just do our morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it'll work out well.</v>

2621
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not about impression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about,</v>

2622
01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:26.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not bad for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to,</v>

2623
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:30.090
<v Speaker 2>not that I would like Mrs. Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Talos,</v>

2624
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:35.950
<v Speaker 2>what are those transcripts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they have that work thought</v>

2625
01:45:36.201 --> 01:45:37.400
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

2626
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:40.610
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have a lot of money like that,</v>

2627
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:44.300
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's paying you to talk for an</v>

2628
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is absurd.</v>

2629
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:48.050
<v Speaker 2>That's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2630
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 2>And they have transcripts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it won't show up.</v>

2631
01:45:51.981 --> 01:45:53.630
<v Speaker 2>She won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she won't release them.</v>

2632
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is very bizarre shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2633
01:45:56.031 --> 01:45:57.830
<v Speaker 2>That's her normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hides her email.</v>

2634
01:45:57.831 --> 01:45:58.431
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck else is there?</v>

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 1>That's it on the democratic side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't heard a peep of anybody else</v>

2664

<v Speaker 1>It's just them.</v>

2667
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where</v>

2668
01:47:16.501 --> 01:47:18.450
<v Speaker 1>everybody's shutting the fuck up because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they have to.</v>

2669
01:47:18.451 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 1>This is the last gasps of a dying</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2670
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:27.110
<v Speaker 1>This is the last gasps of a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying system that is set up because it</v>

2671
01:47:27.981 --> 01:47:30.330
<v Speaker 1>was back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system is fighting back then was set</v>

2672
01:47:30.331 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 1>up back when people wrote with feathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slinger when we had congress,</v>

2673
01:47:33.241 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't afford to travel from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nashville all the way up to Washington.</v>

2674
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.360
<v Speaker 1>So we have our congress goes for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they speak for us,</v>

2675
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:43.141
<v Speaker 1>so we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

2676
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:45.890
<v Speaker 1>we have email and phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need you to go there for and</v>

2677
01:47:45.891 --> 01:47:48.180
<v Speaker 1>why do you have a job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be restructured.</v>

2678
01:47:48.181 --> 01:47:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Restructured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2679
01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Well it needs to be restructured to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>from scratch.</v>

2680
01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The technology at the technology and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to people that's available today</v>

2681
01:47:56.701 --> 01:48:01.560
<v Speaker 1>because government should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should have to have some level of</v>

2682
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 1>education to understand the parameters</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what they're talking about,</v>

2683
01:48:05.791 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 1>what they're voting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2684
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:08.970
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not even getting the information</v>

2685
01:48:09.010 --> 01:48:10.710
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much waste.</v>

2686
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.240
<v Speaker 1>We are government has got a virus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not being cured.</v>

2687
01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to these guys who were defense</v>

2688
01:48:17.371 --> 01:48:21.390
<v Speaker 1>contracts work for defense contractors</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of them</v>

2689
01:48:21.391 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 1>had been in the military before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both been with the military when</v>

2690
01:48:24.241 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 1>they didn't a pinch pinto cartridge.</v>

2691
01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:29.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't order petro cartridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They order a new printer,</v>

2692
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 1>take out the printer cartridge and shred</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new printer.</v>

2693
01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.473
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2694
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and there's no repercussions for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no one has to be like,</v>

2695
01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:38.300
<v Speaker 1>did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2696
01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:41.990
<v Speaker 1>it's easier or to order it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I,</v>

2697
01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:43.260
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2698
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The these guys high as fuck when they're</v>

01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:51.540
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go on a podcast to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this too high to remember the</v>

2702
01:48:51.541 --> 01:48:53.730
<v Speaker 1>specific details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of them and it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just corrupted and the governments</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he just won't talk about the drone</v>
<v Speaker 1>strikes about wedding parties in Yemen</v>

2708
01:49:06.361 --> 01:49:09.570
<v Speaker 1>where we're not even at war with just</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing random people.</v>

2709
01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And our official quote is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just not talk about it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's more drones now.</v>

2716
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.960
<v Speaker 1>They're way better too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still killing innocence and</v>

2717
01:49:24.961 --> 01:49:27.090
<v Speaker 1>we're just not talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2722
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:39.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they still do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they used to shoot like we're a</v>

2723
01:49:39.431 --> 01:49:41.100
<v Speaker 1>phone is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2724
01:49:41.101 --> 01:49:43.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a real bad guy and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out in an apartment building and</v>

2725
01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:45.700
<v Speaker 1>your phone happens to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're shooting at.</v>

2726
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting missiles at that phone hoping</v>

2727
01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:49.680
<v Speaker 1>somebody else has the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>

2728
01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.390
<v Speaker 1>it's acceptable casualties at the phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bedroom.</v>

2729
01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took that bedroom out.</v>

2730
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:54.810
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Americans,</v>

2731
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't do that because we value</v>
<v Speaker 1>American lives.</v>

2732
01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Are innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives over innocent.</v>

2733
01:49:59.170 --> 01:50:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get many lives.</v>

2734
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just way more convenient when they</v>

2735
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 1>don't look like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't talk like us and they dress</v>

2736
01:50:05.711 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way more convenient to light them</v>

2737
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:09.210
<v Speaker 1>up with rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>

2738
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British were smart when they</v>

2739
01:50:10.811 --> 01:50:13.240
<v Speaker 1>colonized Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2740
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>they put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2741
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 1>east Indian people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians from,</v>

2742
01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:18.190
<v Speaker 1>from India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put them in charge.</v>

2743
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So the Africans hated the oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hated people who,</v>

2744
01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated him,</v>

2745
01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>conquered them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one likes people.</v>

2746
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:26.120
<v Speaker 1>No one likes being conquered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a thing.</v>

2747
01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Went to a couple of girls that ran in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2748
01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 1>and so they're like their face of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate it with these Indians who also</v>

2749
01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.250
<v Speaker 1>had been conquered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move over there.</v>

2750
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's really no terrorism on</v>

2751
01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:41.041
<v Speaker 1>British soil from the African Milton's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't hate that white face.</v>

2752
01:50:42.730 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Well if we went to war with say Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2753
01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they look just like just like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is harder.</v>

2754
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily they were coats.</v>

2755
01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'd find out that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government's photoshopping their faces</v>

2756
01:50:56.681 --> 01:51:01.540
<v Speaker 1>and stretching them out to make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>look more like look at those oval heads.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2769
01:51:28.630 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 1>he takes unbelievable amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment is what he looks like.</v>

2770
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.380
<v Speaker 1>But look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2771
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:36.430
<v Speaker 1>he looks just foreign enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>

2772
01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some Asian in him.</v>

2773
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a Russia,</v>

2774
01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got Mongolian in Mongolia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably why he's such a fucking</v>

2775
01:51:42.131 --> 01:51:44.890
<v Speaker 1>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably descendant of Ganga Iskcon</v>

2776
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 1>or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2777
01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2778
01:51:47.501 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2779
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.330
<v Speaker 1>the Mongols conquered Russia for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years.</v>

2780
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:58.920
<v Speaker 1>The Mongols came in in the winter in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and unexpectedly and fucking took</v>

2782
01:51:59.651 --> 01:52:00.760
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like toby,</v>

2783
01:52:00.761 --> 01:52:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the front bar tender a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:07.300
<v Speaker 1>That's funny as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's an animal man.</v>

2785
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:09.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

2786
01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fun to watch.</v>

2787
01:52:10.361 --> 01:52:12.760
<v Speaker 1>He's super aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about this rematch.</v>

2788
01:52:13.210 --> 01:52:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz and conor Mcgregor.</v>

2789
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:17.800
<v Speaker 1>What are they fighting at 55?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

2790
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's been solidified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that connor is asked for it to</v>

2791
01:52:20.951 --> 01:52:22.750
<v Speaker 1>take place at 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where he was,</v>

2792
01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but he can say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this exactly the same way and</v>

2793
01:52:26.411 --> 01:52:27.820
<v Speaker 1>then it won't be a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2794
01:52:27.821 --> 01:52:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But also I think he was really healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one 70 and I think you'd like it was</v>

2795
01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:34.300
<v Speaker 1>connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think you felt great leading up to</v>

2796
01:52:34.301 --> 01:52:38.500
<v Speaker 1>the camp and leading up to the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had a bad game plan and his</v>

2797
01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:42.540
<v Speaker 1>ground Game Kinda got exposed to weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes above where you want to tie two</v>

2798
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 1>weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

2799
01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both weighed in almost exactly</v>

2800
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No two way classes above where he won</v>

2801
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:49.490
<v Speaker 2>his title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2802
01:52:49.491 --> 01:52:52.310
<v Speaker 2>But not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All it is is they're not cutting weight.</v>

2803
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not whiting.</v>

2804
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not fighting like Damien Maia</v>

2805
01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:02.220
<v Speaker 2>who used to fight at two oh five or one</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 and he's cutting down title shot and</v>

2806
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>listen that title shots where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't deserve title shot on two</v>

2807
01:53:04.761 --> 01:53:06.830
<v Speaker 2>weight classes above you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a nate diaz fight.</v>

2808
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Well this isn't a title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying at least.</v>

2809
01:53:08.981 --> 01:53:09.711
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2810
01:53:09.711 --> 01:53:13.730
<v Speaker 2>you know the whole story behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a fallout Hofeld dos Anjos is</v>

2811
01:53:13.731 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 2>the lightweight champion was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be fighting conor mcgregor.</v>

2812
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:18.140
<v Speaker 2>He breaks his foot 11 days before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2813
01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz takes the fight on a drop of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hat.</v>

2814
01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:23.840
<v Speaker 2>No training whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking none.</v>

2815
01:53:23.970 --> 01:53:25.850
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was at the store.</v>

2816
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hanging,</v>

2817
01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:28.520
<v Speaker 2>hanging out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate,</v>

2818
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:30.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posted pictures afterwards of him</v>

2819
01:53:30.321 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 2>drinking Tequila and hanging out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico eating tacos and shit.</v>

2820
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.620
<v Speaker 2>So he was just having a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine bitch.</v>

2821
01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 2>He's just living his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2822
01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>But he's in such good shape that he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with that because he does so</v>

2823
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:44.510
<v Speaker 2>much triathlon training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly biking and swimming and</v>

2824
01:53:44.511 --> 01:53:47.060
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He entered into a bunch of triathlons.</v>

2825
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:50.840
<v Speaker 2>He's in very good shape and so he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to pull it off cause his cardio</v>

2826
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 2>base was so good and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking damn good fighter.</v>

2827
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:58.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a damn good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he signed too and he's fought</v>

2828
01:53:58.551 --> 01:54:01.160
<v Speaker 2>legitimately at one 70 twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost,</v>

2829
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 2>he lost a stun gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim.</v>

2830
01:54:02.841 --> 01:54:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And he also lost a Roy McDonald at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 these are the legitimate one.</v>

2831
01:54:06.591 --> 01:54:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Seventies and Roy being one of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

2832
01:54:08.530 --> 01:54:09.500
<v Speaker 2>70 world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2833
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:13.640
<v Speaker 2>he got ragdolled a little bit by rory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know that was a wake up call for</v>

2834
01:54:13.641 --> 01:54:16.880
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went back to one 55 and at one 55 in</v>

2835
01:54:16.881 --> 01:54:20.720
<v Speaker 2>his last fight against Michael Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he put on probably the best performance</v>

2836
01:54:20.721 --> 01:54:23.270
<v Speaker 2>up to the conor mcgregor fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best performance of his career.</v>

2837
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:25.420
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking sensations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I view Nate Diaz,</v>

2838
01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of him as a 50 fiver.</v>

2839
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:29.120
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he usually competes at.</v>

2840
01:54:29.121 --> 01:54:31.130
<v Speaker 2>But for this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he didn't want to have to cut</v>

2841
01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:33.290
<v Speaker 2>weight 2011 days out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little heavy.</v>

2842
01:54:33.291 --> 01:54:33.801
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2843
01:54:33.801 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 2>let's make it at one 70 they both agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate Wade,</v>

2844
01:54:36.111 --> 01:54:39.920
<v Speaker 2>one 69 konner weighed one 68 or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

2845
01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean they're basically the same</v>

2846
01:54:42.711 --> 01:54:44.120
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will they find out?</v>

2847
01:54:44.710 --> 01:54:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fought at one 70 what do you mean</v>

2848
01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:48.560
<v Speaker 2>when nate said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight it once every,</v>

2849
01:54:48.561 --> 01:54:49.394
<v Speaker 2>where was he walking up?</v>

2850
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Probably a little heavier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably died it and worked out real</v>

2851
01:54:52.671 --> 01:54:57.140
<v Speaker 2>hard for seven or eight days of the 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>cockpit on the last couple.</v>

2852
01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor didn't have to cut anything.</v>

2853
01:54:59.000 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he cut anything,</v>

2854
01:54:59.901 --> 01:55:01.270
<v Speaker 2>it probably a couple of pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2855
01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.800
<v Speaker 2>which is not tied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't eat.</v>

2856
01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:06.380
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's not even 10 pounds</v>

2857
01:55:06.381 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the same way,</v>

2858
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:10.970
<v Speaker 2>like when they got into the octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you they're within a pound</v>

2859
01:55:10.971 --> 01:55:15.971
<v Speaker 2>or two of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nate is longer and taller and he's a</v>

2860

<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

2883
01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.540
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that people,</v>

2884
01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>he seems swearing and stick it up his</v>
<v Speaker 2>double fingers and they don't realize</v>

2885
01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:22.950
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2886
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Put all that shit aside and observe his</v>
<v Speaker 2>movements,</v>

2887
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:32.010
<v Speaker 2>observe his movements in a fight like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Michael Johnson fight in the,</v>

2888
01:56:32.011 --> 01:56:33.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gummy fight in the markets.</v>

2889
01:56:33.961 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Dave fight in the gray maynard fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Observe his movements.</v>

2890
01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:41.130
<v Speaker 2>He's a motherfucker dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he tees off on you,</v>

2891
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:46.190
<v Speaker 2>he comes at you like a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got long ass on connections of all</v>

2892
01:56:47.221 --> 01:56:51.330
<v Speaker 2>time where it's like 80% of us strucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit strikes in the first round.</v>

2893
01:56:51.331 --> 01:56:52.680
<v Speaker 2>He Lit Donald Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2894
01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:54.390
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing missed.</v>

2895
01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.120
<v Speaker 2>He let Donald Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked on all up in that first round.</v>

2896
01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Donald Donald Donald started coming back</v>
<v Speaker 2>with leg kicks.</v>

2897
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 2>The only guy who's ever really</v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully like put him away in the</v>

2898
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:08.790
<v Speaker 2>UFC was Josh Thompson and Josh Thompson</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most underrated guys.</v>

2899
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.700
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Josh Thompson when he was at his</v>

2900
01:57:11.701 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 2>best left to go over to strike force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people missed out on some</v>

2901
01:57:15.991 --> 01:57:17.940
<v Speaker 2>of the fucking wars that he had over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2902
01:57:18.170 --> 01:57:20.550
<v Speaker 2>And the Gilbert Melendez fights over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and he went through,</v>

2903
01:57:20.551 --> 01:57:21.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of wear and tear on you.</v>

2904
01:57:22.110 --> 01:57:25.770
<v Speaker 2>But like skill for skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Thompson is a mother Fucker,</v>

2905
01:57:25.771 --> 01:57:29.220
<v Speaker 2>but he's now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like 36 time just starts to get</v>

2906
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:31.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at his best.</v>

2907
01:57:31.021 --> 01:57:34.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think that like his last fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Nate Diaz when he head kicked,</v>

2908
01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of like his best performances</v>

2909
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:39.990
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you had some losses after that,</v>

2910
01:57:39.991 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 2>but it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's hard to stay healthy and</v>

2911
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 2>get through a camp when you're 36 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

2912
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:47.070
<v Speaker 2>When those guys get to the late thirties</v>
<v Speaker 2>things start to get.</v>

2913
01:57:47.250 --> 01:57:50.310
<v Speaker 2>So he has one loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the loss in my opinion,</v>

2914
01:57:50.311 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean one stoppage loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the loss to Thompson's like,</v>

2915
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 2>well he's one of the most underrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

2916
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's like solid loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

2917
01:57:56.911 --> 01:57:59.160
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get looked at as solid as it</v>

2918
01:57:59.161 --> 01:57:59.640
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>

2919
01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I think Thompson at its best is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a motherfucker.</v>

2920
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.151
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2921
01:58:03.151 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 2>so let's say he's a natural one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or let's say he wants to fight the</v>

2922
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:07.530
<v Speaker 2>conor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not,</v>

2923
01:58:07.531 --> 01:58:09.780
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just wants to fight this fight at one</v>

2924
01:58:09.781 --> 01:58:12.840
<v Speaker 2>70 and prove his point that he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>appoint to fight exactly the way they</v>

2925
01:58:12.841 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 2>did it before and to come in and fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a bar.</v>

2926
01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:17.910
<v Speaker 2>This is what happens if they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that in the meantime,</v>

2927
01:58:17.911 --> 01:58:22.080
<v Speaker 2>there's lit frankie than Aldo fight for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a title I long ago or vacate the belt</v>

2928
01:58:22.081 --> 01:58:24.690
<v Speaker 2>that you haven't defended once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway should be in the mix as</v>

2929
01:58:24.691 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2930
01:58:25.861 --> 01:58:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I think they also offered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although a shot at Mcgregor and he</v>

2931
01:58:30.571 --> 01:58:33.060
<v Speaker 2>didn't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be a Brazilian thing,</v>

2932
01:58:33.061 --> 01:58:36.200
<v Speaker 2>if you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who else?</v>

2933
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made the injection like heroin,</v>

2934
01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:39.630
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still do that.</v>

2935
01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it was more like he's just</v>

2936
01:58:44.741 --> 01:58:47.920
<v Speaker 2>an unprepared and out of shape and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to get knocked out again.</v>

2937
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy just knocked him out with want</v>

2938
01:58:49.281 --> 01:58:51.970
<v Speaker 2>to fucking punch a couple of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it got,</v>

2939
01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:52.810
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2940
01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:54.150
<v Speaker 2>give me that rematch because we can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>

2941
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:54.971
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2942
01:58:54.971 --> 01:58:59.230
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know that connor was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get worked when Connie got worked by</v>

2943
01:58:59.231 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed the whole game.</v>

2944
01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:01.211
<v Speaker 2>Is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2945
01:59:01.211 --> 01:59:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I can pick this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything changed,</v>

2946
01:59:03.101 --> 01:59:05.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything changed in everyone's</v>

2947
01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:08.380
<v Speaker 2>approach to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you watch a guy get beat up and</v>

2948
01:59:08.381 --> 01:59:10.000
<v Speaker 2>strangled like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta pee again.</v>

2949
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

2950
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:11.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

2951
01:59:11.121 --> 01:59:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about this.</v>

2952
01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is for the folks listing,</v>

2953
01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:21.250
<v Speaker 2>when you watch a guy get beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like conor got beat up against nate and</v>

2954
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 2>he shoots for a take down and then gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken down naked on top of them,</v>

2955
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.670
<v Speaker 2>beats him up and then chokes him a taps</v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>

2956
01:59:27.670 --> 01:59:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Like nate just dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once it got to the ground and he was</v>

2957
01:59:30.191 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 2>already hurt when it got to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everybody goes,</v>

2958
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2959
01:59:34.690 --> 01:59:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Could Hofeld dos Anjos do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could.</v>

2960
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 2>And for a guy like conor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the reasons why he wants</v>

2961
01:59:40.661 --> 01:59:43.510
<v Speaker 2>his fight back is to prove that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>

2962
01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that he tried to take nate out with big</v>
<v Speaker 2>power bombs.</v>

2963
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 2>He gassed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got tired,</v>

2964
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:51.250
<v Speaker 2>and then nate boxed him up in the second</v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

2965
01:59:51.550 --> 01:59:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Nate start tagging him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had him hurt and had them shoot for a</v>

2966
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.710
<v Speaker 2>take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a guy like conor,</v>

2967
01:59:56.770 --> 01:59:59.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to be that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to be that far.</v>

2968
01:59:59.411 --> 02:00:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to be that successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to knock out all though</v>

2969
02:00:02.441 --> 02:00:05.230
<v Speaker 2>with one punch and beat the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in the first round,</v>

2970
02:00:05.231 --> 02:00:09.010
<v Speaker 2>like you called it and beat the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of seaver and stop Chad Mendez when you</v>

2971
02:00:09.011 --> 02:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>wanted to bet millions of dollars on it.</v>

2972
02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a legit 100% motherfucker.</v>

2973
02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:19.530
<v Speaker 2>But the game does not care about</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities.</v>

2974
02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 2>The game does not care about confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually doesn't,</v>

2975
02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To interaction of fists and face and</v>

2976
02:00:25.481 --> 02:00:30.460
<v Speaker 2>chokes and next and kicks and bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not care about anything other</v>

2977
02:00:30.461 --> 02:00:32.740
<v Speaker 2>than what works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like when you see a loss,</v>

2978
02:00:32.741 --> 02:00:35.590
<v Speaker 2>like a Rhonda Rousey getting knocked the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out by Holly Holm,</v>

2979
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 2>it does not mean that Ronda rousey</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>

2980
02:00:38.471 --> 02:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>It does not mean that Holly Holm is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest ever.</v>

2981
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 2>It just means that the game doesn't give</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fuck who you are.</v>

2982
02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to charge face first at a</v>

2983
02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 2>counter striker and she clips you with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first punch.</v>

2984
02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:53.230
<v Speaker 2>You're already at CEC or already at</v>
<v Speaker 2>check,</v>

2985
02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:56.950
<v Speaker 2>you got rocked like the first punch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're getting beat up for four and</v>

2986
02:00:56.951 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 2>a half minutes after that and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>second round comes around.</v>

2987
02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know where the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2988
02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Your ears are going.</v>

2989
02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:09.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't see your fucking eyes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>blurry.</v>

2990
02:01:09.551 --> 02:01:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Must be so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love about UFC as opposed</v>

2991
02:01:13.161 --> 02:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>to boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody goes 29 to no,</v>

2992
02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:18.050
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go six in a row,</v>

2993
02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>that's like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why John Jones,</v>

2994
02:01:20.311 --> 02:01:21.700
<v Speaker 2>it's so spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2995
02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's beating Jon Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones.</v>

2996
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones has one loss and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disqualification.</v>

2997
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:29.870
<v Speaker 2>It's Matt Hamill and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and where he was caressing him on top of</v>

2998
02:01:29.871 --> 02:01:30.770
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a,</v>

2999
02:01:30.771 --> 02:01:34.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a dumb rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like 12 to six elbows from on a clock</v>

3000
02:01:34.581 --> 02:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drop an elbow down from 12 to</v>

3001
02:01:36.441 --> 02:01:38.540
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that made the rules thought</v>

3002
02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>that that's somehow another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dangerous.</v>

3003
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:42.150
<v Speaker 2>It's no different than any other kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>elbows.</v>

3004
02:01:42.151 --> 02:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3005
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:45.650
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rule that they put in place</v>

3006
02:01:45.651 --> 02:01:47.270
<v Speaker 2>because the people that were on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>

3007
02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 2>this is coming from big John McCarthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

3008
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>The people that were on the commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

3009
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:52.993
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3010
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:55.370
<v Speaker 2>they thought that if you dropped a 12 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>six elbow,</v>

3011
02:01:55.371 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>like those espn karate shows go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can break bricks and shit.</v>

3012
02:01:58.730 --> 02:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>You could kill somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

3013
02:02:01.311 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made it illegal.</v>

3014
02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even 12 to six.</v>

3015
02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like one to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid.</v>

3016
02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:09.890
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really,</v>

3017
02:02:09.891 --> 02:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I can fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really almost never 12 to six.</v>

3018
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's always a slight angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way it's fucking dumb.</v>

3019
02:02:15.921 --> 02:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a dumb rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3020
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3021

<v Speaker 3>Rousey and GSP was all upset about it</v>

3036
02:02:48.581 --> 02:02:50.170
<v Speaker 3>because he wanted to date Ronda Rousey</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is that on youtube anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3046
02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:17.410
<v Speaker 3>think we get clips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A daily motion was,</v>

3047
02:03:17.411 --> 02:03:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I think they're all open daily motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>

3048
02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:20.240
<v Speaker 3>any of that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3049
02:03:20.241 --> 02:03:21.580
<v Speaker 3>we got a click that shit and put it on.</v>

3050
02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you have clips?</v>

3051
02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3052
02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't give you a good reason that this</v>

3053
02:03:29.761 --> 02:03:32.520
<v Speaker 2>is the reason why I think the rematches</v>
<v Speaker 2>is huge.</v>

3054
02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why you have to do it.</v>

3055
02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3056
02:03:34.861 --> 02:03:37.110
<v Speaker 2>because conor mcgregor up until that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

3057
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:41.400
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most spectacular fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever attached to this boy talking about</v>

3058
02:03:41.401 --> 02:03:41.910
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3059
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Just the spectacle in that sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular.</v>

3060
02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:48.360
<v Speaker 2>The guy gets on stage and screams at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winds and the crowd goes nuts.</v>

3061
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>The Irish flags are more galvanized the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>

3062
02:03:50.311 --> 02:03:51.740
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even know what galvanized</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

3063
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:54.510
<v Speaker 2>It means like a coating when you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>nail so they don't rust.</v>

3064
02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3065
02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.990
<v Speaker 2>he's spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3066
02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:00.120
<v Speaker 2>And his results inside the ark got</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

3067
02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz fight had been incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic.</v>

3068
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Mid Second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll cut him with an uppercut and</v>

3069
02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:07.260
<v Speaker 2>knocking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like,</v>

3070
02:04:07.261 --> 02:04:08.040
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3071
02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.660
<v Speaker 2>But when a guy like nate Diaz beat you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and beat you the way he beat you,</v>

3072
02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:15.390
<v Speaker 2>the bright thing to do is to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>

3073
02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:18.390
<v Speaker 2>And this why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the rematch is where the big</v>

3074
02:04:18.391 --> 02:04:21.720
<v Speaker 2>money's at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brea match with Nate Diaz is God</v>

3075
02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:24.930
<v Speaker 2>damn scrooge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcduck gigantic die.</v>

3076
02:04:24.931 --> 02:04:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million plus paper view the eyes.</v>

3077
02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:29.640
<v Speaker 2>It's still on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it goes,</v>

3078
02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>let's just say he goes to 45 then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>55 again,</v>

3079
02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.570
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3080
02:04:33.571 --> 02:04:34.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean they will beat you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

3081
02:04:34.921 --> 02:04:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

3082
02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:39.240
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Frankie might beat him.</v>

3083
02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holloway.</v>

3084
02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway might beat him in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>

3085
02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Jose Aldo might beat him now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the Josie especially Julie all know</v>

3087
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Josie Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:04:52.450 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It just comes and real healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what I'm saying?</v>

3089
02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:58.290
<v Speaker 2>If he</v>
<v Speaker 2>chose a,</v>

3090
02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>although he is a fucking nine year</v>
<v Speaker 2>undefeated all time,</v>

3091
02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:05.400
<v Speaker 2>great fighter who got clipped with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>big punch.</v>

3092
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>So what if Aldo fights like in a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to how Meesha tate fought.</v>

3093
02:05:10.141 --> 02:05:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm takes his time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's that motherfucker out and like</v>

3094
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:16.380
<v Speaker 2>round two or three and just stays in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside and leg kicks the shit out of</v>

3095
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If all though just chooses to have,</v>

3096
02:05:18.421 --> 02:05:20.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean all it was so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried to take his head off with a</v>

3097
02:05:20.491 --> 02:05:23.430
<v Speaker 2>left hook and he got clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He load it up and he got clipped.</v>

3098
02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>But what if he doesn't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he goes in there and play slow</v>

3099
02:05:26.201 --> 02:05:27.630
<v Speaker 2>on the outside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starts kicking his legs?</v>

3100
02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:30.330
<v Speaker 2>What if he initiates a clinch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause let me tell you something about</v>

3101
02:05:30.331 --> 02:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>all those Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking world class like you watch</v>

3102
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:38.580
<v Speaker 2>or Aldo versus Mike Brown in the UFC a</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the WEC rather.</v>

3103
02:05:38.581 --> 02:05:41.190
<v Speaker 2>When he wanted a welterweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll featherweight title can't get</v>

3104
02:05:41.191 --> 02:05:41.760
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3105
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.050
<v Speaker 2>When he won the featherweight title to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3106
02:05:43.051 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 2>he takes his back like a fucking world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

3107
02:05:45.841 --> 02:05:48.330
<v Speaker 2>It's smashes him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what Anderson did when he</v>

3108
02:05:48.331 --> 02:05:51.830
<v Speaker 2>was at his best was he would get booze</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the first and second round and he's</v>

3109
02:05:51.831 --> 02:05:53.980
<v Speaker 2>just almost like this says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you to fucking relax?</v>

3110
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to knock this guy out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different style though.</v>

3111
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:58.140
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to push.</v>

3112
02:05:58.170 --> 02:06:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I will wait and I will get you when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to help continue to win.</v>

3113
02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson has a very unique style.</v>

3114
02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:07.860
<v Speaker 2>His style is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lot of Moyie Thai,</v>

3115
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:11.280
<v Speaker 2>but he also has a lot of traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts as well.</v>

3116
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Like some of the things that he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the front kick to the face,</v>

3117
02:06:14.941 --> 02:06:18.840
<v Speaker 2>the way he does a front snap kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a Meu type push kick or a</v>

3118
02:06:18.841 --> 02:06:19.650
<v Speaker 2>team.</v>

3119
02:06:19.650 --> 02:06:21.910
<v Speaker 2>It was like a karate style kick was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid for that fight.</v>

3120
02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Dude at the MGM and I sit next to each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other on acid screaming when he kicked</v>

3121
02:06:27.931 --> 02:06:29.400
<v Speaker 2>him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that dude,</v>

3122
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 2>that was a spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the first time we'd ever seen</v>

3123
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.010
<v Speaker 2>a front kick to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kao in the UFC.</v>

3124
02:06:35.690 --> 02:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3125
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:37.980
<v Speaker 2>that'd be tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stunning.</v>

3126
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>So Anderson was a sniper and what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do is he would find your range,</v>

3127
02:06:42.751 --> 02:06:45.520
<v Speaker 2>find your timing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would unload on shows.</v>

3128
02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I can go a little close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3129
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.161
<v Speaker 2>close look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3130
02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:50.250
<v Speaker 2>now I'm in my ranch or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with different fighters who fought,</v>

3131
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 2>fought a different style like with rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franklin.</v>

3132
02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 2>He overwhelmed were in the clinch like</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich Franklin didn't have an answer to</v>

3133
02:06:55.261 --> 02:06:58.500
<v Speaker 2>is what's called a plum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when a guy grabs the back of your</v>

3134
02:06:58.501 --> 02:07:00.750
<v Speaker 2>head like this and pinches down with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>forearms.</v>

3135
02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the MEU Thai clinch.</v>

3136
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Like when like anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's levels to it.</v>

3137
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how,</v>

3138
02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:08.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a good way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3139
02:07:09.010 --> 02:07:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you tie your shoes and you tie your</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes effortlessly,</v>

3140
02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 2>just reached down and cause you've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>it your whole life.</v>

3141
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 2>You are pathway like the neuromuscular</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway to tying your shoes is</v>

3142
02:07:18.721 --> 02:07:21.540
<v Speaker 2>automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain movements that become</v>

3143
02:07:21.541 --> 02:07:22.770
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're,</v>

3144
02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.840
<v Speaker 2>you're sparring or you're fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>

3145
02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:28.140
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you'll move out of the way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing a counter before you</v>

3146
02:07:28.141 --> 02:07:31.500
<v Speaker 2>even realize you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's too fast for you to even think</v>

3147
02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:32.420
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've,</v>

3148
02:07:32.710 --> 02:07:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you've carved that path so deeply in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neuro muscular structure that when</v>

3149
02:07:38.441 --> 02:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>someone does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do that.</v>

3150
02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:42.430
<v Speaker 2>When you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you counter there,</v>

3151
02:07:42.431 --> 02:07:44.320
<v Speaker 2>you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize openings without even</v>

3152
02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>being conscious of it.</v>

3153
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:50.140
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a guy gets in those grooves,</v>

3154
02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.950
<v Speaker 2>when you get in those groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to,</v>

3155
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it if you don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>groove.</v>

3156
02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 2>And Anderson had that groove when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to that Moy Thai clinch.</v>

3157
02:07:57.971 --> 02:08:00.460
<v Speaker 2>She could see it the way he was holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto him,</v>

3158
02:08:00.650 --> 02:08:05.650
<v Speaker 2>pushing those fights and Chai or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Thai kickboxing fights and it's</v>

3159
02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:07.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the things out there punching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking,</v>

3160
02:08:07.241 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>but they did that throw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it almost doesn't seem like it that much</v>

3161
02:08:09.821 --> 02:08:10.930
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh it does.</v>

3162
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It's what's humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was more like the,</v>

3163
02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:15.210
<v Speaker 2>the wind knocked out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3164
02:08:15.330 --> 02:08:18.760
<v Speaker 2>if the guy kicks your legs out from</v>
<v Speaker 2>under you and slams you on your back,</v>

3165
02:08:18.761 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the wind knocked out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get your,</v>

3166
02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you're injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get your shoulder's injured,</v>

3167
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you can get your ribs injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neck can get injured if you follow</v>

3168
02:08:25.781 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 2>the wrong way or you get knocked on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way down.</v>

3169
02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.430
<v Speaker 2>And in some organizations you can kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the face.</v>

3170
02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:31.820
<v Speaker 2>On the way down to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3171
02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:35.080
<v Speaker 2>they'll flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll throw kicks and then as you</v>

3172
02:08:35.081 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 2>are scrubbed before the referee gets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3173
02:08:36.731 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 2>they'll fucking knew you in the face as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going down,</v>

3174
02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:41.260
<v Speaker 2>even with your gloves touching the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

3175
02:08:41.261 --> 02:08:44.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like legal and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations to knee or even kick you</v>

3176
02:08:44.591 --> 02:08:45.880
<v Speaker 2>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3177
02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:48.140
<v Speaker 2>So you got to read the funding herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought I'll just follow the way</v>

3178
02:08:48.141 --> 02:08:53.141
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to brace myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] has some crazy approaches.</v>

3179
02:08:53.410 --> 02:08:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're clench.</v>

3180
02:08:55.271 --> 02:08:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Work is like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>underappreciated aspects of the sport</v>

3181
02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:02.110
<v Speaker 2>because everybody thinks of it as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>striking sport is,</v>

3182
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:06.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's also grappling sport because</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they tie up inside that clinch,</v>

3183
02:09:06.731 --> 02:09:08.840
<v Speaker 2>the guys who are really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3184
02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:13.780
<v Speaker 2>they execute these nasty trips and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>also the way of manipulating you into</v>

3185
02:09:13.781 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 2>knees and like when someone has a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they clamped down and they know how to</v>

3186
02:09:18.161 --> 02:09:19.210
<v Speaker 2>control your neck.</v>

3187
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a very confusing feeling if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not accustomed to it from a high level</v>

3188
02:09:23.111 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>practitioner because you get locked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do.</v>

3189
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:28.390
<v Speaker 2>You start grabbing at it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting need and the body and then you</v>

3190
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:30.670
<v Speaker 2>get kneed in the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said that's one of the most</v>

3191
02:09:30.671 --> 02:09:34.330
<v Speaker 2>brutal things whenever the whole crowd</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets behind it too,</v>

3192
02:09:34.331 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 2>and they can start growing news news as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as that clinched comes in and they</v>

3193
02:09:37.211 --> 02:09:39.820
<v Speaker 2>all want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Anderson kneed him in the face.</v>

3194
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:42.780
<v Speaker 2>He's destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were tranquil ins knows retracted,</v>

3195
02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>had to get his nose completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstructed.</v>

3196
02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was devastated after that.</v>

3197
02:09:47.531 --> 02:09:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Hers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>

3202
02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:02.830
<v Speaker 2>masterclass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3203
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3204
02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3205
02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at his very first fight in the</v>

3206
02:10:07.151 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might've been,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it was definitely the actual match.</v>

3209
02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:16.570
<v Speaker 2>They'll pull it back so you can see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual of the niece of the face before</v>

3210
02:10:16.571 --> 02:10:17.740

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3212
02:10:19.181 --> 02:10:21.850
<v Speaker 2>well he starts doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starts moving them around and</v>

3213
02:10:21.851 --> 02:10:23.330
<v Speaker 2>manipulating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

3214
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:25.840
<v Speaker 2>so Richard's trying to punch him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look how he manipulates him with</v>

3215
02:10:25.841 --> 02:10:27.640
<v Speaker 2>these fucking knees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the clinch just,</v>

3216
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:30.520
<v Speaker 2>he never lets that clinch go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

3217
02:10:30.521 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just holding onto the back his neck.</v>

3218
02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 2>See I was doing with his left hand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's needing his body and then he grabs</v>

3219
02:10:38.031 --> 02:10:39.290
<v Speaker 2>a hold of it with two hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3220
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3221
02:10:40.701 --> 02:10:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Boom to the body so we can toss them</v>
<v Speaker 2>around to the body and he's sliding</v>

3222
02:10:44.421 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

3223
02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.330
<v Speaker 2>And when rich goes to punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outmaneuvering him,</v>

3224
02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.990
<v Speaker 2>he's getting his shoulders in play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his shoulders are blocking these wide</v>

3225
02:10:50.991 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 2>looping punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's just leaning his hips back</v>

3226
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:57.590
<v Speaker 2>and forcing them to like to absorb these</v>
<v Speaker 2>knees to the body.</v>

3227
02:10:57.591 --> 02:10:59.870
<v Speaker 2>And each one of them is Wiki a more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more.</v>

3228
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:01.070
<v Speaker 2>And Boom,</v>

3229
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Boom again and that balance to the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

3230
02:11:04.521 --> 02:11:05.061
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

3231
02:11:05.061 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 2>and there's a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He grabs him again,</v>

3232
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to the chin,</v>

3233
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:11.750
<v Speaker 2>boom to the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom to the body and the ways moving</v>

3234
02:11:11.751 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 2>them in a manipulating a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is some high level shit and you</v>

3235
02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:21.080
<v Speaker 2>just didn't at the time see this level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of more tie in a,</v>

3236
02:11:21.090 --> 02:11:24.710
<v Speaker 2>in mma it was very rare to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from this position,</v>

3237
02:11:24.711 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>is a very rare position to see prolonged</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an MMA fight up into this point.</v>

3238
02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:32.030
<v Speaker 2>So there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nose is just shattered and now Anderson</v>

3239
02:11:32.031 --> 02:11:33.920
<v Speaker 2>just moving in for the kill and he gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>it again.</v>

3240
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hits him in the temple and that's it.</v>

3241
02:11:35.961 --> 02:11:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3242
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 2>And his nose was destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean destroyed.</v>

3243
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:43.340
<v Speaker 2>It was like on the other side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see right there.</v>

3244
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.030
<v Speaker 2>You could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3245
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that's when he took the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back it up just a little bit Jamie.</v>

3246
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:48.820
<v Speaker 2>You can see the nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it.</v>

3247
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3248
02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.080
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it go right there.</v>

3249
02:11:51.550 --> 02:11:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Why Watch when he look at his nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cave at the top.</v>

3250
02:11:55.611 --> 02:11:57.530
<v Speaker 2>There's no bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bridge,</v>

3251
02:11:57.590 --> 02:11:59.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely smashed.</v>

3252
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as knows was never the same again.</v>

3253
02:12:02.751 --> 02:12:06.980
<v Speaker 2>He had to get a nasal reconstruction</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery and it was a big deal and they,</v>

3254
02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:07.971
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>

3255
02:12:07.971 --> 02:12:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put splints on your fucking back up.</v>

3256
02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:14.300
<v Speaker 2>They came back or fought him again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fought Anderson again,</v>

3257
02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:16.590
<v Speaker 2>got beat up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just [inaudible].</v>

3258
02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:19.100
<v Speaker 2>He did his best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought well and he fought,</v>

3259
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 2>fought great fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean rich Franklin had some great</v>

3260
02:12:21.681 --> 02:12:24.680
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay Silva in the UFC knocked out</v>

3261
02:12:24.681 --> 02:12:26.600
<v Speaker 2>chocolate down as low as five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3262
02:12:26.601 --> 02:12:28.610
<v Speaker 2>chuck was later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck was his last fight.</v>

3263
02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:30.470
<v Speaker 2>The last fight in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a broken arm.</v>

3264
02:12:30.471 --> 02:12:31.380
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3265
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Or fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one shot go for chuck broke his</v>

3266
02:12:34.311 --> 02:12:36.440
<v Speaker 2>left arm with the kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck kick.</v>

3267
02:12:36.441 --> 02:12:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Fucking aw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

3268
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That's some good fights in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3269
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 2>But that was like the first time we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen that level of that clinch in a</v>

3270
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:47.270
<v Speaker 2>world championship level fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never seen anybody control someone</v>

3271
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:49.330
<v Speaker 2>for that long with a Thai clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like Wah.</v>

3272
02:12:49.610 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>So Anderson was like responsible for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of innovation.</v>

3273
02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:55.970
<v Speaker 2>A lot of firsts and not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation in that he's using like</v>

3274
02:12:55.971 --> 02:12:59.690
<v Speaker 2>pretty standard traditional techniques</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that respective art form.</v>

3275
02:12:59.691 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Like a front kick is the most standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique ever.</v>

3276
02:13:02.090 --> 02:13:05.540
<v Speaker 2>But oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no front kick Kaos until he</v>

3277
02:13:05.541 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>knocked out vitor Belfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing when you see that and then</v>

3278
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 2>it opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skateboarding has that too where it's</v>

3279
02:13:10.251 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 2>like someone will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes,</v>

3280
02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:12.950
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's all do that.</v>

3281
02:13:13.130 --> 02:13:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Leonardo knocked out,</v>

3282
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:17.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy coture with a jumping front kick</v>

3283
02:13:17.541 --> 02:13:19.130
<v Speaker 2>to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody was like,</v>

3284
02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:22.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto and from like 60,000 people.</v>

3285
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:25.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3286
02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.280
<v Speaker 2>When are they going to do the garden?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where they can do it now.</v>

3287
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:33.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just recently got past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to finish up this Frankie Edgar</v>

3288
02:13:33.421 --> 02:13:36.260
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Edgar could beat him if,</v>

3289
02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:40.140
<v Speaker 2>if he can get taken down and dominant</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that with nate.</v>

3290
02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Frankie's a goddamn tornado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie.</v>

3291
02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.353
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

3292
02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:44.830
<v Speaker 2>For getting left out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a,</v>

3293
02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.070
<v Speaker 2>there's a title eliminator fight and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been like,</v>

3294
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I guess not a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

3295
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>well where this title shot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did what he had to say.</v>

3296
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:54.990
<v Speaker 2>You said when this and you got a title</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot financially though,</v>

3297
02:13:54.991 --> 02:13:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand their point of</v>

3298
02:13:56.881 --> 02:13:57.240
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3299
02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>But in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although edgar interim title,</v>

3300
02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:01.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Max Holloway.</v>

3301
02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Max Holloway's in the mix as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sue the jump.</v>

3302
02:14:05.890 --> 02:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could wah,</v>

3303
02:14:07.190 --> 02:14:10.290
<v Speaker 2>it would be either hot ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I say?</v>

3304
02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 2>You got to get all doorframe actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to give all the pretty much</v>

3305
02:14:12.391 --> 02:14:13.820
<v Speaker 2>nine straight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no losses.</v>

3306
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:15.390
<v Speaker 2>You got to let them fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3307
02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a rematch.</v>

3308
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Nofziger I'm saying like title who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>either against a connor or whoever.</v>

3309
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:21.881
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3310
02:14:21.881 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a number one contender.</v>

3311
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:28.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a good call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could set up a fight.</v>

3312
02:14:28.290 --> 02:14:31.920
<v Speaker 2>We're frankie fights Max Holloway or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other eliminator.</v>

3313
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with Dafydd is then you get</v>

3314
02:14:34.321 --> 02:14:36.600
<v Speaker 2>rid of like one of the contenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3315
02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.510
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it actually comes to pass,</v>

3316
02:14:38.511 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's already done that title</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminator thing he wanted,</v>

3317
02:14:42.030 --> 02:14:45.960
<v Speaker 2>he did what he's asked to that half Max</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holloway fight the winner of Aldo.</v>

3318
02:14:46.290 --> 02:14:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie,</v>

3319
02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 2>the real problem is a financial problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the money with Nate Diaz is</v>

3320
02:14:51.391 --> 02:14:54.800
<v Speaker 2>going to be so God damn gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the meantime also had that fight.</v>

3321
02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:56.360
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is one of those guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep,</v>

3322
02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.630
<v Speaker 2>get lost and get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3323
02:14:58.670 --> 02:14:59.503
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3324
02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:02.070
<v Speaker 2>did you have three pieces in play at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>45?</v>

3325
02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying like the real,</v>

3326
02:15:05.671 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the smart move really is you tell connor</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to pick a weight class and if you</v>

3327
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:13.680
<v Speaker 2>want to fight at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to give up your 145 pound title</v>

3328
02:15:13.681 --> 02:15:16.230
<v Speaker 2>and they fight for the real title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for the interim title.</v>

3329
02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:17.700
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real thing.</v>

3330
02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Like just give up your title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give it up.</v>

3331
02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.260
<v Speaker 2>John Jones had to give up his title</v>
<v Speaker 2>because illegal problems,</v>

3332
02:15:22.261 --> 02:15:23.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3333
02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to give it up because uh,</v>

3334
02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:27.840
<v Speaker 2>er Aldo had to give it up because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't fight for awhile.</v>

3335
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.161
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3336
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never did get it and give up a</v>

3337
02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:30.870
<v Speaker 2>steady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3338
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:32.580
<v Speaker 2>in terms of being trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the interim.</v>

3339
02:15:32.670 --> 02:15:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Just give up your title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3340
02:15:34.231 --> 02:15:35.550
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a loss.</v>

3341
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:38.160
<v Speaker 2>The loss to nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go to one 70 that means you</v>

3342
02:15:38.161 --> 02:15:40.350
<v Speaker 2>campaigning there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just freeze up the division.</v>

3343
02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:44.550
<v Speaker 2>So then you have Aldo versus frankie for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real fucking title.</v>

3344
02:15:44.551 --> 02:15:45.960
<v Speaker 2>And they fought already before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

3345
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Although frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes and although beat Frankie and was</v>

3346
02:15:48.841 --> 02:15:52.410
<v Speaker 2>doing Aldo in his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that Frankie is better right</v>

3347
02:15:52.411 --> 02:15:54.000
<v Speaker 2>now than he was then.</v>

3348
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.180
<v Speaker 2>And I think that he's got some key wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fights.</v>

3349
02:15:57.181 --> 02:15:59.580
<v Speaker 2>He's not supposed to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all he keeps doing and doing it</v>

3350
02:15:59.581 --> 02:16:00.780
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps winning fights.</v>

3351
02:16:00.781 --> 02:16:01.690
<v Speaker 2>He's not supposed to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3352
02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:03.190
<v Speaker 2>he wins fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's supposed to win too.</v>

3353
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.411
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3354
02:16:04.411 --> 02:16:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Faber fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Frankie still start,</v>

3355
02:16:06.881 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 2>he makes his name on these fucking Bj</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and at these all these fights,</v>

3356
02:16:10.051 --> 02:16:10.651
<v Speaker 2>it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

3357
02:16:10.651 --> 02:16:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just keep doing it.</v>

3358
02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:17.560
<v Speaker 2>The Cub Swanson fight was a overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and then the Chad Mendez knock</v>

3359
02:16:17.561 --> 02:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knocked out Chad Mendez with one</v>

3360
02:16:19.051 --> 02:16:20.970
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's at the top of the heap in my</v>

3361
02:16:20.971 --> 02:16:23.720
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that a rematch was not,</v>

3362
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad idea between frankie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aldo for the title and you have that on</v>

3363
02:16:28.381 --> 02:16:33.030
<v Speaker 2>an undercard of a UFC 200 or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you've been hotter,</v>

3364
02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 2>want someday to come back to 45 and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sure man will give you a title</v>

3365
02:16:35.741 --> 02:16:36.574
<v Speaker 2>fight right away.</v>

3366
02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:38.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not like connor is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that.</v>

3367
02:16:38.111 --> 02:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>He already beat Aldo and knocked him out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one punch.</v>

3368
02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:42.880
<v Speaker 2>He could talk all kinds of mad shit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rematch.</v>

3369
02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 2>They could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run it all back again.</v>

3370
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:47.530
<v Speaker 2>If all though can get past frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3371
02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a lot of fun stuff that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3372
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 2>But the nate diaz fight has to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>place because here's my point was this</v>

3373
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:57.040
<v Speaker 2>is my final point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if he beats nate diaz,</v>

3374
02:16:57.070 --> 02:17:00.430
<v Speaker 2>he silences everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he goes out there and he fights smart</v>

3375
02:17:00.490 --> 02:17:03.190
<v Speaker 2>and he sniped him and he stays the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the boxing,</v>

3376
02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 2>he uses a lot of leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Way dos Anjos did takes the front,</v>

3377
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:08.830
<v Speaker 2>cause nate stands real heavy on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front leg.</v>

3378
02:17:08.831 --> 02:17:12.250
<v Speaker 2>His front leg will be his right leg and</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor is a southpaw.</v>

3379
02:17:12.310 --> 02:17:15.430
<v Speaker 2>So set connor will be throwing a hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>left leg kick from the back leg.</v>

3380
02:17:15.610 --> 02:17:17.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a good setup for him in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>

3381
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:20.650
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor knows now he can't knock me out</v>

3382
02:17:20.651 --> 02:17:22.050
<v Speaker 2>with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we go,</v>

3383
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:24.070
<v Speaker 2>so he's not going to load up and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncork.</v>

3384
02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:27.010
<v Speaker 2>He's going to try to fight smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in fighting smart,</v>

3385
02:17:27.250 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 2>then he'll be able to incorporate leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks and he'll be able to incorporate,</v>

3386
02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll also understand he's got to</v>

3387
02:17:33.281 --> 02:17:34.640
<v Speaker 2>fucking stay off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3388
02:17:34.641 --> 02:17:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3389
02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do well on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground one.</v>

3390
02:17:36.461 --> 02:17:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

3391
02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:39.550
<v Speaker 2>he's at a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high level on the ground.</v>

3392
02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:42.520
<v Speaker 2>So unless connor gets way better with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Jujitsu,</v>

3393
02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:44.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time that fight takes place,</v>

3394
02:17:44.490 --> 02:17:47.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just keep the fight standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use a lot of leg kicks,</v>

3395
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:49.150
<v Speaker 2>you any beats them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you beat some,</v>

3396
02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:50.860
<v Speaker 2>if he beats him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he beats nate,</v>

3397
02:17:50.861 --> 02:17:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Diaz loses.</v>

3398
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he loses,</v>

3399
02:17:54.250 --> 02:17:56.020
<v Speaker 2>he was gonna lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might've lost a frankie.</v>

3400
02:17:56.021 --> 02:17:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say he's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could have lost all,</v>

3401
02:17:57.781 --> 02:17:59.230
<v Speaker 2>do a rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything could have happened.</v>

3402
02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>And then that Nate Diaz money's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the Nate Diaz,</v>

3403
02:18:02.591 --> 02:18:05.290
<v Speaker 2>money's the big money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the most famous guy along with</v>

3404
02:18:05.291 --> 02:18:06.430
<v Speaker 2>connor right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he wins,</v>

3405
02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a 100% and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they give up that fucking title</v>

3406
02:18:11.321 --> 02:18:14.980
<v Speaker 2>at one 45 and get fucking rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3407
02:18:14.981 --> 02:18:16.090
<v Speaker 2>at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

3408
02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:16.690
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3409
02:18:16.690 --> 02:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>if you're a martial artist and emphasize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artists,</v>

3410
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:23.250
<v Speaker 2>give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your fucking titles the way Chris</v>

3411
02:18:23.251 --> 02:18:24.780
<v Speaker 2>serone seems to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3412
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just here to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3413
02:18:26.021 --> 02:18:29.110
<v Speaker 2>You play whatever belt you want on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly want that title.</v>

3414
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:31.230
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3415
02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I feel what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:18:32.850 --> 02:18:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about money.</v>

3417
02:18:34.931 --> 02:18:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3418
02:18:36.161 --> 02:18:38.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm money fights are what's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important and it's not a matter of</v>

3419
02:18:38.951 --> 02:18:39.550
<v Speaker 2>titles.</v>

3420
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:43.000
<v Speaker 2>No one want to give a fuck if neither</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate Diaz doesn't have a title.</v>

3421
02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And conor mcgregor is not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>welterweight champion.</v>

3422
02:18:45.161 --> 02:18:48.250
<v Speaker 2>If he gave up his title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't mean a goddamn thing.</v>

3423
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:49.740
<v Speaker 2>The war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great.</v>

3424
02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:54.670
<v Speaker 2>Former featherweight champion versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>former ultimate fighter winner who</v>

3425
02:18:54.671 --> 02:18:57.370
<v Speaker 2>stopped this guy in a second round of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their last fight.</v>

3426
02:18:57.371 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a spectacular fight and the trash</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so good.</v>

3427
02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant fight.</v>

3428
02:19:01.161 --> 02:19:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Steroids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant.</v>

3431
02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.580
<v Speaker 2>What have I ever done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done it.</v>

3432
02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3433
02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:13.540
<v Speaker 2>so correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate and nate was an flap ton flappable,</v>

3434
02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:16.120
<v Speaker 2>but all of that last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

3435
02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you got to stop talking to the Reps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

3436
02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:18.671
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

3437
02:19:18.671 --> 02:19:20.740
<v Speaker 2>That's how I fight whatever fight in</v>
<v Speaker 2>stockton.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can't tell him to talk shit.</v>

3439
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:24.440
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean is that a rental</v>
<v Speaker 2>referee needs to shut the fuck up.</v>

3440
02:19:24.670 --> 02:19:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

3441
02:19:26.650 --> 02:19:29.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot stuff that referees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>referee's get a little busy in there.</v>

3442
02:19:29.181 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they interfere too much.</v>

3443
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.830
<v Speaker 2>They talk too much fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on guys.</v>

3445
02:19:34.581 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Like when they are fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I say that like when guys are</v>

3446
02:19:37.191 --> 02:19:39.680
<v Speaker 2>clenching and they have a turncoat what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3447
02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>there's some referees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not that good.</v>

3448
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3449
02:19:42.710 --> 02:19:43.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

3450
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:45.830
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that say it when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate,</v>

3451
02:19:45.831 --> 02:19:47.630
<v Speaker 2>like herb dean will say it when it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>

3452
02:19:47.631 --> 02:19:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're stalling,</v>

3453
02:19:48.881 --> 02:19:51.380
<v Speaker 2>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a gold standard.</v>

3454
02:19:51.381 --> 02:19:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Him and mccarthy are the gold standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the best.</v>

3455
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:55.220
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Rosenfeld,</v>

3456
02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I would tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw once at the Pearl,</v>

3457
02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3458
02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:02.380
<v Speaker 3>her being called a fight and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3459
02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:05.560
<v Speaker 3>people were booing early stoppage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early stoppage,</v>

3460
02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:08.570
<v Speaker 3>and I saw him walk out of the optic</v>
<v Speaker 3>octagon optic on it.</v>

3461
02:20:08.890 --> 02:20:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I saw him walking out of the octagon and</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the replay and watch it.</v>

3462
02:20:12.851 --> 02:20:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I saw him watch it and then he sees the</v>
<v Speaker 3>replay go.</v>

3463
02:20:15.250 --> 02:20:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>

3464
02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:17.453
<v Speaker 3>I did the right thing.</v>

3465
02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3466
02:20:18.381 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and I had a conversation after the</v>

3467
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3468
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia fought Frank Mir and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience is booing cause he stopped the</v>

3469
02:20:26.811 --> 02:20:31.610
<v Speaker 2>fight because they didn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw it because I had the replay in</v>

3470
02:20:31.611 --> 02:20:34.430
<v Speaker 2>front of me and the spleen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience didn't have a screen that</v>

3471
02:20:34.470 --> 02:20:36.380
<v Speaker 2>they could call it from the truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly.</v>

3472
02:20:36.381 --> 02:20:39.110
<v Speaker 2>So they had to pull it up on the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen where you could see frank's arm</v>

3473
02:20:39.111 --> 02:20:40.190
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3474
02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:42.110
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>

3475
02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>he see Tim's on break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3476
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 2>So frank got him in an arm bar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapped his forum in half,</v>

3477
02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.140
<v Speaker 2>and herb was right there and called it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the referee,</v>

3478
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:53.810
<v Speaker 2>the audience was screaming Booboo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>booboo.</v>

3479
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:56.240
<v Speaker 2>But when I got in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3480
02:20:56.241 --> 02:20:57.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

3481
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it was broken.</v>

3482
02:20:58.530 --> 02:20:59.151
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3483
02:20:59.151 --> 02:20:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I heard it.</v>

3484
02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then we played it back to the</v>

3485
02:21:02.991 --> 02:21:03.860
<v Speaker 2>audience and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3486
02:21:03.861 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

3487
02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:05.720
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3488
02:21:05.721 --> 02:21:08.390
<v Speaker 2>that's a broken arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it showed it to,</v>

3489
02:21:08.410 --> 02:21:09.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia and Tim Sylvia,</v>

3490
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:11.660
<v Speaker 2>thank [inaudible] herb dean after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

3491
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:13.250
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was complaining about the early</v>

3492
02:21:13.251 --> 02:21:15.110
<v Speaker 2>stoppage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you saved my career.</v>

3493
02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Like my fucking arm is broken in half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so herb was like,</v>

3494
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:20.660
<v Speaker 2>here are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard the snap saw the bone a lot</v>

3495
02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:23.750
<v Speaker 2>more damage than fucking with it or her</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the perfect position.</v>

3496
02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:25.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good referees as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>holiday.</v>

3497
02:21:25.461 --> 02:21:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank yeah,</v>

3498
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 2>thank you for saving my career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally his fucking arm man,</v>

3499
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:31.970
<v Speaker 2>because if someone yanks on a compound</v>
<v Speaker 2>fracture and it goes right through the</v>

3500
02:21:31.971 --> 02:21:35.120
<v Speaker 2>skin and the bone birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he use all sorts of risk of infection.</v>

3501
02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:37.760
<v Speaker 2>The real serious complications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3502
02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:39.530
<v Speaker 2>who knows if that arms ever going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same again,</v>

3503
02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:44.740
<v Speaker 3>most exciting fight I might've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Silvia Radica tour in Columbus.</v>

3504
02:21:44.810 --> 02:21:47.050
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] verify first five they ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>had in Columbus,</v>

3505
02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:48.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not passed on the first round.</v>

3506
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:50.260
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3507
02:21:50.470 --> 02:21:51.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3508
02:21:51.161 --> 02:21:53.130
<v Speaker 3>he can't take the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3509
02:21:53.350 --> 02:21:54.430
<v Speaker 3>that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One one round.</v>

3510
02:21:54.431 --> 02:21:55.264
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

3511
02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:56.650
<v Speaker 3>And then went on the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3512
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:58.390
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he wins one more round,</v>

3513
02:21:58.420 --> 02:22:00.980
<v Speaker 3>he'll win the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were any big brother to him?</v>

3514
02:22:01.570 --> 02:22:02.403
<v Speaker 3>Beat him five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

3515
02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:03.251
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3516
02:22:03.251 --> 02:22:08.200
<v Speaker 2>he stepped in with like the inside leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick fake to the big right hand and just</v>

3517
02:22:08.290 --> 02:22:09.760
<v Speaker 2>collaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia.</v>

3518
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:12.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think tim just totally never</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovered from that and it was probably</v>

3519
02:22:12.881 --> 02:22:15.880
<v Speaker 2>just caught him on the Chin and whopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

3520
02:22:16.330 --> 02:22:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see Tim Sylvia when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Ray Mercer?</v>

3521
02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3522
02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.040
<v Speaker 2>that was a crazy idea.</v>

3523
02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:24.440
<v Speaker 3>That was a crazy still fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The leg kick timmers like we're not</v>

3524
02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:25.950
<v Speaker 3>going to do it kicks right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're under the pussy.</v>

3525
02:22:25.951 --> 02:22:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3526
02:22:26.490 --> 02:22:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Fake the leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what was supposed to happen.</v>

3527
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:30.480
<v Speaker 1>They were supposed to have a boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

3528
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be Raymar surface tim</v>
<v Speaker 1>silver with a boxing match.</v>

3529
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:35.700
<v Speaker 1>But because Ray Mercer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3530
02:22:35.850 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>was a world champion and Tim Silvia</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any pro boxing matches,</v>

3531
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>the section isn't sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to make it mma,</v>

3532
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:43.343
<v Speaker 1>which they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3533
02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.570
<v Speaker 1>we both know we're just going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

3534
02:22:45.571 --> 02:22:46.141
<v Speaker 1>And they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3535
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:46.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3536
02:22:46.621 --> 02:22:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to that.</v>

3537
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And then Tim Silvia leg kicked him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Mercer hit him with a haymaker from</v>

3538
02:22:52.741 --> 02:22:55.470
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a haymaker on steroids.</v>

3539
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:59.860

<v Speaker 1>the history of boxing through.</v>

3559
02:23:40.690 --> 02:23:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Morrison was the guy.</v>

3560
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:46.260
<v Speaker 1>He was the white hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought he was going to be the</v>

3561
02:23:46.261 --> 02:23:48.300
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the rocky movie.</v>

3562

<v Speaker 1>He was this bad ass and he fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking Ray Mercer and Ray Mercer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was caught in the road.</v>

3572
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Should have been down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was brutal.</v>

3574
02:24:17.551 --> 02:24:21.810
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the worst Kaos ever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison came back from that,</v>

3575
02:24:21.811 --> 02:24:24.960
<v Speaker 1>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

3576
02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 1>He was always fucked up from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fight was just devastating.</v>

3581
02:24:40.021 --> 02:24:42.900

<v Speaker 2>Bella.</v>

3606
02:25:45.341 --> 02:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Donna was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bella,</v>

3607
02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Donna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't the audience.</v>

3608
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked tired.</v>

3609
02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.100
<v Speaker 2>She got out of the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really come across porn hub</v>

3610
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:55.480
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get out of the businessman.</v>

3611
02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:56.531
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3612
02:25:56.531 --> 02:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I started with nothing Diaz and Marin</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in the first one.</v>

3613
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Did you start from the bottom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're here.</v>

3614
02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess</v>

3615
02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.430
<v Speaker 2>now the whole crew's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's might be true.</v>

3616
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I think that really holds true.</v>

3617
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an arguable this point,</v>

3618
02:26:11.530 --> 02:26:13.360
<v Speaker 2>dawn and from the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're here.</v>

3619
02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:15.460
<v Speaker 2>This is not in three weeks in the season</v>
<v Speaker 2>finale.</v>

3620
02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So a cyborgs in the UFC now too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

3621
02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I just heard that from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're open pool.</v>

3622
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

3623
02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:23.770
<v Speaker 2>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3624
02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.040
<v Speaker 2>At one 41 40 fights it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 yes.</v>

3625
02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:33.840
<v Speaker 2>And she's going to fight Leslie Smith</v>
<v Speaker 2>who fights at one 35 she's the girl at</v>

3626
02:26:33.841 --> 02:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>her ear exploded or here got torn off by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jessica.</v>

3627
02:26:37.091 --> 02:26:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>

3628
02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a problem,</v>

3629
02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:45.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's a one 40 pound weight class</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of a one 45 that's the one 45 is</v>

3630
02:26:45.701 --> 02:26:48.640
<v Speaker 2>what she's champion of and Invicta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the idea is that they</v>

3631
02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:51.490
<v Speaker 2>worried that they don't have enough 145</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound talent.</v>

3632
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I think they didn't have enough hunted</v>
<v Speaker 2>know for sure they didn't have 115 pound</v>

3633
02:26:58.181 --> 02:27:00.550
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the third about to give somebody</v>

3634
02:27:00.551 --> 02:27:02.890
<v Speaker 2>a third rematch in five years.</v>

3635
02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

3636
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 2>what you mean we should tape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like you don't have a deep enough</v>

3637
02:27:08.321 --> 02:27:10.060
<v Speaker 2>weight class if that's what you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3638
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Well sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's the same problem</v>

3639
02:27:12.731 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have right now at</v>
<v Speaker 2>welterweight.</v>

3640
02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:16.900
<v Speaker 2>The same problem you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one 45,</v>

3641
02:27:16.901 --> 02:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>which has a lot of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of town at one 45 and</v>

3642
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:20.760
<v Speaker 2>men's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3643
02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:22.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is what I think.</v>

3644
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:23.493
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3645
02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:28.150
<v Speaker 2>first of all she's fucking terrifying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about like one of the scariest</v>

3646
02:27:28.151 --> 02:27:30.850
<v Speaker 2>female strikers in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyborgs terrifying.</v>

3647
02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:32.860
<v Speaker 2>And Tony and I got in trouble because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3648
02:27:32.861 --> 02:27:34.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said some inappropriate jokes about what</v>

3649
02:27:34.691 --> 02:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>would a roast be like with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All jokes aside.</v>

3650
02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Even before that I had tweeted that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see her in the UFC for</v>

3651
02:27:42.611 --> 02:27:44.020
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The name,</v>

3652
02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:46.450
<v Speaker 2>she's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think also we shouldn't have</v>

3653
02:27:46.451 --> 02:27:49.720
<v Speaker 2>double standards as far as who takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs,</v>

3654
02:27:49.721 --> 02:27:53.650
<v Speaker 2>whether it's for men or for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like things are kind of is,</v>

3655
02:27:53.651 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I think the way people look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what a woman is taking testosterone</v>

3656
02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:58.870
<v Speaker 2>versus a man taking testosterone.</v>

3657
02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3658
02:28:03.251 --> 02:28:04.900
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of the things that men have</v>

3659
02:28:04.901 --> 02:28:07.420
<v Speaker 2>been caught with have been pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural as well.</v>

3660
02:28:07.421 --> 02:28:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Like super human levels of testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't even exist in medical books,</v>

3661
02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:13.470
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3662
02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:17.410
<v Speaker 2>you could argue that it's dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a woman does change her anatomy,</v>

3663
02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're testing her now.</v>

3664
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your anatomy changes.</v>

3665
02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3666
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 2>But you have to make a weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3667
02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3668
02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean it always seen before this holly</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holm things happened and that's all</v>

3669
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:29.150
<v Speaker 2>fishy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's fishy?</v>

3670
02:28:30.290 --> 02:28:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda won't take a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a fight against Holly Holm and</v>

3671
02:28:32.841 --> 02:28:34.190
<v Speaker 2>then it's suddenly like Misha tate when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3672
02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to fight now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3673
02:28:35.470 --> 02:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not necessarily ready to fight</v>

3674
02:28:36.981 --> 02:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3675
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:38.690
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not.</v>

3676
02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:40.690
<v Speaker 2>She can't find until like November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was really,</v>

3677
02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:42.380
<v Speaker 2>she has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got movie obligations.</v>

3678
02:28:42.381 --> 02:28:43.214
<v Speaker 2>They got moved around.</v>

3679
02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>See that's bad right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the movies get in the way of your</v>

3680
02:28:47.961 --> 02:28:50.030
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you got to pick one or the other.</v>

3681
02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Go in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3682
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as my fights over,</v>

3683
02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I can do your movie for the next three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months and then I got her back to</v>

3684
02:28:55.881 --> 02:28:57.940
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be hard though when you're a,</v>

3685
02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:00.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a super celebrity and you're getting all</v>

3686
02:29:00.921 --> 02:29:03.370
<v Speaker 2>this love and everybody wants to put you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all these different things.</v>

3687
02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:05.330
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be hard to say no to certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things obviously.</v>

3688
02:29:05.331 --> 02:29:06.980
<v Speaker 2>But the same shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A female comics.</v>

3689
02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's way worse with a fighter</v>

3690
02:29:09.050 --> 02:29:13.280
<v Speaker 2>because a fighter has to be physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned up to go in to do battle and get</v>

3691
02:29:13.281 --> 02:29:15.170
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're sort of fighter.</v>

3692
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just similar where it's like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not concentrating on the thing that got</v>

3693
02:29:18.111 --> 02:29:18.590
<v Speaker 2>you there.</v>

3694
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that got you there is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

3695
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you just want to do movies.</v>

3696
02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that happens to a lot of comics</v>

3697
02:29:24.711 --> 02:29:25.730
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make it,</v>

3698
02:29:25.731 --> 02:29:28.670
<v Speaker 2>all the sudden you start getting movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>offers and TV show offers up.</v>

3699
02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:29.481
<v Speaker 2>Sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3700
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:31.700
<v Speaker 2>You're um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to spend time in the trenches.</v>

3701
02:29:31.850 --> 02:29:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll work out for two weeks before my</v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

3702
02:29:33.381 --> 02:29:34.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

3703
02:29:34.851 --> 02:29:37.040
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a guy was on a</v>

3704
02:29:37.041 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 2>TV show about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was telling me he was doing a</v>

3705
02:29:38.721 --> 02:29:39.560
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3706
02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:40.773
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When are you doing?</v>

3707
02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.620
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night,</v>

3708
02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew he had been doing like one or two</v>

3709
02:29:44.241 --> 02:29:46.050
<v Speaker 2>sets a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3710
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3711
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:48.360
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3712
02:29:48.370 --> 02:29:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants Julian one or two headlines</v>

3713
02:29:51.771 --> 02:29:52.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a week.</v>

3714
02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he's doing one or two</v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters a week just doing spots.</v>

3715
02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lack of respect for the art</v>

3716
02:29:58.251 --> 02:29:58.971
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3717
02:29:58.971 --> 02:30:01.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not no herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Knowing,</v>

3718
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:02.990
<v Speaker 2>not having done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3719
02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:04.730
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not often done it the right way where</v>

3720
02:30:04.731 --> 02:30:07.160
<v Speaker 2>you feel better and everything's loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3721
02:30:07.161 --> 02:30:09.560
<v Speaker 2>you think I'm doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sets are going well.</v>

3722
02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 2>We've all made the stringing together an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>

3723
02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:14.420
<v Speaker 2>four minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3724
02:30:14.421 --> 02:30:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just to do it the right way,</v>

3725
02:30:18.350 --> 02:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>like the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3726
02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:25.340
<v Speaker 2>I think gives it the most time to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have material that you've</v>

3727
02:30:25.341 --> 02:30:29.180
<v Speaker 2>worked on for a long time and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put a lot of effort into it and then</v>

3728
02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you have to tighten that shit down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a really great comedy shape for</v>

3729
02:30:32.361 --> 02:30:34.130
<v Speaker 2>about two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

3730
02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I think you need two solid months of</v>
<v Speaker 2>every weekend.</v>

3731
02:30:37.010 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Smashing it every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two shows,</v>

3732
02:30:39.291 --> 02:30:39.951
<v Speaker 2>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two shows,</v>

3733
02:30:39.951 --> 02:30:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Saturday show on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do spouts during the week.</v>

3734
02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:45.230
<v Speaker 2>And you know what dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel asked me what's the best show to</v>

3735
02:30:45.231 --> 02:30:45.870
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3736
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all the same.</v>

3737
02:30:46.941 --> 02:30:50.090
<v Speaker 2>But if it's my first time on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in two weeks,</v>

3738
02:30:50.490 --> 02:30:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that the Thursday show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first show of the week is not going</v>

3739
02:30:52.911 --> 02:30:55.280
<v Speaker 2>to be the best show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends though.</v>

3740
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:57.080
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure I could get loose and have fun</v>

3741
02:30:57.081 --> 02:31:00.780
<v Speaker 2>doing during the week and how excited</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are to be in San Francisco and if I</v>

3742
02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.080
<v Speaker 2>just performed a Thursday through</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunday,</v>

3743
02:31:03.081 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the week before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is the only three days later.</v>

3744
02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'All can be sharp.</v>

3745
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:07.880
<v Speaker 2>But if it's been a few weeks and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3746
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:10.880
<v Speaker 2>but by Saturday of that week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I'm on fire.</v>

3747
02:31:11.390 --> 02:31:14.570
<v Speaker 2>And there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing Thursday night.</v>

3748
02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:18.920
<v Speaker 2>If you are coming off of a weekend run</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like three,</v>

3749
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:24.170
<v Speaker 2>five weekends in a row and you're on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire like one of a whenever.</v>

3750
02:31:24.390 --> 02:31:26.550
<v Speaker 2>One of the times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only time I've ever gone on a real</v>

3751
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:29.700
<v Speaker 2>tour was when I did that thing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Murphy and half Ron and we did</v>

3752
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:32.880
<v Speaker 2>that real men of comedy maximum thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that thing,</v>

3753
02:31:32.881 --> 02:31:37.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did 22 or 23 dates and you're just</v>

3754
02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:39.050
<v Speaker 2>doing show after show after show after</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

3755
02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get like a,</v>

3756
02:31:40.970 --> 02:31:43.110
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking Samurai sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3757
02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:46.020
<v Speaker 2>The blade just gets folded down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>polished.</v>

3758
02:31:46.021 --> 02:31:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And now imagine if you took off half</v>
<v Speaker 2>those days to go shoot a movie,</v>

3759
02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.510
<v Speaker 2>how would your final shows up on most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those days?</v>

3760
02:31:51.511 --> 02:31:52.344
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3761
02:31:52.380 --> 02:31:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no way,</v>

3762
02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's like everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else.</v>

3763
02:31:55.561 --> 02:31:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't become a world champion</v>

3764
02:31:57.181 --> 02:32:00.030
<v Speaker 2>fighter without dedicating your life to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3765
02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:03.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't become a great musician</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a lot of rehearsal and a lot of</v>

3766
02:32:03.631 --> 02:32:04.980
<v Speaker 2>planning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much you're going to prep before</v>

3767
02:32:04.981 --> 02:32:05.460
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3768
02:32:05.460 --> 02:32:07.470
<v Speaker 2>how many weeks in a row before your next</v>
<v Speaker 2>special you're gonna go,</v>

3769
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:08.250
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

3770
02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:10.530
<v Speaker 2>No less than no less than eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3771
02:32:10.531 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never t I'm not,</v>

3772
02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I've taken like vacations or it took a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation last week,</v>

3773
02:32:15.121 --> 02:32:19.470
<v Speaker 2>which I wrote when I was on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I think those vacation plans,</v>

3774
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I think those vacation</v>

3775
02:32:21.871 --> 02:32:23.400
<v Speaker 2>times where I know I'm not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform it,</v>

3776
02:32:23.401 --> 02:32:26.730
<v Speaker 2>I just write my thoughts down with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure just to fuck around.</v>

3777
02:32:26.731 --> 02:32:31.020
<v Speaker 2>And I get ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get little seeds that grow from those</v>

3778
02:32:31.021 --> 02:32:32.510
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3779
02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:35.490
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those introspective sit down moments on</v>

3780
02:32:35.491 --> 02:32:38.800
<v Speaker 2>the beach be presented right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to tap this,</v>

3781
02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:40.830
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have to be presented to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience right now.</v>

3782
02:32:40.831 --> 02:32:44.520
<v Speaker 2>So you have two or three days to form</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts fully and really go into</v>

3783
02:32:44.521 --> 02:32:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it five days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

3784
02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:47.870
<v Speaker 2>My point being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3785
02:32:48.450 --> 02:32:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not taking any time off besides</v>

3786
02:32:51.451 --> 02:32:53.040
<v Speaker 2>like having a little vacation time.</v>

3787
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Even when I had a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back and I did,</v>

3788
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I gave back on my vacation on Thursday</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and I was performing Friday and</v>

3789
02:32:58.261 --> 02:33:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night and went right back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3790
02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:02.310
<v Speaker 2>and I'm doing two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three shows a night.</v>

3791
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing them a different clubs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving around and then I'm gonna run the</v>

3792
02:33:04.861 --> 02:33:06.390
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

3793
02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>you've got to stay sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta,</v>

3794
02:33:07.531 --> 02:33:11.700
<v Speaker 2>you gotta bear down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the last run I accept no less than</v>

3795
02:33:11.701 --> 02:33:14.550
<v Speaker 2>two months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every week.</v>

3796
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the road every week somewhere.</v>

3797
02:33:17.311 --> 02:33:19.410
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be the Irvine Improv.</v>

3798
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:21.850
<v Speaker 2>It could be Ontario do an hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3799
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying seven straight weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then fill them on the eighth.</v>

3800
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're not going to take I sometimes</v>

3801
02:33:27.901 --> 02:33:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I should like take the</v>

3802
02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:34.980
<v Speaker 2>week off before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when Thursday comes wherever I'm</v>

3803
02:33:34.981 --> 02:33:36.360
<v Speaker 2>doing a cap city in October.</v>

3804
02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:39.540
<v Speaker 2>But like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do have a little freshness to it,</v>

3805
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:41.940
<v Speaker 2>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the right way.</v>

3806
02:33:41.941 --> 02:33:44.430
<v Speaker 2>And I also want to do like a garbage</v>
<v Speaker 2>club the week before that</v>

3807
02:33:46.090 --> 02:33:48.510
<v Speaker 2>c level room where I won't have fans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just like,</v>

3808
02:33:48.511 --> 02:33:51.360
<v Speaker 2>let me test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me failure where you go as long as</v>

3809
02:33:51.361 --> 02:33:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you put it online and dealer fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daisy just lower percentage,</v>

3810
02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:58.740
<v Speaker 2>just like I don't have a drug as people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3811
02:33:59.850 --> 02:34:03.030
<v Speaker 2>he felt for Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those people,</v>

3812
02:34:03.690 --> 02:34:05.940
<v Speaker 2>they're not on the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3813
02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different for everybody.</v>

3814
02:34:08.941 --> 02:34:10.230
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to do eight straight</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

3815
02:34:10.231 --> 02:34:11.070
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be,</v>

3816
02:34:11.071 --> 02:34:13.410
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to be fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to,</v>

3817
02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:15.600
<v Speaker 2>I think you could also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>during the weekdays I got to do like ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>house sets and or Tuesday night.</v>

3819
02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:22.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like do not just store sets but do</v>

3820
02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>long sets during the week too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to hammer it down man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you'll know if it's,</v>

3962
02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So singular and anger he brings to it</v>

3963
02:40:08.161 --> 02:40:08.994
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3964
02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Charlie's angels came out,</v>

3965
02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:13.400
<v Speaker 2>they used to,</v>

02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Eventually I got the plastic ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had them up there.</v>

3971
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:25.520
<v Speaker 3>It's only for the comedians to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3972
02:40:25.521 --> 02:40:27.390
<v Speaker 3>If they want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you did and he goes,</v>

02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:29.700
<v Speaker 3>he's childish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that movie because it gets</v>

3974
02:40:29.701 --> 02:40:32.160
<v Speaker 3>women the false impression that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I am a 220 pound former crack addict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former marine.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it takes the fucking ashtray.</v>

3977
02:40:38.490 --> 02:40:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just slams it.</v>

3978
02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:41.760
<v Speaker 3>I will close it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just shatters.</v>

3979
02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:46.240
<v Speaker 3>He destroyed a giant glass ashtray</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage and it's,</v>

3980
02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:47.490
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not funny.</v>

3981
02:40:47.491 --> 02:40:49.370
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's talking about beating women that</v>

3982
02:40:49.371 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 3>you have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a character,</v>

3983
02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:54.600
<v Speaker 3>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll break character occasionally and</v>

3984
02:40:54.601 --> 02:40:57.030
<v Speaker 3>giggle and laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he goes back into it.</v>

3985
02:40:57.240 --> 02:40:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lack of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he almost,</v>

3988
02:41:02.191 --> 02:41:05.880
<v Speaker 3>he would do sometimes bad jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real stock jokes so he could get</v>

3989
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:07.830
<v Speaker 3>mad at the crap for not laughing at</v>

<v Speaker 3>just his own stock jokes.</v>

3991
02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd get mad at the craft or not the</v>
