<v Speaker 4>then you would start to get these like,</v>

121
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 to $50 Mc spots where you were </v>

122
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.621
<v Speaker 4>driving the headliner somewhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>jump past all that shit because they </v>

123
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:33.211
<v Speaker 4>would send you out to feature and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>headliners couldn't follow you because </v>

124
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 4>you were out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you were nuts and uh,</v>

125
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:41.401
<v Speaker 4>and so they had to headline you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you started working like the d rooms </v>

126
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:41.401
<v Speaker 4>but headlining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

127
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 4>so you started to get an hour together </v>
<v Speaker 4>super fast.</v>

128
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>

129
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 2>had to sink or swim those times when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular we'd make agreements to steal </v>

130
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 2>each other's shit.</v>

131
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.610
<v Speaker 3>We're bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

132
00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got my whole act.</v>

133
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.820
<v Speaker 3>If you're eating pick up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel free to just had.</v>

134
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 3>He would come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do that.</v>

135
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 3>Blow job jokes hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to peabody,</v>

136
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you might want to wait on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

137
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.260
<v Speaker 3>he gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He let the heat die out of that joke.</v>

138
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.320
<v Speaker 3>It was fun for us because we knew we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

139
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of us should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a point in time where both of </v>

140
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.510
<v Speaker 3>us were doing like middling gigs and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>really didn't have the time.</v>

141
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.730
<v Speaker 3>We really didn't have a real solid half </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

142
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were.</v>

143
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 2>When you're a young comic and you slip </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning of your set,</v>

144
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 2>like the odds of you pulling stuff out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the firearm.</v>

145
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time I was having a good </v>

146
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.760
<v Speaker 3>set and I knocked over a drink and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't address it.</v>

147
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.700
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The audience turned on me,</v>

148
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.450
<v Speaker 3>does indeed smell blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew I was scared.</v>

149
00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:45.180
<v Speaker 3>They knew I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was killing it there.</v>

150
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 4>It's all about their uncomfort and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>denied.</v>

151
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.880
<v Speaker 4>I remember being on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was probably the cruelest thing </v>

152
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.880
<v Speaker 4>anybody ever did to me when I was on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

153
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.880
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

154
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.800
<v Speaker 4>half filled room back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was always like the back of a Chinese</v>

155
00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:01.801
<v Speaker 4>restaurant where they had a banquet room</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they just put a microphone up and </v>

156
00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:05.260
<v Speaker 4>call it a comedy night and I'm up there </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking it and I'm not acknowledging that</v>

157
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm tanking it and during one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>silences that should've had laughed,</v>

158
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:12.190
<v Speaker 4>rented after one of my jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard this middle aged woman whispered</v>

159
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:17.191
<v Speaker 4>to her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could hear a whisper and she just </v>

160
00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:17.191
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the poor bastard.</v>

161
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse than any heckle.</v>

162
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

163
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.030
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

164
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>it would be real hard when we'd watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

165
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:38.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch a friend eat dick in the </v>

166
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:38.661
<v Speaker 2>beginning too because you know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating it,</v>

167
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some times where you know,</v>

168
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:46.101
<v Speaker 2>this guy is not going to pull himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this and he has 15 more minutes </v>

169
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 2>to go watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slosh through.</v>

170
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Is there a way out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you.</v>

171
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.920
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

172
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 3>do you just have to stop or do you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>material?</v>

173
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 3>That's where we come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where we'd steal.</v>

174
00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I did a great job.</v>

175
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I knew that they were grenades that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had in my waistband,</v>

176
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Josie instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would take the top off and lob it </v>

177
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.740
<v Speaker 3>and you're back in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would help each other</v>

178
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.890
<v Speaker 2>time where I was headlining where I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>no fucking business headline and there </v>

179
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.821
<v Speaker 2>was no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely had 40 minutes and they were </v>

180
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:22.091
<v Speaker 2>letting me headline these rooms and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to stretch it all out and if </v>

181
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>something went wrong it went wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hard hats,</v>

182
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 2>there's no better motivation to creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>new material.</v>

183
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:30.791
<v Speaker 2>Then when you make those shows happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just fucking have to get to </v>

184
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you need more weapons.</v>

185
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went into weapons too quick.</v>

186
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 2>You're up there dying.</v>

187
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 4>Especially like you can do the hour when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going well.</v>

188
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 4>You can take that one bit and you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretch it out,</v>

189
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 4>add shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

190
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:46.911
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing improvisational jazz and </v>

191
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:46.911
<v Speaker 4>that our fills out when they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

192
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden it's like concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything shrinks down and now what you</v>

193
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:55.651
<v Speaker 4>had as 35 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just ripped through and 17 and now </v>

194
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 4>you're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're tense and then you got nowhere</v>

195
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:01.180
<v Speaker 4>to go except the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you start fucking with the craft.</v>

196
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 4>They don't like you now did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they don't like you,</v>

197
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.900
<v Speaker 4>you're not making them comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's not like a nice flow of </v>

198
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 4>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so yeah,</v>

199
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 4>the early can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing about Boston is,</v>

200
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 4>and I think it was kind of unique to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of a common other comedy cities,</v>

201
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a punchline town.</v>

202
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.800
<v Speaker 4>It's Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

203
00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

204
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to see something </v>

205
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 4>esoteric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to see a storyteller.</v>

206
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 4>They want you to grab them and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>smack them around and then walk off </v>

207
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 4>stage with your hands in the air.</v>

208
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

209
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.120
<v Speaker 5>there were guys that were doing it that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're so good at the best.</v>

210
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.460
<v Speaker 5>We came up with an error where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

211
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.550
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about this 100 times on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast and people always go,</v>

212
00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:40.030
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

213
00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:45.031
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that were really good comedians </v>

214
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:46.561
<v Speaker 5>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people even understand </v>

215
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:46.561
<v Speaker 5>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a.</v>

216
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 5>It was like a utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston was like this standup comedy </v>

217
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.160
<v Speaker 5>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was at one point in time there was</v>

218
00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:53.590
<v Speaker 5>five clubs in a tiny little area,</v>

219
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.980
<v Speaker 4>seven nights a week club.</v>

220
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.900
<v Speaker 5>I remember there was just that one block</v>
<v Speaker 5>of warranty warranty.</v>

221
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.660
<v Speaker 5>It was nick's comedy stop and then there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was duck soup,</v>

222
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.910
<v Speaker 4>comedy connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then Mike,</v>

223
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Mike Clark had the comedy club and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles Play House above the company,</v>

224
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 4>and then on the weekends you cut over to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick tardies,</v>

225
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:11.380
<v Speaker 4>comedy vault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right over there,</v>

226
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.420
<v Speaker 4>two yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's craziness and then you get in your </v>

227
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.291
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drove down the stitches on common </v>

<v Speaker 4>and those were for short sets.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seven minutes with a big clubs.</v>

00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:37.330
<v Speaker 4>20 minute set for free all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we go to Hartford one night,</v>

236
00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:39.490
<v Speaker 4>then we go to worcester one night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we go to Maine.</v>

237
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.390
<v Speaker 4>One night we would go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd give especially a longer set,</v>

238
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were lucky enough to come up in a </v>

239
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.110
<v Speaker 4>time where the word comedy in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>place drew a crowd.</v>

240
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 4>You didn't need to have a big name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just were comedy crazy and we just </v>

241
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.701
<v Speaker 4>happened to be dropped in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a city that was a closed system.</v>

242
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have headliners come in from</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of town,</v>

243
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 4>so the local,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were four or five big local </v>

244
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.740
<v Speaker 4>headliners that drew and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>club's.</v>

245
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise they only booked based on do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you crush?</v>

246
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Are you funny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you original?</v>

247
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 4>So it was a meritocracy and no one ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought they were going to get famous </v>

248
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What career,</v>

249
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>if someone used the word career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would have looked at them </v>

250
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>confused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

251
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

252
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.020
<v Speaker 5>All anyone wanted to do was become a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boston comma.</v>

253
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.410
<v Speaker 5>It's like the fame that you wanted was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just the being accepted amongst your </v>

254
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Speaker 5>peers and having crowds coming to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

255
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.650
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

256
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.730
<v Speaker 4>Never really expect to see you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think wasn't until later.</v>

257
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I think for us it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

258
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when your first fucking a girl </v>

259
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 4>and you can't believe she's letting you </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck her after jerking off for three </v>

260
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.190
<v Speaker 4>straight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was like when I was doing</v>

261
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:53.191
<v Speaker 4>standup in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're allowing me these stages that </v>

262
00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 4>I've watched since I was a teenager in </v>
<v Speaker 4>awe.</v>

263
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 4>All the sudden I'm on it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>letting me talk.</v>

264
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all I needed.</v>

265
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first guys I ever saw do a </v>

266
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.420
<v Speaker 2>live set was tom cotter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cod is one of the first guys.</v>

267
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a buddy from Boston is a great guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was in like some sort of.</v>

268
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.880
<v Speaker 2>The first time I ever went on some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an open mic night and,</v>

269
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.820
<v Speaker 2>and he was like the first guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone on stage.</v>

270
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.170
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

271
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a not.</v>

272
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 4>He had started maybe two years ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

273
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.160
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always used to bum me out and the </v>

274
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.060
<v Speaker 2>reason we used to bum me out because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so fucking funny to hang out with,</v>

275
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:34.410
<v Speaker 2>but he wanted to take it down a notch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to like,</v>

276
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

277
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.290
<v Speaker 2>maybe I shouldn't go so dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should.</v>

278
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.810
<v Speaker 2>And you wanted to go do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's you when you're at your best,</v>

279
00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you're a pervert.</v>

280
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 4>They twist the crazy twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is one of the most twisted dudes and </v>

281
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:48.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather have him on.</v>

282
00:12:48.661 --> 00:12:51.660
<v Speaker 4>We should have him on and do it together</v>
<v Speaker 4>because his stories,</v>

283
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.230
<v Speaker 4>the shit that he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

284
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say it on the air,</v>

285
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.180
<v Speaker 4>what I can say anything on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Shit Tom cotter did,</v>

286
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the first guys I know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would walk around with his balls hanging</v>

287
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:08.731
<v Speaker 2>out of his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the first guys like no one was </v>

288
00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:11.491
<v Speaker 2>doing that back when we were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were like 21 or whatever the hell we </v>

289
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:11.491
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Tom Clark is walking around with his</v>

290
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:12.170
<v Speaker 2>balls hanging out of his pants.</v>

291
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Jesus man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be a Christmas party and all the </v>

292
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.080
<v Speaker 4>comics were there and he and he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the hands on his hips still.</v>

293
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.640
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like he was hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

294
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.350
<v Speaker 4>And I remember at one point we were at </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody's house and there was a dog.</v>

295
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 4>It was a oliver's dog and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had rescued one of those greyhounds.</v>

296
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.410
<v Speaker 4>I think Tom was putting a dill pickle up</v>
<v Speaker 4>its ass in the middle of the party.</v>

297
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Like we were both beyond children.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was the part of the fun of having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like Tom cotter too,</v>

300
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 2>is because you knew that he would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something like that.</v>

301
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.980
<v Speaker 2>You knew he would want up things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew if there was a bunch of comics </v>

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.121
<v Speaker 2>something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like he kind of pulled </v>

<v Speaker 4>suddenly burnt down in the middle of a </v>

311

<v Speaker 4>wet summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're up there and we're staying.</v>

00:14:38.391 --> 00:14:38.760
<v Speaker 4>the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I opened the gate and I walk in and it's</v>

320
00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:43.761
<v Speaker 4>packed in there on the far end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pool and I make it about halfway down </v>

321
00:14:43.761 --> 00:14:43.830
<v Speaker 4>the pool and they both stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>start screaming.</v>

326
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.130
<v Speaker 6>a pair of shorts and boxer shorts.</v>

327
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:11.130
<v Speaker 6>that point.</v>

<v Speaker 6>get a lock her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were just grabbing your own balls.</v>

349
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.610

<v Speaker 6>Only work in the head.</v>

350
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 6>A lot of twisty shit on the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go overhand on it.</v>

351
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.200
<v Speaker 6>A lot of weird twisty shit on the head.</v>

352
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As spitting on it.</v>

353
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 4>And so then so then she brings me on and</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course I have to say it in front of </v>

354
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.081
<v Speaker 4>the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just saw her in her underwear and I </v>

355
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:24.420
<v Speaker 4>can't really speak and so she came on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>show and I was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

357
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it had been a bathing suit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't have struck me,</v>

358
00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:32.091
<v Speaker 4>but seeing somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially my favorite thing is strip </v>

359
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.391
<v Speaker 4>clubs do nothing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I happen to see a woman naked </v>

360
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:35.550
<v Speaker 4>through window and an apartment,</v>

<v Speaker 6>know there's like five camera men in </v>

365
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:48.210
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd rather have like,</v>

366
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.140
<v Speaker 6>like stolen laptop porn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

367
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:53.460
<v Speaker 6>where it's or like ex boyfriend getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>revenge by sitting out photos and videos</v>

368
00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:55.350
<v Speaker 6>of like his ex girlfriend and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what I need.</v>

369
00:16:55.351 --> 00:17:00.351
<v Speaker 6>I need realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Same reason why I can't watch like a TV </v>

370
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:00.660
<v Speaker 6>show at the laugh track.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like it's fake,</v>

371
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like of course we'll have</v>

<v Speaker 4>my new favorite porn which is the </v>

373
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.720
<v Speaker 4>casting couch stuff.</v>

374
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.250
<v Speaker 6>Casting couch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you can't even believe that,</v>

375
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>

376
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.830
<v Speaker 6>That is not fake because they'll say it </v>
<v Speaker 6>to greg.</v>

377
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.730
<v Speaker 6>There's two moments.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Moments</v>

378
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.790
<v Speaker 4>I look for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

379
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.010
<v Speaker 4>One is the hello when they come in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see if there's a cause.</v>

380
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I studied acting and we spent fucking </v>

381
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.201
<v Speaker 4>six months on answering a door in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scene and how you react to not knowing </v>

382
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:29.700
<v Speaker 4>what's on the other side of the door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening it and then is it real.</v>

383
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I look for that and then the moment that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes from I'm here to do like a,</v>

384
00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:37.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a topless photo shoot too.</v>

385
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.930
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to suck my Dick.</v>

386
00:17:39.931 --> 00:17:40.860
<v Speaker 4>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.230
<v Speaker 4>you'll make a thousand to $5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>

388
00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm the producer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I make the tape,</v>

389
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 4>I send it to the buyers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

390
00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:51.351
<v Speaker 4>it goes through me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to see if you can follow </v>

391
00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:51.351
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the girls,</v>

392
00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:51.351
<v Speaker 4>she's online.</v>

393
00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 7>She wants a job too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the money.</v>

394
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:56.391
<v Speaker 7>All the sudden the fucking morality goes</v>
<v Speaker 7>way down and then the moment always </v>

395
00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:58.200
<v Speaker 7>builds to where he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now I want you to suck my dick.</v>

396
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 7>And you see them go fucking vacant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see their eyes just go like what?</v>

397
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 7>And I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know what those real.</v>

398
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.801
<v Speaker 7>They have to have sex test before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like std tests before they have to have </v>

399
00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 7>paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have to have a location shoot,</v>

400
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 7>but given by the city to have a permit </v>
<v Speaker 7>to shoot in Arizona.</v>

401
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But they still have to have tests.</v>

402
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 7>Notes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>friend.</v>

403
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.360
<v Speaker 7>My friend is the head of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the Health Department of,</v>

404
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of California.</v>

405
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

406
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 7>he's the head of stds and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 7>fighting,</v>

407
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:33.501
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they had a big breakthrough last week </v>

408
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:33.501
<v Speaker 7>where they have to wear condoms and in </v>
<v Speaker 7>La county now,</v>

409
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 7>how could you call that a breakthrough </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it's a workplace.</v>

410
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:40.521
<v Speaker 7>People should not die of AIDS in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>workplace that's legal and it's more </v>

411
00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:45.321
<v Speaker 7>realistic that they're wearing condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I feel that they're allowed </v>

412
00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 7>to take it off and still do the khaki </v>
<v Speaker 7>shots to the face.</v>

413
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.390
<v Speaker 7>They can freestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't give you a right?</v>

414
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Would you take aids written loads on </v>

415
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:54.980
<v Speaker 7>your face?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

416
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.770
<v Speaker 7>it depends on the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if the guy was white or black,</v>

417
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.930
<v Speaker 7>there's a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a couple of things you've </v>

418
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 7>located before the white black thing.</v>

419
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's the thing.</v>

420
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 7>Put your money where your mouth is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

421
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 7>it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

422
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:23.181
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I absolutely agree with testing and all </v>

423
00:19:23.181 --> 00:19:25.431
<v Speaker 7>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I don't want to watch porn and </v>

424

426
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.250
<v Speaker 7>If they're going to do a test for me to </v>
<v Speaker 7>feel good about porn,</v>

427
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 7>I want to know that her parents are no </v>
<v Speaker 7>longer living.</v>

428
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to know that there's a day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to.</v>

429
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:40.010
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to know that there's a dad </v>
<v Speaker 7>out there that might see this on the </v>

430
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 7>bluffs thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to know is that she's doing </v>

431
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 7>because she didn't have the love of her </v>
<v Speaker 7>parents and the parents are dead.</v>

432
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 7>That's the first thing I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>think of.</v>

433
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 7>And then it's a boner killer right </v>

<v Speaker 7>while you're jerking off,</v>

436
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 7>her dad's jerking off finds the clip.</v>

437
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 7>Can you imagine jerking off and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>your daughter pops up?</v>

438
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 7>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that a suicide moment?</v>

439
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.580
<v Speaker 7>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What was the.</v>

440
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 7>Cause you've already got the erection.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not like you stumbled on it.</v>

441
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 7>Flacid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're rock hard.</v>

442
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.600
<v Speaker 7>You change clips as we do and then and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then it pops up your daughter naked </v>

<v Speaker 7>having sex.</v>

<v Speaker 7>get mad at somebody.</v>

463
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 7>What have you came and it was your best </v>
<v Speaker 7>orgasm ever.</v>

464
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.590
<v Speaker 7>You realize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's the kind of nirvana that if you</v>

465
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:16.591
<v Speaker 7>can't get back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know what you're chasing the </v>

466
00:21:16.591 --> 00:21:18.841
<v Speaker 7>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to keep chasing that dragon </v>

467
00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:20.600
<v Speaker 7>dragon's your daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would you do in your daughter shot,</v>

468
00:21:20.601 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 7>but you can only be shocked</v>

469
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>by at once unless you just became a </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak and you were into watching your </v>

470
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked.</v>

471
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.410
<v Speaker 7>That's like the seventies porn movies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was always like the preacher dad and </v>

472
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.280
<v Speaker 7>his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They used to go fucking like,</v>

473
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.650
<v Speaker 7>do you watch Dave's old porn at all on </v>
<v Speaker 7>showtime.</v>

474
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:39.651
<v Speaker 7>David tells you haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's him watching classical porn with </v>

475
00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:43.041
<v Speaker 7>the actress from it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I watched one of them and it was </v>

476
00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:45.861
<v Speaker 7>like it was a preacher dad and he ends </v>
<v Speaker 7>up hitting on his daughter and seducing </v>

477
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:50.541
<v Speaker 7>her and then they fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what a lot of those movies </v>

478
00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:52.911
<v Speaker 7>where they were really at a pole and </v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a lot of like rapey stuff and </v>

479
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:53.520
<v Speaker 7>repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

480
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.120
<v Speaker 7>Rapey not full on rate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

481
00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how times have changed </v>

482
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to treating women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was something,</v>

483
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that j Edgar Hoover show </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie rather with Leonardo Dicaprio.</v>

484
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the most interesting aspects </v>

485
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.631
<v Speaker 2>of it as how the g man before the g man </v>
<v Speaker 2>became like the symbol that everybody </v>

486
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:23.741
<v Speaker 2>wanted to achieve and everybody wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be at Gmail is young kids growing up </v>

487
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:26.150
<v Speaker 2>before it was like James Cagney playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like these gangsters,</v>

488
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 7>white hate anyone always like smushed </v>
<v Speaker 7>something in the girl's face or slapper </v>

489
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.950
<v Speaker 7>in the phase and like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey guys would be laughing.</v>

490
00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.790
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

491
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:39.791
<v Speaker 7>like look at all the violence that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>would do to women who have like regular </v>

492
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:42.600
<v Speaker 7>women would say something crazy and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>went to the moon.</v>

493
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.630
<v Speaker 7>Everybody was cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like they were the men that were </v>

494
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.630
<v Speaker 7>taking control.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The situation.</v>

495
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.850
<v Speaker 7>Like she needed a smack right there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

496
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.210
<v Speaker 7>She had something like you were helping </v>
<v Speaker 7>her.</v>

497
00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:51.770
<v Speaker 7>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she had lost it.</v>

498
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.770
<v Speaker 7>They were helping her get back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I remember something quiet man with</v>

499
00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:57.560
<v Speaker 7>John Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember there was like his wife was a,</v>

500
00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.410
<v Speaker 7>his brother was supposed to give him a </v>
<v Speaker 7>dowery and he didn't.</v>

501
00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 7>And he fucking drags through the fields </v>
<v Speaker 7>by her hair slapping her and the crap </v>

502
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.050
<v Speaker 7>towns cheering and you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's like a feel good movie and </v>

503
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.191
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>happy that he's finally standing up to </v>

504
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 7>his wife and Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember high plains</v>

505
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.680
<v Speaker 2>drifter when he raped the chicken barn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wayne,</v>

506
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Clint Eastwood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clint Eastwood rape the Chicken Barn.</v>

507
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the way he treated her,</v>

508
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.020
<v Speaker 7>that's what guys used to do would hold a</v>
<v Speaker 7>girl down,</v>

509
00:23:24.021 --> 00:23:27.380
<v Speaker 7>pull her pants down and just fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they could get away with it,</v>

510
00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:29.570
<v Speaker 7>if no one was around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that is what they would do.</v>

511
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.650
<v Speaker 7>It occurred to me the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are we the only species that doesn't </v>

512
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.480
<v Speaker 7>just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

513
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.200
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is there.</v>

514
00:23:36.201 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 7>Is there sex between any other animals </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's consensual or is it all over?</v>

515
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.140
<v Speaker 7>Is there's one animal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't remember what it is right now.</v>

516
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.660
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Coursers.</v>

517
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 7>We're get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they</v>

518
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 5>do in our study too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just don't want to get fucked by </v>

519
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v Speaker 5>all the men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hence the problem.</v>

520
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.701
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that there's judgement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that it's not that that </v>

521
00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:57.850
<v Speaker 5>people in this I don't want to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't find people on that side willing </v>

522
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:57.850
<v Speaker 5>to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what it is.</v>

523
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Just there's a lot of judgment going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were deciding,</v>

524
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 5>now I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

525
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:03.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't want you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want some Dick.</v>

526
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 5>They just don't want your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that gets people angry.</v>

527
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 5>Hence the rapey.</v>

528
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.430
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's sociological.</v>

529
00:24:09.431 --> 00:24:10.510
<v Speaker 4>It's not biological.</v>

530
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 5>There's this biological and sociological</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it was purely biological.</v>

531
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 5>It could all be cured with masturbation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a sociological aspect to it that</v>

532
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 5>women are not attracted to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get angry.</v>

533
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 5>You want to force yourself on them </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's what you want.</v>

534
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.790
<v Speaker 5>You want them to want you to fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to fuck you.</v>

535
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.800
<v Speaker 5>You're gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your gross to them.</v>

536
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 6>So whoever we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rapist,</v>

537
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.920
<v Speaker 6>you're not a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

538
00:24:32.921 --> 00:24:34.030
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

539
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 6>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

540
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:39.760
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's more psychological and sociological</v>

541
00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 6>than it even is physiological unless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

542
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.760
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's not rape.</v>

543
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.850
<v Speaker 6>If you like holding a girl down with </v>
<v Speaker 6>your stubs and you're fucking her.</v>

544
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.800
<v Speaker 6>You heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

545
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.840
<v Speaker 6>You can't masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is the only reason you're just </v>

546
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:55.840
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

547
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:55.840
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to rape anybody,</v>

548
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 6>but I got to do what I gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gotta think you</v>

549
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.670
<v Speaker 4>right by a guy with no arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you really trying not to be raped?</v>

550
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.080
<v Speaker 5>I bet you there's a lot of dudes with </v>
<v Speaker 5>norms that could rape the fuck out of </v>

551
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.620
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Real strong ones like farmhand guys,</v>

552
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 5>just to stubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a big guy with a thick thighs.</v>

553
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 5>God knows how to Pitney Down with his.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

554
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:20.050
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does he put his Dick in me or they are </v>

555
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.630
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the arm is just loosening your </v>

556
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.270
<v Speaker 5>asshole up for his car because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>how big his car.</v>

557
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.140
<v Speaker 6>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how about that?</v>

558
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.960
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a terrific movie.</v>

559
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.710
<v Speaker 6>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

560
00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 6>this guy is going to use this to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>

561
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna ruin it for the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

562
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 6>the penis and you're not looking back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know if it's the arm of the </v>

563
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 6>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't even care.</v>

564
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.610
<v Speaker 6>You're milking a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just loving it.</v>

565
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.100
<v Speaker 6>Just so happy that you're not in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>mom's care anymore.</v>

566
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.240
<v Speaker 6>So I love this summer outreach programs.</v>

567
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.310
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a.</v>

568
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.500
<v Speaker 4>It is interesting though because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the whole feminist movement was</v>

569
00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:57.501
<v Speaker 4>saying that rape was a crime of power </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not a crime of biology,</v>

570
00:25:57.601 --> 00:26:02.601
<v Speaker 4>but then kind of now the new thinking on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it by the postmodern feminists is that,</v>

571
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.530
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was bullshit that no,</v>

572
00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:08.910
<v Speaker 4>it is men get horny and it is partially </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying that it is about,</v>

573
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been rejected and I'm more </v>

574
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 4>physically powerful so I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>

575
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.020
<v Speaker 4>but that there is also like guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so fucking wired for sex and </v>

576
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.821
<v Speaker 4>something's off and that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about the physical act of sex as </v>

577
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:23.730
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not purely one or the other.</v>

578
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a broad spectrum,</v>

579
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 5>a lot of reasons to rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

580
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

581
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.490
<v Speaker 5>it's just one more bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One more example of people trying to get</v>

582
00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:35.170
<v Speaker 5>people to do things that they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

583
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.940
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that like to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

584
00:26:36.941 --> 00:26:39.520
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that like to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like to be the boss.</v>

585
00:26:39.521 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 5>They like to get people to do things </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to do,</v>

586
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 5>like to yell at people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They to,</v>

587
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

588
00:26:43.901 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 5>there's</v>

589
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:49.060
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that would love </v>

590
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.060
<v Speaker 2>to be a cop just so they could yell at </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

591
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of judgment going on with human </v>

592
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

593
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And religion is um,</v>

594
00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:01.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a manifestation of that are the </v>

595
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:01.090
<v Speaker 4>cause of that?</v>

596
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:01.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a manifestation I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every,</v>

597
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.900
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody would make something up.</v>

598
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I think we're always looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

599
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:10.001
<v Speaker 2>we look so hard for someone to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers that it's almost impossible for </v>

600
00:27:10.001 --> 00:27:11.750
<v Speaker 2>someone with a big ego to not take </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>

601
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:17.110
<v Speaker 2>So some crazy dude would come along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answers all of a sudden and then </v>

602
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.110
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a new religion.</v>

603
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.470
<v Speaker 2>So our longing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

604
00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>it's like we have an amazing ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>control our environment right now,</v>

605
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:23.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

606
00:27:23.681 --> 00:27:28.681
<v Speaker 2>with planes and the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically our physical infrastructure </v>

607
00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:29.030
<v Speaker 2>of our cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing ability,</v>

608
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.650
<v Speaker 2>but yet we're still trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck we're here.</v>

609
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:37.100
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is sex and breeding and what is the</v>

610
00:27:37.101 --> 00:27:42.101
<v Speaker 2>purpose of making more people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm just going to die and everyone </v>

611
00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:42.101
<v Speaker 2>else is going to die eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too late,</v>

612
00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:42.730
<v Speaker 2>what is our purpose here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

613
00:27:42.731 --> 00:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this really all about?</v>

614
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it amazing that that is really the</v>
<v Speaker 4>core.</v>

615
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Those three or four questions you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>asked are there is no close second to </v>

616
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:56.260
<v Speaker 4>importance in questions in life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're the ones you never hear talk.</v>

617
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everyone brings them up,</v>

618
00:27:58.011 --> 00:27:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you belittle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

619
00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:00.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed,</v>

620
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like that,</v>

621
00:28:02.241 --> 00:28:04.520
<v Speaker 2>your breast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't wouldn't want to be you man.</v>

622
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.130
<v Speaker 2>You had a friend who was a very nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

623
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.740
<v Speaker 2>but he's a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

624
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.890
<v Speaker 2>he made Romney and his wife had had </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner with me and they were asking me </v>

625
00:28:13.911 --> 00:28:17.180
<v Speaker 2>about higher powers if I believed in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher power.</v>

626
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.280
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

627
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't not believe adult like </v>
<v Speaker 2>disbelieve.</v>

628
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.930
<v Speaker 2>I've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never been proven to me,</v>

629
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.190
<v Speaker 2>but it means it might be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the woman actually said,</v>

630
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I could sleep if I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

631
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.130
<v Speaker 2>If I had those questions not answered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

632
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:36.620
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what if there was no answer?</v>

633
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.890
<v Speaker 2>What if there really was no answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not like you couldn't get them</v>

634
00:28:39.891 --> 00:28:42.200
<v Speaker 2>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the answer doesn't exist right</v>

635
00:28:42.201 --> 00:28:44.390
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't have access to it.</v>

636
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>So everything else is just speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at a certain point in time,</v>

637
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:51.911
<v Speaker 2>we have to accept that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the fact that he's just too much </v>

638
00:28:51.911 --> 00:28:52.970
<v Speaker 2>evidence that people are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these stories are terrible.</v>

639
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Speaker 2>So you possibly</v>

640
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 4>in most languages is interpreted as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknowable.</v>

641
00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to,</v>

642
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.760
<v Speaker 4>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it puts the onus on you.</v>

643
00:29:01.761 --> 00:29:06.761
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that true spirituality </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out of more of that idea of like </v>

644
00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:11.111
<v Speaker 4>Taoism where there is a nap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is this force of nature that is </v>

645
00:29:11.111 --> 00:29:12.950
<v Speaker 4>positive and flows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by humbling your ego,</v>

646
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.870
<v Speaker 4>you can become a part of that force </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's as close as I think if you really</v>

647
00:29:17.871 --> 00:29:19.640
<v Speaker 4>boil down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most eastern thought,</v>

648
00:29:19.641 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Speaker 4>it comes down to that selflessness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting into a place where the power,</v>

649
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.810
<v Speaker 4>obviously something is making the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flowers bloom,</v>

650
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.810
<v Speaker 4>the sun setting at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the shit that you can count on.</v>

651
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 4>There's a cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a cycle and it.</v>

652
00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:32.900
<v Speaker 4>And it works on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>

653
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.390
<v Speaker 4>on a micro level and a macro level at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

654
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.300
<v Speaker 4>It's all consistent in a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

655
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:39.680
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something.</v>

656
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 4>But then to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

657
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 4>what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is where the bullshit starts.</v>

658
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.880
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to me it always starts with like </v>

659
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:49.880
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a volcano.</v>

660
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.371
<v Speaker 4>People get scared and there's always one</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who is so fucking cocky that he </v>

661
00:29:53.371 --> 00:29:53.740
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's always got a robe.</v>

662
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 4>So he's a guy in a robe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got,</v>

663
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go talk to God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't talk to you.</v>

664
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 4>They'll talk to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he just decides that.</v>

665
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 4>And then he leaves for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes back and go,</v>

666
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.360
<v Speaker 4>here's what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys should give me 10 percent for.</v>

667
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.240
<v Speaker 4>That was his first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this other shit that's going to</v>

668
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:15.241
<v Speaker 4>play kate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All your fears and it's going to make </v>

669
00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:15.241
<v Speaker 4>you ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which will make you feel comfortable.</v>

670
00:30:15.241 --> 00:30:15.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just a pimp game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

671
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 4>it's always been.</v>

672
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.340
<v Speaker 5>There's no answers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what people need to know,</v>

673
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.390
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that there is no god that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

674
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.580
<v Speaker 5>there's absolutely no deity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

675
00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:30.581
<v Speaker 5>There's no intelligence to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>process that I don't believe that </v>

676
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:30.581
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't either.</v>

677
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't see any evidence that there </v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't a very distinctive </v>

678
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.701
<v Speaker 5>mathematical progression to to </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything in the universe and I don't </v>

679
00:30:38.701 --> 00:30:40.610
<v Speaker 5>know if you can say that there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>purpose for that.</v>

680
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you can define if a an </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligent form of life or </v>

681
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.961
<v Speaker 5>consciousness or whatever the fuck it is</v>
<v Speaker 5>created it or if it's just the ethic of </v>

682
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:51.230
<v Speaker 5>the universal things always get more </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated,</v>

683
00:30:51.231 --> 00:30:54.110
<v Speaker 5>including intelligent life in technology</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it just.</v>

684
00:30:54.111 --> 00:30:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Everything will continue to get more </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated.</v>

685
00:30:56.211 --> 00:30:57.920
<v Speaker 5>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how the universe works.</v>

686
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean that might be it.</v>

687
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it,</v>

688
00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 4>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say to people that are </v>

689
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

690
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:06.830
<v Speaker 4>which is the one where you don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in any God at all.</v>

691
00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Not a theist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agnosticism,</v>

692
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:09.340
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

693
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Agnostic is you don't know.</v>

694
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't believe there is a god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

695
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:14.300
<v Speaker 5>I think there's not a god you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>

696
00:31:14.301 --> 00:31:19.301
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Atheism is a lack the needle denial of </v>

697
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:22.310
<v Speaker 5>any lack of a non belief in a deity and </v>
<v Speaker 5>non non theists</v>

698
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.670
<v Speaker 4>atheists I will say too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

699
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:28.240
<v Speaker 4>so then at that means that you're purely</v>
<v Speaker 4>darwinist evolution.</v>

700
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.380
<v Speaker 5>I think you can be an atheist and still </v>
<v Speaker 5>be open to something fucking crazy that </v>

701
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.530
<v Speaker 5>no one's ever considered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just hasn't been proven yet.</v>

702
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any atheism is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>atheist rather is absolutely positive </v>

703
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.550
<v Speaker 5>that when they die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the energy seizes to exist.</v>

704
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.370
<v Speaker 5>They do not pass into another form of </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>

705
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people are saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

706
00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.020
<v Speaker 5>I think what they're saying is that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't buy religion.</v>

707
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not buying the God concept.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not buying the man in the sky.</v>

708
00:31:54.711 --> 00:31:56.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm not buying any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're saying,</v>

709
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.690
<v Speaker 5>and that agnostics are kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>riding the fence on that,</v>

710
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.550
<v Speaker 5>but they don't want to piss people off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're like,</v>

711
00:32:01.551 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

712
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:02.570
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>

713
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.800
<v Speaker 4>sort of in a belief in God the 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you deny that there's any </v>

714
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

715
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was this movie that people hated </v>

716
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 4>that I actually really liked called tree</v>
<v Speaker 4>of life.</v>

717
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was really spacey?</v>

718
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot.</v>

719
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.510
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were no worth 45 minutes.</v>

720
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Speaker 4>And the theme of it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was grades versus nature and it,</v>

721
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.570
<v Speaker 4>it got me thinking a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

722
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.680
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to be a pure </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionists and believe that science </v>

723
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.820
<v Speaker 4>is this thing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an infinite possibilities,</v>

724
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:38.821
<v Speaker 4>we are one possibility and that all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are happening right now are </v>

725
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:43.551
<v Speaker 4>a result of complete freaky but yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>logical science.</v>

726
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Speaker 4>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

727
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 4>if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And evolution is the key,</v>

728
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 4>why do we have handicap ramps?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have welfare?</v>

729
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Why do we have affirmative action?</v>

730
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

731
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:59.411
<v Speaker 4>liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones that believe that there is no </v>

732
00:32:59.411 --> 00:32:59.411
<v Speaker 4>god or that they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

733
00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:03.281
<v Speaker 4>they downplay the God thing and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones that are constantly promoting </v>

734
00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:03.480
<v Speaker 4>what I would call grace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

735
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 4>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kindness doesn't exist in the animal </v>

736
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 4>kingdom is like what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about with rape,</v>

737
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

738
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not raping his kindness because you </v>

739
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 4>could rape but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

740
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Something is in us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's shame sociologically,</v>

741
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:22.210
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at it more in the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>picture of I'm a liberal and yet I am </v>

742
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:28.211
<v Speaker 4>voting against my best interests because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something in me and I don't </v>

743
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:33.221
<v Speaker 4>believe in any prescribed religion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something in me in my gut </v>

744
00:33:33.221 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 4>that feels like Jesus did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

745
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.200
<v Speaker 4>so you can't have both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have evolution and completely </v>

746
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.261
<v Speaker 4>deny that there is some kind of a spirit</v>
<v Speaker 4>within our process as humans that's </v>

747
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.540
<v Speaker 4>guiding us towards something kinder than</v>
<v Speaker 4>complete survival of the fittest.</v>

748
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what the one thing that </v>

749
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 5>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are an animal,</v>

750
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.850
<v Speaker 5>but we're also the next stage of animals</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we're aware of who we are and we </v>

751
00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:05.101
<v Speaker 5>contemplate our existence and when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>contemplate your existence in you're an </v>

752
00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:06.910
<v Speaker 5>intelligent life form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should always be seeking to improve.</v>

753
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:12.450
<v Speaker 5>If you're always seeking to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that you look at it like what has </v>

754
00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:13.360
<v Speaker 5>brought me the most positive results,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's kindness,</v>

755
00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:14.410
<v Speaker 5>it's kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friendship,</v>

756
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.730
<v Speaker 5>the connection with human beings on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very positive level where you like build</v>

757
00:34:18.731 --> 00:34:22.330
<v Speaker 5>up like a trust in you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a warmth and friendship and you</v>

758
00:34:22.331 --> 00:34:27.331
<v Speaker 5>root for each other and you share in </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other's bounty and you you build </v>

759
00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:31.111
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that we all know inherently in </v>

760
00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:34.021
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in our heads that kindness is like one </v>

761
00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:35.500
<v Speaker 5>of the best gifts you can bestow another</v>
<v Speaker 5>human being,</v>

762
00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:40.501
<v Speaker 5>whether it's giving them food when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have any or helping them out or </v>

763
00:34:40.501 --> 00:34:43.441
<v Speaker 5>hooking them up or doing something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>help them just or being around them and </v>

764
00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:44.410
<v Speaker 5>complimenting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

765
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:49.650
<v Speaker 5>We know that inherently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That feels great and we know it when we </v>

766
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.070
<v Speaker 5>know that that's the next we have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to use our resources </v>

767
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.650
<v Speaker 5>together so that we can be like that all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

768
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

769
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.440
<v Speaker 4>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it because I know when I was </v>

770
00:34:59.440 --> 00:34:59.950
<v Speaker 4>younger I would like you super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive,</v>

771
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just look at standup.</v>

772
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean you and I think probably pushed </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves as hard as we possibly could </v>

773
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.300
<v Speaker 4>for about 10 years nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

774
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:12.590
<v Speaker 4>and then I got to a certain age where </v>
<v Speaker 4>like now I appreciate like hanging out </v>

775
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.280
<v Speaker 4>with you today just felt so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

776
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody who has a shared history with </v>

777
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.601
<v Speaker 4>you that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has similar visions on life and things </v>

778
00:35:21.601 --> 00:35:23.530
<v Speaker 4>and that wasn't as important to me when </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in my early twenties.</v>

779
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 4>All I cared about was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>winning I gotTa,</v>

780
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and creatively I enjoyed it all.</v>

781
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:33.691
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think as you get older you start </v>

782
00:35:33.691 --> 00:35:36.391
<v Speaker 4>to really understand what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the kindness and the connection is </v>

783
00:35:36.391 --> 00:35:37.150
<v Speaker 4>where it's all at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at all these studies,</v>

784
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 4>they're doing a lot of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantifiable happiness,</v>

785
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>studies on what brings us happiness.</v>

786
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.730
<v Speaker 4>It always comes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never about money.</v>

787
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's always about doing what you</v>

788
00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:51.971
<v Speaker 5>actually want to be doing with your life</v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as like if you have an inner </v>

789
00:35:51.971 --> 00:35:55.060
<v Speaker 5>creative expression to get out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people who always </v>

790
00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.070
<v Speaker 5>wanted to be singers and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>

791
00:35:55.071 --> 00:36:00.071
<v Speaker 5>never pursued it so they just sing </v>
<v Speaker 5>around their house and they always </v>

792
00:36:00.071 --> 00:36:00.200
<v Speaker 5>wonder what could have been if they just</v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to be a singer.</v>

793
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.140
<v Speaker 5>That's one form of that that could bum </v>
<v Speaker 5>you out.</v>

794
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.320
<v Speaker 5>That's one form of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a roadblock in your life to the </v>

795
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.390
<v Speaker 5>depressed feeling that you didn't try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't try to reach your potential.</v>

796
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.060
<v Speaker 5>You didn't go after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is intriguing to you?</v>

797
00:36:14.061 --> 00:36:19.061
<v Speaker 5>Like we all have almost like a beacon </v>
<v Speaker 5>that pulls us in a certain direction </v>

798
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:19.061
<v Speaker 5>with some people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nursing,</v>

799
00:36:19.061 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 5>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's construction and architecture </v>

800
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 5>parent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For some people.</v>

801
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 5>For some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for us it was stand up.</v>

802
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 5>It's really simple and it's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

803
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.490
<v Speaker 5>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

804
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the happiness that's involved in </v>

805
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.250
<v Speaker 5>pursuing your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your inherent desires is uninvolved.</v>

806
00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:34.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

807
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

808
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.910
<v Speaker 5>it's unappreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's under appreciated.</v>

809
00:36:37.911 --> 00:36:38.480
<v Speaker 5>People think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

810
00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:40.250
<v Speaker 5>all you have to do is find a career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

811
00:36:40.251 --> 00:36:45.251
<v Speaker 5>All you have to do is find a crib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I guarantee you there's one out </v>

812
00:36:45.251 --> 00:36:45.251
<v Speaker 5>there that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really want to do.</v>

813
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>

814
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.630
<v Speaker 5>I want to be famous.</v>

815
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 4>So that was going to say the key is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

816
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:55.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in Hollywood and I see a lot of </v>

817
00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:57.350
<v Speaker 4>misdirected what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see people that think that being </v>

818
00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 4>famous is going to bring them happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you certainly have more experience</v>

819
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:00.860
<v Speaker 4>with fam than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

820
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 4>you probably would say that it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>marginally helps you be happier with </v>

821
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.600
<v Speaker 4>giving you maybe some possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does not deliver you happiness.</v>

822
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's managed madness is what it is.</v>

823
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.070
<v Speaker 5>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've traded the whole universe.</v>

824
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how dare you keep that thing on?</v>

825
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.580
<v Speaker 5>Is that the turn it off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to want to take care of it.</v>

826
00:37:21.581 --> 00:37:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

827
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:23.710
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

828
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.290
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a form of madness because the whole</v>

829
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:31.120
<v Speaker 5>world has changed and now everywhere you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go people will know who you are,</v>

830
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.250
<v Speaker 5>but you won't know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

831
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:36.040
<v Speaker 5>and when you start becoming famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like one out of 100,</v>

832
00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:40.480
<v Speaker 5>then it becomes one out of 10 or one out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of three when you were Tom Cruise.</v>

833
00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:41.920
<v Speaker 5>It's everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

834
00:37:41.921 --> 00:37:44.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's enough so that it's weird.</v>

835
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 5>It's enough so that your reality shifts </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then everywhere you go and people </v>

836
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.290
<v Speaker 5>have their own all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>

837
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 5>they have predetermined perceptions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you based on your work.</v>

838
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether they can or it's something they </v>

839
00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Speaker 5>read that you said or somebody who met </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and you know,</v>

840
00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was.</v>

841
00:37:59.260 --> 00:37:59.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

842
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.140
<v Speaker 4>he strikes me as kind of creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they,</v>

843
00:38:02.141 --> 00:38:05.290
<v Speaker 4>if they recognize you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see their best side,</v>

844
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.970
<v Speaker 4>most likely you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the freaks,</v>

845
00:38:06.971 --> 00:38:08.740
<v Speaker 4>but most likely they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

846
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm meeting Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell my friends about this.</v>

847
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to have as deep of a connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>as quickly as possible as I can.</v>

848
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:20.110
<v Speaker 4>So you're getting all this energy </v>
<v Speaker 4>focused on you constantly.</v>

849
00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I just thought when we played pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean five or six different people came</v>

850
00:38:22.811 --> 00:38:24.920
<v Speaker 4>up to you and want to pictures and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is,</v>

851
00:38:24.921 --> 00:38:28.900
<v Speaker 4>is you're not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you get over the novelty of,</v>

852
00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:30.220
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people recognize me.</v>

853
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:35.430
<v Speaker 4>You're really giving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just giving people something </v>

854
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.570
<v Speaker 4>unless you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you get a nice,</v>

855
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

856
00:38:35.971 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

857
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:37.660
<v Speaker 4>you're being nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

858
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:42.661
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for them it's like a positive </v>

859
00:38:42.661 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it when I meet somebody,</v>

860
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to know if they're reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>

861
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Because if they don't know me then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to see who they really are.</v>

862
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 4>But if they recognize me then it's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

863
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to see this person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

864
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 4>They may talk shit behind my back or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

865
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 4>but when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I see them,</v>

866
00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:01.411
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have a little bit of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda to be nicer or try to form more </v>

867
00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 4>of a relationship than they would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise.</v>

868
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That really throws you off.</v>

869
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.700
<v Speaker 5>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not an analytical person.</v>

870
00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:12.701
<v Speaker 5>That looks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the most difficult person to </v>

871
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:14.641
<v Speaker 5>figure out always is our ourselves and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think most people at least don't have </v>

872
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.670
<v Speaker 5>nearly enough inner dialogue where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit themselves down and go over all the </v>

873
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.481
<v Speaker 5>different shit that they're thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing and behave and most people don't </v>

874
00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 5>understand their own mind and if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>block shit in your life,</v>

875
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.700
<v Speaker 5>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it so many times with guys </v>

876
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 5>that are in the closet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys that are in the closet that are gay</v>

877
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.460
<v Speaker 5>and they become like huge boozers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just eating,</v>

878
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.660
<v Speaker 5>just blocking out this part of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain as they're living their life in </v>

879
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.320
<v Speaker 5>this tortured state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

880
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that.</v>

881
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.810
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big issue for people.</v>

882
00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Meeney,</v>

883
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.800
<v Speaker 4>who's a dear friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a mentor for me coming up </v>

884
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.060
<v Speaker 4>and stand up and he came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>closet,</v>

885
00:39:53.061 --> 00:39:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I want to say he was close to 50 with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid and the guy had a drinking problem.</v>

886
00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.560
<v Speaker 4>He was overweight and then he came out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the closet.</v>

887
00:40:00.561 --> 00:40:02.780
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking trim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's happy.</v>

888
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.700
<v Speaker 4>He's got new material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

889
00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:07.580
<v Speaker 4>I just saw this load come off as skews </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon the load,</v>

890
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:09.230
<v Speaker 4>come off his shoulders and onto his </v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

891
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

892
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know yourself better when you don't </v>

893
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 5>have secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How bullshit in your head when you don't</v>

894
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.380
<v Speaker 5>have problems.</v>

895
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.610
<v Speaker 4>What was your biggest secret that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out in adulthood for you?</v>

896
00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.480
<v Speaker 4>Because you changed your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody that.</v>

897
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:28.481
<v Speaker 4>Let me just preface it by saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're somebody who I think really </v>

898
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:30.830
<v Speaker 4>significantly changed in the time I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>known you and not in a bad way.</v>

899
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.400
<v Speaker 4>You went from being guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never touched marijuana,</v>

900
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.120
<v Speaker 4>drinking nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were uh,</v>

901
00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:41.030
<v Speaker 4>you were hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were confrontational.</v>

902
00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.530
<v Speaker 4>And it in an honest way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what made you a good comedian early</v>

903
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:46.760
<v Speaker 4>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you took shit straight on and you didn't</v>

904
00:40:46.761 --> 00:40:51.761
<v Speaker 4>back off and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you were always curious and I saw </v>

905
00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:55.631
<v Speaker 4>the curious side of you kind of expand </v>
<v Speaker 4>as you got older and then I saw you </v>

906
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:56.240
<v Speaker 4>expand your mind with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

907
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.210
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different methods and,</v>

908
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.320
<v Speaker 4>and yet it's like you're still you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people don't really change usually </v>

909
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:09.971
<v Speaker 4>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like something happened to </v>

910
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you had an epiphany or something.</v>

911
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.470
<v Speaker 5>What will one thing is I got an </v>
<v Speaker 5>isolation tank and the isolation tank,</v>

912
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 5>there's never been a bigger tool for me </v>
<v Speaker 5>for in terms of like personal </v>

913
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:25.481
<v Speaker 5>development than the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the tank is you completely alone</v>

914
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:30.290
<v Speaker 5>only with your thoughts and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to distract yourself with activities</v>

915
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:35.291
<v Speaker 5>with chronic masturbation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with fucking watching tv when he </v>

916
00:41:35.291 --> 00:41:38.621
<v Speaker 5>flipping through channels late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We really shouldn't be sleeping is no </v>

917
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:38.621
<v Speaker 5>way to distract yourself from your inner</v>
<v Speaker 5>most thoughts.</v>

918
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 5>When you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing there but you.</v>

919
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 5>You don't even get your body in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>because your body's in the warm water.</v>

920
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't feel the water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After awhile,</v>

921
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.070
<v Speaker 5>there's so much salt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're floating.</v>

922
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:51.370
<v Speaker 5>So in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're forced to take a lot of your,</v>

923
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 5>your ideas head on and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this a correct thought?</v>

924
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Did I do the right thing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe I did,</v>

925
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 5>maybe I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's examine this.</v>

926
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:05.201
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as you look at things </v>

927
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:06.971
<v Speaker 5>objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're sort of forced to grow </v>

928
00:42:06.971 --> 00:42:07.370
<v Speaker 5>in that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The environment of the tank,</v>

929
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.580
<v Speaker 5>which is just another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's another form of a psychedelic </v>

930
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.911
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a psychedelic experience that is </v>

931
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:15.911
<v Speaker 5>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can.</v>

932
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 5>It can be done while you're stone cold </v>
<v Speaker 5>sober.</v>

933
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 5>He just climb on in and within.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

934
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 5>if you've done it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>within an hour,</v>

935
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:25.631
<v Speaker 5>you're in a psychedelic state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in some crazy hallucinogenic </v>

936
00:42:25.631 --> 00:42:25.631
<v Speaker 5>dream state.</v>

937
00:42:25.631 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 7>So what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Truth over and over again.</v>

938
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.940
<v Speaker 5>A lot of my anger had to do with the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was raised A.</v>

939
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.940
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't seen my father since I was like</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven years old and I always thought </v>

940
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.301
<v Speaker 5>that that didn't fuck with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then as I got older I really truly </v>

941
00:42:39.301 --> 00:42:43.201
<v Speaker 5>realized it fucked with me and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't really kind of understand it </v>

942
00:42:43.201 --> 00:42:47.401
<v Speaker 5>until I had a few psychobilly </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences and kind of like looked at </v>

943
00:42:47.401 --> 00:42:50.320
<v Speaker 5>the source of a lot of angst and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of anger that I would have.</v>

944
00:42:50.321 --> 00:42:51.300
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

945
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.830
<v Speaker 5>I would be a guy who would try to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice to everybody,</v>

946
00:42:53.831 --> 00:42:57.640
<v Speaker 5>but I was already on a trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if something happened,</v>

947
00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone did something route,</v>

948
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:02.710
<v Speaker 5>I would over escalate almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

949
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.500
<v Speaker 5>I would be ready to take them to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>full on war</v>

950
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.750
<v Speaker 7>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can I tell a story?</v>

951
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.950
<v Speaker 7>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

952
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.720
<v Speaker 7>I don't know that we've ever talked </v>
<v Speaker 7>about this,</v>

953
00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 7>but we had one kind of blow out in our </v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

954
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 7>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you were,</v>

<v Speaker 7>time.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Great check.</v>

962
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.500

<v Speaker 5>because we,</v>

963

<v Speaker 2>She told me and then she told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1007
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he did that.</v>

1008
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was hot,</v>

1009
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're living with her.</v>

1010
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get all that.</v>

1011
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I get all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I couldn't believe that you have </v>

1012
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:28.100
<v Speaker 2>said something to her like bad about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1013
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 2>because in my eyes I'm a very loyal </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and when someone's,</v>

1014
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:36.711
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're my friend and I would never go </v>

1015
00:45:36.711 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 2>to a friend's girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a very complicated situation.</v>

1016
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not healthy for a heterosexual guy </v>

1017
00:45:41.871 --> 00:45:44.180
<v Speaker 2>to be living with a hot girl in the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>with two dead.</v>

1018
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1019
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:51.130
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go on this Gig and the Gig was </v>

1020
00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.811
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking awful gig and it was a </v>

1021
00:45:53.811 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 2>long drive and I did not have a good set</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was coming back and I was with her</v>

1022
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:58.960
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had just told me this thing that you</v>

1023
00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:01.830
<v Speaker 2>had did and I was so fucking mad I </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't believe it.</v>

1024
00:46:01.831 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I was so fucking mad and we went and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice cream and um,</v>

1025
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I went to the bathroom and I came back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I opened my ice cream and Jennifer </v>

1026
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 2>was eating hers and my ice cream bar had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bite taken out of it</v>

1027
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 4>and then Jerry's peace pop</v>

1028
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and it was greg had taken a bite out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and so that I flipped the switch and </v>

1029
00:46:23.301 --> 00:46:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I threw the ice cream that your face at </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 100</v>

1030
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 4>miles an hour.</v>

1031
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.910
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I said.</v>

1032
00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:32.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember I went into.</v>

1033
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I want it to danger zone.</v>

1034
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I wanted to bring it up because we </v>

1035
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:40.090
<v Speaker 4>never talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We never did.</v>

1036
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:40.510
<v Speaker 4>And I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because obviously luck.</v>

1037
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 4>There's always two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

1038
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Three sides in this case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.060
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think number one,</v>

1040
00:46:47.061 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Speaker 4>I was a brash fucking wise ass pervert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1041
00:46:51.021 --> 00:46:56.021
<v Speaker 4>with a lot of energy back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so first point I would say is that </v>

1042
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:59.920
<v Speaker 4>with Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I said I can't believe it and live </v>

1043
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.201
<v Speaker 4>with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was probably more of a comic </v>

1044
00:47:02.201 --> 00:47:02.201
<v Speaker 4>premise than like a real attraction on </v>
<v Speaker 4>any level.</v>

1045
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1046
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:08.111
<v Speaker 4>she was hot but I wouldn't be moving in </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a chick to try to get laid with </v>

1047
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:09.860
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably more like that.</v>

1048
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that it was a residual </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling with you that like I had said </v>

1049
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.080
<v Speaker 4>that and it was maybe on your mind that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm living with her and you know,</v>

1050
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.190
<v Speaker 4>that's a little bit.</v>

1051
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty open minded dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was living with another guy,</v>

1052
00:47:22.091 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 2>the gay guy and I would go out with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time while he was gay.</v>

1053
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Don't give it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Damn it.</v>

1054
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.750
<v Speaker 2>So cut the whole thing.</v>

1055
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing is if</v>

1056
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I,</v>

1057
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it's possible I might have said that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about.</v>

1058
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say my side of it.</v>

1059
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1060
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I might have said something about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1061
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking loud mouth.</v>

1062
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:45.901
<v Speaker 2>I sat and talked a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that in my heart you and I are </v>

1063
00:47:45.901 --> 00:47:49.471
<v Speaker 2>good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had come up and done a lot of shit </v>

1064
00:47:49.471 --> 00:47:49.471
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone through a lot,</v>

1065
00:47:49.471 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 2>support each other a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if I'd said something,</v>

1066
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no fucking idea.</v>

1067
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1068
00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.650
<v Speaker 2>it's so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The memories aren't real anyway.</v>

1069
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

1070
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:04.580
<v Speaker 4>brought it up in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this arena because I feel like I </v>

1071
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.541
<v Speaker 4>don't know if there's humor in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there's a real moment </v>

1072
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:07.541
<v Speaker 4>in it where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1073
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:10.961
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it fucked me up too because </v>

1074
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:13.370
<v Speaker 4>first of all seeing you get that angry </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1075
00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scary shit.</v>

1076
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.510
<v Speaker 4>And it was the irony of you hitting me </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the Ben and Jerry's piece.</v>

1077
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.670
<v Speaker 4>Pop was also not completely lost on me</v>

1078
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.930
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I felt</v>

1079
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1080
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 4>and sadly that was right at a time when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were moving to New York,</v>

1081
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.870
<v Speaker 4>you started going down and working in </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger fields and all that shit.</v>

1082
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 4>So it became kind of convenient debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just didn't see each other as much.</v>

1083
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:41.311
<v Speaker 4>We will fucking write together every day</v>
<v Speaker 4>we drive to gigs and then all of a </v>

1084
00:48:41.311 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 4>sudden this kind of blow out happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1085
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:47.551
<v Speaker 4>and you just happened to be moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we spent a few years of just not </v>

1086
00:48:47.551 --> 00:48:51.331
<v Speaker 4>being in each other's spheres at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was water under the bridge </v>

1087
00:48:51.331 --> 00:48:51.331
<v Speaker 4>and we started to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1088
00:48:51.331 --> 00:48:56.250
<v Speaker 4>hang out and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I always wanting to talk to you </v>

1089
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.071
<v Speaker 4>about it because I felt like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>your takeaway was from that experience </v>

1090
00:48:59.071 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1091
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I did say something,</v>

1092
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't from my heart and that I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a loaded situation.</v>

1093
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 2>It was a load of situation and there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few other things that,</v>

1094
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:13.830
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few other things that we're leaning </v>

1095
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:13.830
<v Speaker 2>into that confrontation that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't anything bad that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sort of an attitude that you had </v>

1097
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.650
<v Speaker 2>taken with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1098
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

1099
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 2>there was a resentment thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty,</v>

1100
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sensitive to it.</v>

1101
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it had to do with living with a</v>

1102
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:25.080
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1103
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you and I grew in different directions.</v>

1104
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1105
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 4>you were going hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were hanging out with another </v>

1106
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.191
<v Speaker 4>Michael and you were real Kennison guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was starting to move a little bit </v>

1107
00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:37.760
<v Speaker 4>more towards</v>

1108
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.610
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clever.</v>

1109
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going through a</v>

1110
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 4>cleaning clever stage and you gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really hard time about it.</v>

1111
00:49:45.341 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 4>You could call me a pussy and you got to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking be real up there.</v>

1112
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.600
<v Speaker 2>It was intimidating because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1113
00:49:50.601 --> 00:49:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried telling me how to do my </v>
<v Speaker 2>act,</v>

1114
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>but you will get really down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would get pissed at me because I </v>

1115
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>loved you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want,</v>

1116
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to see you back off you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>you when you were at your best,</v>

1117
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Greg fitzsimmons would have the sets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

1118
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:08.611
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have a bunch of really well </v>

1119
00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:10.451
<v Speaker 2>crafted jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a bunch of good things and you </v>

1120
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:13.241
<v Speaker 2>have one thing where you just went over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking edge completely and the </v>

1121
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:15.050
<v Speaker 2>comics would be howling and I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew I was like,</v>

1122
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.990
<v Speaker 2>if he can harness that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he can figure out how to do,</v>

1123
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a sick fucking sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>

1124
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.900
<v Speaker 2>So when I would see a pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to do a letterman or pulled back to</v>

1125
00:50:23.901 --> 00:50:25.070
<v Speaker 2>do any of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1126
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>the only reason that exists is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone trying to</v>

1127
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 5>sell Toyota trucks or tie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why censored TV exists.</v>

1128
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.360
<v Speaker 5>So this idea that it became clean and </v>
<v Speaker 5>clever.</v>

1129
00:50:34.361 --> 00:50:39.361
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is clever about cutting out the </v>

1130
00:50:39.361 --> 00:50:41.621
<v Speaker 5>most fun aspects of life and </v>
<v Speaker 5>homogenizing it for so that four year </v>

1131
00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:43.520
<v Speaker 5>olds can watch it really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that.</v>

1132
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:45.350
<v Speaker 5>What's clever?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's clever.</v>

1133
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:46.910
<v Speaker 5>That's not real comedy.</v>

1134
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:50.260
<v Speaker 4>And in my head back then I was watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and saying,</v>

1135
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.320
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just going up there and you're </v>

1136
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.601
<v Speaker 4>just fucking throwing shit and common </v>
<v Speaker 4>their faces and your healing and your </v>

1137
00:50:57.601 --> 00:51:02.221
<v Speaker 4>fucking prancing the stage and a stock </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're fucking guys your hand over </v>

1138
00:51:02.221 --> 00:51:02.500
<v Speaker 4>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just like,</v>

1139
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:03.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's killing it.</v>

1140
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:08.581
<v Speaker 4>But like that's like I was coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>college as an English major and I want </v>

1141
00:51:08.581 --> 00:51:08.581
<v Speaker 4>it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1142
00:51:08.581 --> 00:51:11.950
<v Speaker 4>You don't have gone into writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me it was just a different choice.</v>

1143
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.320
<v Speaker 4>And it was one that you didn't respect.</v>

1144
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not that.</v>

1145
00:51:15.521 --> 00:51:16.560
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just said it.</v>

1146
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 5>You didn't really know I want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

1147
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.400
<v Speaker 5>It's not that I didn't respect the </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>

1148
00:51:20.401 --> 00:51:22.410
<v Speaker 5>It's not that I didn't respect the </v>
<v Speaker 5>discipline of it.</v>

1149
00:51:22.411 --> 00:51:24.870
<v Speaker 5>I know it's more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more difficult path.</v>

1150
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 5>It was that with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always knew you had a sick fucking </v>

1151
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 5>sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

1152
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.920
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like going back to Tom,</v>

1153
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.270
<v Speaker 5>don't pull,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't pull away from that.</v>

1154
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like what makes you unique?</v>

1155
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.140
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes us Howell in the back </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the room.</v>

1156
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:40.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean we're not laughing because we </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you and it's not funny.</v>

1157
00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:45.351
<v Speaker 5>It's like you would say some really dark</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up shit and they need bill eric </v>

1158
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:48.360
<v Speaker 5>and never use that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they won't use me now.</v>

1159
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.710
<v Speaker 5>But Boston comedy will book me on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>road because of the,</v>

1160
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:51.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will.</v>

1161
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:57.180
<v Speaker 4>I think that there was a part of me that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in baseball terms you were </v>

1162
00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.501
<v Speaker 4>always the guy that was the grand slam </v>
<v Speaker 4>swinger and I was the guy that just </v>

1163
00:52:01.501 --> 00:52:05.221
<v Speaker 4>wanted to get a lot of doubles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>singles and so in a sense I think </v>

1164
00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:05.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my father used to say,</v>

1165
00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:08.740
<v Speaker 4>everybody ends up where they're really </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable,</v>

1166
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in a sense for you,</v>

1167
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.300
<v Speaker 4>like you talked about going on stage </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you didn't have the material,</v>

1168
00:52:13.301 --> 00:52:16.180
<v Speaker 4>but doing an hour like balls out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking do.</v>

1169
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:21.330
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would've been my worst fucking </v>

1170
00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.281
<v Speaker 4>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me it was like I wanted to make a </v>

1171
00:52:23.281 --> 00:52:23.281
<v Speaker 4>living doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to write.</v>

1172
00:52:23.281 --> 00:52:25.700
<v Speaker 4>I want it to go on Letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like things I wanted that,</v>

1173
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.480
<v Speaker 4>that we're in this strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I like thought about it,</v>

1174
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:31.510
<v Speaker 4>but it was just natural where I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and for you it was like,</v>

1175
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.150
<v Speaker 4>you want it to fucking explode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1176
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:38.650
<v Speaker 4>you want it to be innocent and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>just a different fucking strategy,</v>

1177
00:52:38.651 --> 00:52:42.520
<v Speaker 4>different game plan than I had and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that was a big part of it too.</v>

1178
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.920
<v Speaker 4>That was a lot of the tension underneath</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight that happened.</v>

1179
00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:45.790
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1180
00:52:45.791 --> 00:52:47.830
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really well I did.</v>

1181
00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:52.831
<v Speaker 4>I resented that I was feeling like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were not approving of what I was doing </v>

1182
00:52:52.901 --> 00:52:54.430
<v Speaker 4>and you're putting pressure on me not to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

1183
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.500
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious because I always felt </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that it was always the opposite </v>

1184
00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.500
<v Speaker 5>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the people that we're dirty,</v>

1185
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Speaker 5>we're especially back then in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were the ones who were pressured,</v>

1186
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.000
<v Speaker 5>pressured to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oliver,</v>

1187
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:05.810
<v Speaker 5>Keith Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all he ever used to tell me.</v>

1188
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:07.250
<v Speaker 5>You got to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to clean it up.</v>

1189
00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 5>You said 10 bucks and 10 in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clean it up.</v>

1190
00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was always like,</v>

1191
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:16.330
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'm taking some sort of a shortcut </v>

1192
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:16.330
<v Speaker 5>by doing things and I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in talking about,</v>

1193
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:20.891
<v Speaker 5>so you saying that I think that I look </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on you for for cleaning your act up</v>

1194
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:23.630
<v Speaker 5>or trying to go the professional route </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it wasn't that,</v>

1195
00:53:23.631 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 5>it was never that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was that I didn't want you to</v>

1196
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 2>stop doing the other staff because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkest shit was the shit that would </v>

1197
00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.580
<v Speaker 2>make me laugh the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you look,</v>

1198
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anymore I'm like,</v>

1199
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fucking bits.</v>

1200
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1201
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.100
<v Speaker 4>I know in some of the bits I look back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

1202
00:53:37.101 --> 00:53:39.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those people I cannot watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself.</v>

1203
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I've early tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at these clever fucking cute </v>

1204
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:44.590
<v Speaker 4>jokes I was doing.</v>

1205
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered something he did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fucking brilliant.</v>

1206
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.380
<v Speaker 2>This was back in the day where there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1207
00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's somebody had heard the jerky </v>
<v Speaker 2>boys,</v>

1208
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:57.010
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like one one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the cds were out and like they </v>

1209
00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:01.391
<v Speaker 2>were really kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded phone calls where they would </v>

1210
00:54:01.391 --> 00:54:04.151
<v Speaker 2>fuck with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg did one where he called in a car </v>

1211
00:54:04.151 --> 00:54:07.490
<v Speaker 2>rental place and you didn't win this </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme,</v>

1212
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.280
<v Speaker 2>extreme Boston accent for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years after that go.</v>

1213
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It sounded fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole on fire you had that.</v>

1214
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 2>You were doing a lot of dark.</v>

1215
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is when you talk about the </v>

1216
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Boston comedy community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really did have our own little pot.</v>

1217
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.110
<v Speaker 4>It was like me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You caught her a Mike Mcdonald,</v>

1218
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.260
<v Speaker 4>McCarthy McCarthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really only a half a dozen of us </v>

1219
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.570
<v Speaker 4>that and I felt like an outcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

1220
00:54:38.571 --> 00:54:43.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was Dave Cross and and Marin and </v>

1221
00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:44.450
<v Speaker 4>all those guys that were doing like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sketch esoteric stuff in Cambridge.</v>

1222
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.210
<v Speaker 4>Then you had like we talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big headliners that were,</v>

1223
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had their own.</v>

1224
00:54:48.171 --> 00:54:49.280
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were drinking</v>

1225
00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:54.310
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were and looked at it in a </v>

1226
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:54.310
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1227
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 2>those guys who were looked at as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever with good material.</v>

1228
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:56.820
<v Speaker 2>And then there was guys who were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Knox who will,</v>

1229
00:54:56.821 --> 00:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would look down on them.</v>

1230
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.000
<v Speaker 2>They looked down on that material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's silly party guy,</v>

1231
00:55:03.001 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 2>sort of estate</v>

1232
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:08.950
<v Speaker 4>collar much more and yet we didn't fit </v>
<v Speaker 4>nicely into any of the categories and so</v>

1233
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:12.710
<v Speaker 4>I think we were left in like it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit of the misfit Toys Syndrome,</v>

1234
00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1235
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:14.740
<v Speaker 4>I kind of felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1236
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't about being clean or dirty,</v>

1237
00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:21.941
<v Speaker 4>it was just more about like resenting </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were fake and like seeing </v>

1238
00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:26.081
<v Speaker 4>people that were again looking like they</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted careers and non backstabbers and </v>

1239
00:55:26.181 --> 00:55:31.181
<v Speaker 4>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I felt like there was like a safety </v>

1240
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:33.161
<v Speaker 4>among the five or six guys we hung out </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that we were like real people and </v>

1241
00:55:33.161 --> 00:55:37.391
<v Speaker 4>that we were doing ballsy comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we were the hungriest ones out </v>

1242
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:37.391
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you went to an open mic night for</v>

1243
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.920
<v Speaker 4>those couple years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ours with the first fucking names on the</v>

1244
00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:43.190
<v Speaker 4>list and we were standing there like </v>
<v Speaker 4>panthers waiting to see if we were going</v>

1245
00:55:43.191 --> 00:55:43.490
<v Speaker 4>to get on.</v>

1246
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not boasting.</v>

1247
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:48.220
<v Speaker 2>We really did drive to Rhode Island all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time to do free sets all the time.</v>

1248
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Constantly trying to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would hold it over our head guy.</v>

1249
00:55:50.871 --> 00:55:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe you might not even built yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Charlie,</v>

1340
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:17.591
<v Speaker 2>back of the room howling laughing.</v>

1343
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.370
<v Speaker 2>left and we were howling and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember we sat,</v>

1344
01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I think another time we went to see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was at the faneuil hall comedy </v>

1345
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 2>connection and we actually got to sit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the green room for,</v>

1346
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1347
01:00:34.101 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but small talk.</v>

1348
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that fucking sat in a room </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that guy,</v>

1349
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.440
<v Speaker 2>got to see him perform a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is like a,</v>

1350
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy history.</v>

1351
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1352
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:50.141
<v Speaker 2>a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets a little shit from a lot of </v>

1353
01:00:50.141 --> 01:00:50.770
<v Speaker 2>people because a lot of his ideas are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>commonplace today that people go,</v>

1354
01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:52.540
<v Speaker 2>oh well he wasn't even doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1355
01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:57.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are some of the stuff isn't </v>

1356
01:00:57.541 --> 01:00:59.051
<v Speaker 2>even funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't understand is that </v>

1357
01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:02.120
<v Speaker 2>like every fucking comedian your stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets dated in time,</v>

1358
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1359
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it loses,</v>

1360
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 2>it gets replicated again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again.</v>

1361
01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Well Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>

1362
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Hicks's premises were like really </v>

1363
01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.140
<v Speaker 2>similar to Lenny Bruce's premises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the Lenny Bruce premises was that</v>

1364
01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:15.890
<v Speaker 2>people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't understand the cross,</v>

1365
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:20.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now when people going to be </v>

1366
01:01:20.891 --> 01:01:20.891
<v Speaker 2>running around with electric chairs </v>
<v Speaker 2>around their necks.</v>

1367
01:01:20.891 --> 01:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>And then Hicks had one about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like going up to Jackie Onassis </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle pendant.</v>

1369
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking of John Jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's similarities.</v>

1371
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:32.030
<v Speaker 2>But what would hicks did was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed the way people do comedy.</v>

1372
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden people to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy that would make you like make a </v>

1373
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.481
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like it would be parts of it that </v>

1374
01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:43.181
<v Speaker 2>would be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there'll be parts of it that would </v>

1375
01:01:43.181 --> 01:01:45.281
<v Speaker 2>set up the funny by pointing out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking preposterous so much of this </v>

1376
01:01:45.281 --> 01:01:45.281
<v Speaker 2>shit is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1377
01:01:45.281 --> 01:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's like it was a different ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that Don Gavin punchline every</v>

1378
01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

1379
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

1380
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:51.680
<v Speaker 2>It was a different ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1381
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I think the turning point was really a </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared.</v>

1382
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 2>This distinction with him was that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't care.</v>

1383
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what it came down to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was comedy.</v>

1384
01:01:58.701 --> 01:02:03.701
<v Speaker 2>That to its core did it was expressing </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself without any regard to their </v>

1385
01:02:03.701 --> 01:02:08.381
<v Speaker 2>section it was going to get from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience and he figured out quite early </v>

1386
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:08.840
<v Speaker 2>that that was the way to find your real </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

1387
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Only performed their stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually everybody else leaves Jesus,</v>

1388
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then your people come long.</v>

1389
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Carlin did that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way.</v>

1390
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Shura be guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would become famous</v>

1391
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 6>already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Karlyn had become famous as sort of a </v>

1392
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 6>clean and squeaky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then he became,</v>

1393
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:30.681
<v Speaker 6>I think a guy who was by the end to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fault more about his core beliefs and </v>

1394
01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 6>ended in his message.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he went so far with it,</v>

1395
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.660
<v Speaker 6>but in the sweet spot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he was on the same level as </v>

1396
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 6>Hicks in terms of like taking on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1397
01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forget Bill Hicks was doing it in Texas,</v>

1398
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:46.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was taken on Christianity in the </v>

1399
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.590
<v Speaker 6>Bible belt in the eighties and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it in a way that like,</v>

1400
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that setup punchline and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>started like that.</v>

1401
01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I watched this documentary,</v>

1402
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 6>he had like really cornet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was the guy,</v>

1403
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 6>if you want to get to the place where </v>
<v Speaker 6>Bill Hicks is,</v>

1404
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 6>you got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Carlin,</v>

1405
01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.730
<v Speaker 6>you have to learn the rules to break </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1406
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 6>And they did.</v>

1407
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 6>They were very high functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>clean,</v>

1408
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>monologue comics.</v>

1409
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.520
<v Speaker 6>And then they took that and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they made it dangerous by taking on real</v>

1410
01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.970
<v Speaker 6>ideas and at the time that's what </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody is doing.</v>

1411
01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 6>And what he had done was running to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Kennison.</v>

1412
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 6>And then Kennison completely changed his</v>
<v Speaker 6>act.</v>

1413
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:19.380
<v Speaker 6>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I first saw Hicks Hicks was doing a</v>

1414
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:21.620
<v Speaker 6>lot of Kennison in his act,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much like you,</v>

1415
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:26.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you realize when there was a few guys </v>

1416
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:26.650
<v Speaker 6>that would do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1417
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of guards that will do Boston </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys that would sound just like Knox.</v>

1418
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they would do it just because there </v>

1419
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.670
<v Speaker 6>was confidence in sounding like a really</v>
<v Speaker 6>funny guy,</v>

1420
01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 6>like a guy that you respect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a confidence in it.</v>

1421
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 6>And when I first saw Hicks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was years before that set,</v>

1422
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.590
<v Speaker 6>maybe a year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>year and a half before that said,</v>

1423
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:47.930
<v Speaker 6>the first time I saw him he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a sort of a bit of a kinison and </v>

1424
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he wouldn't even make like we do like </v>

1425
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:53.000
<v Speaker 6>the walking dead.</v>

1426
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.500
<v Speaker 6>He would roll his eyes and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make the same noises that Kennison </v>

1427
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:57.500
<v Speaker 6>would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Megan.</v>

1428
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:57.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

1429
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:57.580
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's really kind of close.</v>

1430
01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:59.320
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1431
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.310
<v Speaker 6>we've seen kinison.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bobcat probably had a touch of that.</v>

1432
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:03.130
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1433
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:08.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Marin had a touch of Hicks when he was </v>

1434
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.270
<v Speaker 6>coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had a touch of the mannerisms.</v>

1435
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.640
<v Speaker 6>He would replicate math.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I mean.</v>

1436
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 6>The matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you see that with a tail now.</v>

1437
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.330
<v Speaker 6>Lotta young towels out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1438
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 6>A lot of young guys stand hopes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

1439
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're right.</v>

1440
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 6>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

1441
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:20.360
<v Speaker 6>there was one time I was listening to </v>
<v Speaker 6>this fucking guy on,</v>

1442
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.580
<v Speaker 6>on a raw radio and I couldn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1443
01:04:23.581 --> 01:04:25.440
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is a fucking stand hope clone.</v>

1444
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>confused,</v>

1445
01:04:26.191 --> 01:04:28.610
<v Speaker 6>like maybe standing up at a cold or on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

1446
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.210
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a different guy.</v>

1447
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.600
<v Speaker 6>Does he sound like staying home?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1448
01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:32.620
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Funny.</v>

1449
01:04:32.621 --> 01:04:36.450
<v Speaker 6>Or You just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's your opposite.</v>

1450
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 6>That's your olive garden because he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>on.</v>

1451
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:42.690
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So going back to the original topic,</v>

1452
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:45.180
<v Speaker 6>our fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Glad it's over.</v>

1453
01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think that we're both uh,</v>

1454
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 6>well we kind of abandoned it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know what I mean?</v>

1455
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 6>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we didn't speak that much after that for</v>

1456
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:53.550
<v Speaker 6>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it never came up again.</v>

1457
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:54.930
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like it needed to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>discussed,</v>

1458
01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:55.890
<v Speaker 6>but I'm glad we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1459
01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:58.750
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to just clear it out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>clear it out because a,</v>

1460
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking today too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I was telling you earlier,</v>

1461
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:06.411
<v Speaker 6>I changed my whole viewpoint on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on gun control two weeks ago and did a </v>

1462
01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:07.240
<v Speaker 6>lot of research and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1463
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that there's a,</v>

1464
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.840
<v Speaker 6>there's two kinds of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people that will call people </v>

1465
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:14.840
<v Speaker 6>when I make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>apologize,</v>

1466
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 6>I tell I want to talk about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's,</v>

1467
01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 6>if it's under the and I</v>

1468
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want the right to change my mind </v>

1469
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1470
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:25.890
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the way I choose to go through </v>

1471
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:25.890
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never want to fucking.</v>

1472
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:27.730
<v Speaker 4>And it's probably my family growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish Catholic.</v>

1473
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 4>I wrote this fucking book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was all the real shit from this was</v>

1474
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1475
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:37.861
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think for one second when I </v>

1476
01:05:37.861 --> 01:05:37.861
<v Speaker 4>wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom's going to read this,</v>

1477
01:05:37.861 --> 01:05:41.611
<v Speaker 4>my aunt's going to read this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking wrote my book and it's </v>

1478
01:05:41.611 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1479
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 4>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was tough,</v>

1480
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:46.030
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost had a fucking nervous breakdown</v>

1481
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1482
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.270
<v Speaker 4>but that was like the point in my life </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I think I went,</v>

1483
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1484
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm no longer going to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pandering.</v>

1485
01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:59.011
<v Speaker 4>I'm only going to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm only going to confront things in my </v>

1486
01:05:59.011 --> 01:06:00.040
<v Speaker 4>life because I can't go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1487
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:05.041
<v Speaker 4>I want to start my life in a sense over </v>
<v Speaker 4>again and leave everything behind so I </v>

1488

<v Speaker 4>it was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were fucking,</v>

1527
01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.680
<v Speaker 4>you were working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was non stop.</v>

1528
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.770
<v Speaker 4>It was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would show up like,</v>

1529
01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:26.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at night when you were done taping all </v>

1530
01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.470
<v Speaker 4>day and then write all night and then go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back out.</v>

1531
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 5>It was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was working way too much.</v>

1532
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:32.320
<v Speaker 5>I was doing fear factor and the mantra </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the same time.</v>

1533
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:35.470
<v Speaker 5>And we had all the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>

1534
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 5>they had completely changed how they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were approaching it.</v>

1535
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Like Doug and I got completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>hoodwinked.</v>

1536
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.390
<v Speaker 5>We thought that it was going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they literally told me like,</v>

1537
01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have nudity,</v>

1538
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 5>we'll blur it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Swear,</v>

1539
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:48.430
<v Speaker 5>we'll beep it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go wild.</v>

1540
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:50.170
<v Speaker 5>If we get sued,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be a good thing.</v>

1541
01:07:50.171 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 5>We can use the publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

1542
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:53.290
<v Speaker 5>let's get fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1543
01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:54.000
<v Speaker 5>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1544
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:55.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stan hopes and I'm in,</v>

1545
01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.080
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's go.</v>

1546
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 5>We're going to fucking change the </v>
<v Speaker 5>manager.</v>

1547
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:59.530
<v Speaker 5>And then once we started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't sound like the man show.</v>

1548
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 5>That's not the man show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is not how the man show used to be.</v>

1549
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:07.441
<v Speaker 5>Like they had never had power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found out that Jimmy and Adam had </v>

1550
01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:09.550
<v Speaker 5>given up the power so that they can have</v>
<v Speaker 5>creative control.</v>

1551
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:10.270
<v Speaker 5>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1552
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:10.870
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1553
01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:15.871
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could own this fucking piece of </v>

1554
01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:15.871
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just don't just leave us alone,</v>

1555
01:08:15.871 --> 01:08:19.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just let us come up with their own </v>

1556
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:19.410
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>

1557
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Like they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had had to give it up to get </v>

1558
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.781
<v Speaker 2>creative control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it was good because once you </v>

1559
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:22.781
<v Speaker 2>get in there and you remember what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1560
01:08:22.781 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 2>it was nuts.</v>

1561
01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 4>It was the beginning of comedy central </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming a really uncreative place to </v>

1562
01:08:28.531 --> 01:08:31.200
<v Speaker 4>develop and do things and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1563
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:35.910
<v Speaker 4>it was the studio and the network it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're probably six.</v>

1564
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.470
<v Speaker 4>All women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all women.</v>

1565
01:08:37.471 --> 01:08:39.990
<v Speaker 4>Every note on the man show was coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>from women,</v>

1566
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.730
<v Speaker 4>which isn't to say they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>talented,</v>

1567
01:08:41.731 --> 01:08:43.620
<v Speaker 4>are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just always struck me of like,</v>

1568
01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.650
<v Speaker 4>do these people really have the voice of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the show?</v>

1569
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think women were watching the </v>

1570
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 4>man show.</v>

1571
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.220
<v Speaker 2>One of the big things was Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted Joey Diaz naked at the </v>

1572
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.640
<v Speaker 2>beginning of every show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a mistake.</v>

1573
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 2>He would kick open the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1574
01:08:56.961 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 2>let's get this party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would go crazy.</v>

1575
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Zoe was comedy central executive crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you tell me?</v>

1576
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Why is that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to be funny with this </v>

1577
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 2>is not what we wanted to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1578
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.050
<v Speaker 2>She was literally in tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1579
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.480
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no crying in comedy period.</v>

1580
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1581
01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.650
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At second of all,</v>

1582
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I understood her point of view.</v>

1583
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.050
<v Speaker 2>She's an intelligent woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive to her.</v>

1584
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.500
<v Speaker 2>To her it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants well scripted.</v>

1585
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 2>We know well crafted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1586
01:09:29.571 --> 01:09:32.770
<v Speaker 2>really clever pieces and bits that </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeal to understand this.</v>

1587
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:37.870
<v Speaker 2>How ever win a fucking 350 pound fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban guy with a baseball hat and </v>

1588
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:41.570
<v Speaker 2>timberlands comes running out as balls </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like grapefruit and old ladies.</v>

1589
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Pantyhose and his Dick is big and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>flapping around on his giant belly.</v>

1590
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:50.270
<v Speaker 2>You cannot not laugh when he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get this party started.</v>

1591
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:55.450
<v Speaker 2>So we made a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it your way and then we'll do </v>

1592
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:55.450
<v Speaker 2>it my way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did it her way.</v>

1593
01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Nice big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big cheer.</v>

1594
01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started the show.</v>

1595
01:09:58.131 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take two.</v>

1596
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:04.270
<v Speaker 2>We do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second time show ideas comes out </v>

1597
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.270
<v Speaker 2>naked in the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falls apart.</v>

1598
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:08.350
<v Speaker 2>People are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're giving them standing ovations </v>

1599
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.541
<v Speaker 2>and cheering and Joey's dancing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brings us out and it was perfect.</v>

1600
01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that was the beginning of many,</v>

1601
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:15.620
<v Speaker 2>many problems that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

1602
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I should have never tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't never tried to do a show at </v>

1603
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the same time as doing another show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of that I should have never tried</v>

1604
01:10:22.281 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>to do someone else's show.</v>

1605
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

1606
01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:25.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1607
01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:26.410
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fucking tough.</v>

1608
01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:31.411
<v Speaker 4>When you look at the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>office turned out a different office </v>

1609
01:10:31.411 --> 01:10:34.150
<v Speaker 4>that is now as good as the original is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking miracle.</v>

1610
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luke doesn't happen.</v>

1611
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Not talented people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously they.</v>

1612
01:10:38.711 --> 01:10:43.711
<v Speaker 4>They figured it out there and those same</v>
<v Speaker 4>people could have taken a different </v>

1613
01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:46.390
<v Speaker 4>premise starting from scratch and been </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they are today,</v>

1614
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:48.640
<v Speaker 4>shaking a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking a show that already existed.</v>

1615
01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:51.040
<v Speaker 4>You're not getting any boost data that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

1616
01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:56.041
<v Speaker 4>All you're doing is fighting off the old</v>
<v Speaker 4>image and trying to recreate the new </v>

1617
01:10:56.041 --> 01:10:56.041
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why not just start with the new one?</v>

1618
01:10:56.041 --> 01:10:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1619
01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>America was so distant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a distant memory in people's </v>

1620
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.340
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this English office,</v>

1621
01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:07.341
<v Speaker 2>like there's a giant chunk of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population that had no idea and the </v>

1622
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:11.600
<v Speaker 2>people that were fans of the office </v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned in out of curiosity and the other </v>

1623
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:11.600
<v Speaker 2>people tuned in after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.640
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it's really good,</v>

1625
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:18.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was not known enough so like </v>

1626
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:18.170
<v Speaker 2>slipped in.</v>

1627
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:18.640
<v Speaker 4>But you were doing it on the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel?</v>

1628
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the same name and the same set.</v>

1629
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

1630
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.810
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that was truly.</v>

1631
01:11:25.811 --> 01:11:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean Adam and Jimmy had worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>together in radio.</v>

1632
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.870
<v Speaker 4>They had a fucking chemistry and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fluidity.</v>

1633
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.020
<v Speaker 4>You and doug are both Alpha males who do</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up alone and then all of a sudden </v>

1634
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:37.750
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we sit on stools?</v>

1635
01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Should we stand up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was always just like,</v>

1636
01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe should go out and tear it up for </v>

1637
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 4>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Doug should.</v>

1638
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 4>Then they should throw the clips that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they are both in but the two to you </v>

1639
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 4>standing on stage together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was weird.</v>

1640
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't work.</v>

1641
01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should've done.</v>

1642
01:11:49.941 --> 01:11:54.080
<v Speaker 2>We should've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should've looked like after the first</v>

1643
01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:55.100
<v Speaker 2>time didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should've said,</v>

1644
01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should just read.</v>

1645
01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.240
<v Speaker 2>The only way we could ever do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly is if we just stopped calling </v>

1646
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.840
<v Speaker 2>it the man show and it becomes a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because you just can't say,</v>

1647
01:12:02.841 --> 01:12:04.100
<v Speaker 2>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they would be like,</v>

1648
01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that's not man show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not man show.</v>

1649
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially remember when Janet Jackson's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nipple thing happened,</v>

1650
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.380
<v Speaker 2>we got fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We lost like half of our monologues.</v>

1651
01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:14.510
<v Speaker 2>We lost a bunch of bits we couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1652
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because everything tightened up.</v>

1653
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:16.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stupid stunt had a big impact </v>

1656
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.250
<v Speaker 2>because the dummies that run these </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks,</v>

1657
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:26.280
<v Speaker 2>they just don't want to lose their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'd go into panic mode.</v>

1658
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.510
<v Speaker 2>We've got to react to this trend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks.</v>

1659
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.920
<v Speaker 2>You give me anything you have that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause us trouble because now the </v>

1660
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:33.920
<v Speaker 2>microscope of the media is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1661
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be like peering into</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single show looking for anything </v>

1662
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.481
<v Speaker 2>that's possibly offensive while this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole wave of indignation washes through</v>

1663
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:44.940
<v Speaker 2>the nation because someone saw a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 2>tit during the dinner hour</v>

1664
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:45.580
<v Speaker 4>did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1665
01:12:45.581 --> 01:12:50.581
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the sketches that I wrote was </v>

1666
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:52.631
<v Speaker 4>called a ill suitors and it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dating service for men that didn't want </v>

1667
01:12:52.631 --> 01:12:56.171
<v Speaker 4>longterm relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pair it up with women that had terminal </v>

1668
01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.080
<v Speaker 4>illnesses and one of the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was all like,</v>

1669
01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:02.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doug had this funny idea of like she's </v>

1670
01:13:02.081 --> 01:13:04.331
<v Speaker 4>in a wheelchair on the beach trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheel through the sand and he's running </v>

1671
01:13:04.331 --> 01:13:04.650
<v Speaker 4>in slow motion towards her and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1672
01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.220
<v Speaker 4>it ends with like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was supposed to end with him.</v>

1673
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm making out with this woman in bed </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his hand up her shirt.</v>

1674
01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.730
<v Speaker 4>And then it goes to him giving mouth to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth and pushing it.</v>

1675
01:13:13.731 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 4>And then they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed that.</v>

1676
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:20.150
<v Speaker 4>It was like we had no ending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we had all these funny ideas of </v>

1677
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:20.150
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1678
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:21.620
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could order like a three day weekend</v>

1679
01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:23.750
<v Speaker 4>special of bird flu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1680
01:13:23.751 --> 01:13:28.751
<v Speaker 4>you have different diseases that matched</v>
<v Speaker 4>up with how long you want it to stay in </v>

1681
01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:28.751
<v Speaker 4>the relationship.</v>

1682
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 2>It was weird too because Giana sorta </v>
<v Speaker 2>took over the show and he became like </v>

1683
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.650
<v Speaker 2>the voice of it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the amount mayonnaise,</v>

1684
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking executive producer who's </v>

1685
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.451
<v Speaker 2>got to listen to the networks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never tried to do somebody else's </v>

1686
01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:45.451
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1707
01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>barely focus on the TV because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a,</v>

1708
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.360
<v Speaker 2>a soup of pixels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I definitely shouldn't have done it.</v>

1712
01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I shouldn't have done it.</v>

1718
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.621
<v Speaker 4>and she was doing the adventures of old </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christine and then coming over and </v>

1719
01:15:04.621 --> 01:15:09.031
<v Speaker 4>trying to do her show on Fox at night </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we never saw her while she's so </v>

1720
01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:13.351
<v Speaker 4>fucking talented and like what an </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to have a black woman while </v>

1721
01:15:13.351 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 4>Obama is president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1722
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1723
01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:21.140
<v Speaker 4>and you had Sarah Palin running for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the sudden the floodgates were open </v>

1724
01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.830
<v Speaker 4>and show was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just a straight up monologue,</v>

1725
01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 4>remote piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>round table talk,</v>

1726
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:27.790
<v Speaker 4>shelf topical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because she's so talented,</v>

1727
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:32.791
<v Speaker 4>she's great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people don't give themselves enough </v>

1728
01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 4>enough time to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1729
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:36.310
<v Speaker 4>And if your name is on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to fucking drop.</v>

1730
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Either don't do it or drop everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say like a tell again going back to </v>

<v Speaker 4>That guy gave up so much fucking work.</v>

1733
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:49.261
<v Speaker 4>He invested so much of his own money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tons of it into this show because his </v>

1734
01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:53.281
<v Speaker 4>name was and it's picked up and is </v>

<v Speaker 4>How did that happen?</v>

1739
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 4>How did it come to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1740
01:16:03.401 --> 01:16:05.110
<v Speaker 4>you think you would want to do a show </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that again?</v>

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.450
<v Speaker 4>Like a weekly scat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1742
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:07.150
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1743
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>

1744
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.910
<v Speaker 2>This is really what it should have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing all along.</v>

1745
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.540
<v Speaker 2>This is the most fun podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just this is,</v>

1746
01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:13.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1747
01:16:13.691 --> 01:16:14.200
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

1748
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 2>what are you providing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1749
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.640
<v Speaker 2>when you have an hour television show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be providing </v>

1750
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.481
<v Speaker 2>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be providing some </v>

1751
01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:26.221
<v Speaker 2>sort of a release.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm better at entertainment </v>

1752
01:16:26.221 --> 01:16:26.221
<v Speaker 2>doing this than I am at all that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1753
01:16:26.221 --> 01:16:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think writing.</v>

1754
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I can write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to make sketches.</v>

1755
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:30.840
<v Speaker 2>I can make funny stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely can.</v>

1756
01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:32.140
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy doing it.</v>

1757
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy this more and between this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up comedy.</v>

1758
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.800
<v Speaker 2>Those are like my two favorite things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the only reason why I ever did </v>

1759
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:40.800
<v Speaker 2>acting is because they gave me money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do acting.</v>

1760
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had to do acting because I did </v>

1761
01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.491
<v Speaker 2>MTV and I got a development team and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden I'm doing a pilot for a </v>

1762
01:16:47.491 --> 01:16:51.781
<v Speaker 2>sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never really wanted to be an </v>

1763
01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:51.781
<v Speaker 2>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that appealing to me.</v>

1764
01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And then when you hang out with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>

1765
01:16:51.961 --> 01:16:53.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were fucking Weirdos,</v>

1766
01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.850
<v Speaker 2>weird fucking pretentious self absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strange fucking people,</v>

1767
01:16:57.851 --> 01:16:58.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're odd.</v>

1768
01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:01.360
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's saying a truthful thing all </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1769
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's trying to be.</v>

1770
01:17:02.941 --> 01:17:07.941
<v Speaker 2>This was the same person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person that like is everyone that </v>

1771
01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:08.760
<v Speaker 2>everyone accepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the person that you know,</v>

1772
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1773
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1774
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>thinking about going Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know everyone.</v>

1775
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.310
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's unflappable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:17:15.311 --> 01:17:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever scared.</v>

1778
01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:23.190
<v Speaker 4>It's just always got to be confident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to always show people you're </v>

1779
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:23.190
<v Speaker 4>relaxed.</v>

1780
01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1781
01:17:23.671 --> 01:17:26.160
<v Speaker 2>A disconnected and test with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking life.</v>

1782
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I've met people that are obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>

1783
01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.510
<v Speaker 2>but they're varied there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1784
01:17:30.511 --> 01:17:34.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking sameness to the actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The douche.</v>

1785
01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a sameness to them that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking because it doesn't make sense.</v>

1786
01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:43.041
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't seem to exist in other things in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that there's people that develop </v>

1787
01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:45.030
<v Speaker 2>like a hardness if like they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial business,</v>

1788
01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:47.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a cut throat aspect to like</v>

1789
01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 2>stocks and bonds and treasuries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1790
01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:52.290
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's similarities,</v>

1791
01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but they're very more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actor is like,</v>

1792
01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.970
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1793
01:17:56.971 --> 01:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it's like Strip club Dj.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey everybody dances on the table.</v>

1794
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 2>The big girls come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have the same voice strip club </v>

1795
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Djs have the same voice and actors have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same or something.</v>

1796
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not always</v>

1797
01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.120
<v Speaker 4>you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you go in and audition,</v>

1798
01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:18.121
<v Speaker 4>there are so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like watching the fucking </v>

1799
01:18:18.121 --> 01:18:18.121
<v Speaker 4>Westminster dog show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You walk in,</v>

1800
01:18:18.121 --> 01:18:20.170
<v Speaker 4>you sign in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you schmooze with the other actors,</v>

1801
01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:25.171
<v Speaker 4>you look at your lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then when you walk in you got to say </v>

1802
01:18:25.171 --> 01:18:26.890
<v Speaker 4>something clever and you a mile </v>
<v Speaker 4>flirtation with the casting director.</v>

1803
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:31.750
<v Speaker 4>Then you say something that's a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit naughty and then you start the scene</v>

1804
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:36.930
<v Speaker 4>and then you finish it and they tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking great and you tell them </v>

1805
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:37.930
<v Speaker 4>it's great seeing you walk out like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't need the job.</v>

1806
01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Then you get in your car in the parking </v>
<v Speaker 4>garage and you start slamming your head </v>

1807
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.130
<v Speaker 4>against the steering wheel and hating </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and then waiting for the call.</v>

1808
01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only got into acting for money,</v>

1809
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't.</v>

1810
01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:55.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up for and once I realized that I </v>

1811
01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.140
<v Speaker 2>can make a living without acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1812
01:18:56.141 --> 01:18:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of shied away from,</v>

1813
01:18:57.730 --> 01:19:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't even act at all for like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years until I did a Kevin James Movie.</v>

1814
01:19:01.031 --> 01:19:02.010
<v Speaker 2>The zookeeper moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't done anything like 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't stand up and acting is </v>

1816
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:07.570
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a job standing up.</v>

1817
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when the hard part coming up with </v>

1818
01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>new material and putting together a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and you know,</v>

1819
01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.500
<v Speaker 2>trying to structure it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in worrying,</v>

1820
01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to fill time,</v>

1821
01:19:15.941 --> 01:19:16.700

<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

1822
01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.520
<v Speaker 2>don't forget anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go up notes though.</v>

1823
01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1825
01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:22.840

<v Speaker 2>That's still the kind of work is nothing</v>

1826
01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.700
<v Speaker 2>compared to the work of doing somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else's</v>

1827
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.320

<v Speaker 4>what you put into it and I find </v>

1829
01:19:30.321 --> 01:19:30.321
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I go on the road and I'll be </v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1960
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had a joke about Roswell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico about the UFO crash and about</v>

1961
01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:49.870
<v Speaker 2>how the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're printed in the paper.</v>

1962
01:24:49.871 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a day's newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roswell daily record.</v>

1963
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It's at my house in a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1964
01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:56.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad.</v>

1965
01:24:56.141 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 2>We have recovered a flying disc that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

1966
01:24:58.631 --> 01:24:59.680
<v Speaker 2>The government says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1967
01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.630
<v Speaker 2>this is the first captured flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>saucer.</v>

1968
01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Then the next day they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1969
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:06.090
<v Speaker 2>it was just a balloon.</v>

1971
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.990

<v Speaker 2>Apparently they opened the balloon.</v>

1972
01:25:10.991 --> 01:25:12.970
<v Speaker 2>They were drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so shenanigans took place,</v>

1973
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:16.990
<v Speaker 2>but they thought it was a Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This chick stands up at the comedy store</v>

<v Speaker 7>And I go,</v>

2002
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 7>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about Roman slaves.</v>

2003
01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:28.210
<v Speaker 7>There were white.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He didn't corner the market on slavery.</v>

2004
01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.670
<v Speaker 7>Sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2005
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:34.930
<v Speaker 7>and fucking she wouldn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't stop in the face of a fact that</v>

2006
01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:40.361
<v Speaker 7>went against her whole fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what are you saying that slavery has </v>

2007
01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:44.321
<v Speaker 7>never existed or that because blacks </v>
<v Speaker 7>have been one of the groups that has </v>

2008
01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 7>been subjugated into slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're defending all slavery.</v>

2009
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:52.450
<v Speaker 7>Is it just not on the table?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It should not be discussed because </v>

2010
01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:55.151
<v Speaker 7>you're a college where you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 7>to discussion and break it down and I </v>

2011
01:26:55.151 --> 01:26:56.360
<v Speaker 7>just went off on that rant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2012
01:26:56.361 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 7>I've found that colleges were more pc or</v>
<v Speaker 7>more,</v>

2013
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.620
<v Speaker 7>more like restricted and censored than </v>
<v Speaker 7>anywhere.</v>

2014
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 7>People will get upset if you would bring</v>
<v Speaker 7>up anything controversial,</v>

2015
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 7>look at the board.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anything racial,</v>

2016
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.390
<v Speaker 7>anything racial,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anything sexist,</v>

2017
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:13.580
<v Speaker 7>anything homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you can't.</v>

2018
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.800
<v Speaker 7>There's a difference between racist and </v>
<v Speaker 7>racial.</v>

2019
01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.080
<v Speaker 7>Does the difference between discussing </v>
<v Speaker 7>homosexuality and homophobic and they </v>

2020
01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 7>can't make that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all buzzwords and just real,</v>

2021
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:28.470
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>real facts about humanity that people </v>

2022
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.470
<v Speaker 7>don't want you to talk about when it </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes to,</v>

<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's interesting about life is </v>

2026
01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:36.610

<v Speaker 7>different parts of the world.</v>

2027
01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:41.441
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I love that when you bring up </v>

2093
01:30:33.301 --> 01:30:35.380
<v Speaker 4>started as radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's becoming.</v>

2094
01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Then it was satellite podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think this is the one that's </v>

2095
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:40.420

2096
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a place for this.</v>

2097
01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this isn't the ultimate thing to sit</v>

2098
01:30:43.701 --> 01:30:45.800
<v Speaker 5>when you're home with your girl and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to watch something on TV.</v>

2099
01:30:45.801 --> 01:30:47.540
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to sit and watch a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking podcast,</v>

2100
01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:52.541
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's weird to sit and watch </v>

2101
01:30:52.541 --> 01:30:54.380
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you maybe want to watch a movie </v>

2102
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:54.380
<v Speaker 5>or do you want to watch a sitcom or.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for times,</v>

2103
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.230
<v Speaker 5>especially when you're doing boring </v>
<v Speaker 5>labor,</v>

2104
01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:02.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're fucking stacking boxes and </v>

2105
01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.271
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of people that are </v>

2106
01:31:04.271 --> 01:31:04.271
<v Speaker 5>listening to this right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>working jobs.</v>

2107
01:31:04.271 --> 01:31:07.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they either have an ipod on or they </v>

2108
01:31:07.131 --> 01:31:07.131
<v Speaker 5>have a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2109
01:31:07.131 --> 01:31:08.350
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a player somewhere where it's a,</v>

2110
01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:08.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an MP,</v>

2111
01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:13.991
<v Speaker 5>three player or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're there listening to this </v>

2112
01:31:13.991 --> 01:31:16.751
<v Speaker 5>while they're driving in their cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll listen to this while they're on </v>

2113
01:31:16.751 --> 01:31:19.031
<v Speaker 5>planes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a place for this form of </v>

2114
01:31:19.031 --> 01:31:19.031
<v Speaker 5>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2115
01:31:19.031 --> 01:31:20.090
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I really don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>desire to do anything else.</v>

2116
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2117
01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:23.390
<v Speaker 5>I've thought about doing other different</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorts of TV projects,</v>

2118
01:31:23.391 --> 01:31:28.370
<v Speaker 5>but really the best thing that I do is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this and stand up and then the UFC,</v>

2119
01:31:28.371 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 5>that's like enough stuff to venture off </v>
<v Speaker 5>into more acting as well.</v>

2120
01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:34.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just pretending,</v>

2121
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2122
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I,</v>

2123
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:39.570
<v Speaker 4>when I look at the fact that in standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>and podcasting,</v>

2124
01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 4>I can literally say anything except </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed the president.</v>

2125
01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 4>It's mindbody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you just,</v>

2126
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 4>he's not mit is not president yet to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

2127
01:31:49.081 --> 01:31:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I think I can say kill Mitt Romney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2128
01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.680
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot know he's running for </v>

2129
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:56.680
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying in theory.</v>

2130
01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess my,</v>

2131
01:31:57.150 --> 01:32:02.150
<v Speaker 4>my question really though is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that eventually it's going </v>

2132
01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:05.161
<v Speaker 4>to be like you're going to turn on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio in your car and it's going to be </v>

2133
01:32:05.161 --> 01:32:08.131
<v Speaker 4>podcasts streaming or a Ford edge or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ford has the sync.</v>

2134
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Which has like a three g built into it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can download like stitcher and </v>

2135
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.930
<v Speaker 4>content and you need to get off </v>
<v Speaker 4>stitcher.</v>

2136
01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I got off it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten a little off it.</v>

2137
01:32:19.391 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten everybody off it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they steal your content.</v>

2138
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:27.781
<v Speaker 4>They cut and paste it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get any record of the </v>

2139
01:32:27.781 --> 01:32:29.881
<v Speaker 4>downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got charts and records they </v>

2140
01:32:29.881 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 4>didn't use to end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're running ads.</v>

2141
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 4>They're running banner ads on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>content,</v>

2142
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:37.650
<v Speaker 4>so this advertising going on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>content that you're not participating </v>

2143
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:37.650
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2144
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:38.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those little itunes ads,</v>

2145
01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:40.570
<v Speaker 4>those are million dollar ad.</v>

2146
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is what I know.</v>

2147
01:32:43.181 --> 01:32:48.181
<v Speaker 5>This is what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stitcher is an easy resource to put </v>

2148
01:32:48.181 --> 01:32:50.671
<v Speaker 5>something out that's already free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My thing is already free and stitcher </v>

2149
01:32:50.671 --> 01:32:52.030
<v Speaker 5>allows more people to get my free shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's how I look at it.</v>

2150
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They use it.</v>

2151
01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:58.681
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me it's just another distribution </v>

2152
01:32:58.681 --> 01:32:59.830
<v Speaker 5>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My advertisement is in on it.com,</v>

2153
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 5>which I owned part of and in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fleshlight,</v>

2154
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:07.051
<v Speaker 5>which has been our sponsor since we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a laptop with fucking snowflakes in </v>

2155
01:33:07.051 --> 01:33:07.051
<v Speaker 5>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2156
01:33:07.051 --> 01:33:08.830
<v Speaker 5>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked stitcher.</v>

2157
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:10.630
<v Speaker 5>I liked the fact that it gets to other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2158
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 5>Some people don't like it because it can</v>
<v Speaker 5>mess with your itunes,</v>

2159
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.660
<v Speaker 5>your ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your itunes numbers,</v>

2160

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2173
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:50.960
<v Speaker 4>to me it doesn't even need a metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 4>for content is being taken and sold.</v>

2174
01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:52.190
<v Speaker 4>It stays here.</v>

2175
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:57.210
<v Speaker 5>They have done a service for me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've distributed to me to eat for do </v>

2176
01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:01.080
<v Speaker 5>that service,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm already doing that service and </v>

2177
01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:01.080
<v Speaker 5>they have expanded my market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've,</v>

2178
01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.010
<v Speaker 5>they've given more people something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do and have a great product that I do </v>

2179
01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 5>for free anyway and I only do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I only do it for free,</v>

2180
01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:11.800
<v Speaker 5>so if more people get my free podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

2181
01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.160
<v Speaker 5>So if somebody is making a couple bucks </v>
<v Speaker 5>selling little ads in order to </v>

2182
01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:17.560
<v Speaker 5>distribute my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it's worth to them.</v>

2183
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I guess for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my issue is I have ads that I get paid </v>

2184
01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:23.820
<v Speaker 4>per download and that they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>giving me the count on those,</v>

2185
01:34:23.821 --> 01:34:28.821
<v Speaker 4>so that was taking money out of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>pocket and then on top of it when I </v>

2186
01:34:28.821 --> 01:34:28.890
<v Speaker 4>found out that they were running ads on </v>
<v Speaker 4>my content,</v>

2187
01:34:28.891 --> 01:34:33.891
<v Speaker 4>that's double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a double whammy and to me it's </v>

2188
01:34:33.891 --> 01:34:34.740
<v Speaker 4>like the more guys that are on Stitcher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more people just go,</v>

2189
01:34:34.741 --> 01:34:39.741
<v Speaker 4>well fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to listen to podcast on </v>

2190
01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:41.661
<v Speaker 4>stitcher instead of people going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be on this thing </v>

2191
01:34:41.661 --> 01:34:41.661
<v Speaker 4>because it's a bad business.</v>

2192
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.700
<v Speaker 5>You have a different sort of a take on </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2193
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my take on it is a,</v>

2194
01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not based on.</v>

2195
01:34:49.570 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have a thing that would pay me </v>
<v Speaker 5>based on downloads,</v>

2196
01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 5>so that makes more sense that you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>pissed.</v>

2197
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2198
01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:56.100
<v Speaker 4>you have the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can give them those numbers of those</v>

2199
01:34:56.101 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 4>downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use stitcher so</v>

2200
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.230
<v Speaker 2>much because I liked the software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2201
01:35:00.231 --> 01:35:02.720
<v Speaker 2>that would actually be thing if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could work it into,</v>

2202
01:35:02.721 --> 01:35:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that'd be like the best solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it looks.</v>

2203
01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I still have additional downloads </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of itunes.</v>

2204
01:35:07.611 --> 01:35:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Can we incorporate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:13.391
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're still legitimate </v>

2206
01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:13.391
<v Speaker 2>listeners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2207
01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:13.391
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

2208
01:35:13.391 --> 01:35:15.070
<v Speaker 4>I guess they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got myth because I only found,</v>

2209
01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I found out about it and I emailed them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't respond and then when they </v>

2210
01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.911
<v Speaker 4>finally did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they denied it and then when they were </v>

2211
01:35:23.911 --> 01:35:23.911
<v Speaker 4>found to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

2212
01:35:23.911 --> 01:35:24.790
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do do that,</v>

2213
01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:27.070
<v Speaker 4>but we'll give you like a penny per </v>
<v Speaker 4>million.</v>

2214
01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:27.970
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2215
01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:33.090
<v Speaker 4>don't make me an offer now that you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>already stolen it and sold it and made </v>

2216
01:35:33.090 --> 01:35:35.380
<v Speaker 4>money and now now you want to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and give me a shitty offer.</v>

2217
01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:38.050
<v Speaker 4>So I just thought these are bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are not.</v>

2218
01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:43.170
<v Speaker 4>And I've had the same conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>a number of big podcast who's who had </v>

2219
01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.440
<v Speaker 4>the same experience they do when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>confronted them,</v>

2220
01:35:44.441 --> 01:35:46.600
<v Speaker 4>they denied it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made shitty offers,</v>

2221
01:35:46.601 --> 01:35:48.940
<v Speaker 4>they were disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's to me,</v>

2222
01:35:48.941 --> 01:35:51.970
<v Speaker 4>it's setting up a business model to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the road you do this.</v>

2223
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:53.140
<v Speaker 4>Say you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say fuck it.</v>

2224
01:35:53.141 --> 01:35:56.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing four podcasts a week and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>not gonna go on the road,</v>

2225
01:35:56.470 --> 01:36:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sell ads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now all the sudden there's gonna be </v>

2226
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:04.231
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a aggregator sites like stitcher that </v>

2227
01:36:04.231 --> 01:36:06.580
<v Speaker 4>I've already called your rss feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Copied and pasted it.</v>

2228
01:36:06.581 --> 01:36:11.581
<v Speaker 4>So it's not connected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're not getting counts public or </v>

2229
01:36:11.581 --> 01:36:11.581
<v Speaker 4>rss feeds on your website?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2230
01:36:11.581 --> 01:36:12.820
<v Speaker 4>but they have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2231
01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.520
<v Speaker 4>they have to stream through the my rss </v>
<v Speaker 4>feed.</v>

2232
01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:18.240
<v Speaker 4>They can't just scream your rss feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>though than that.</v>

2233
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:18.940
<v Speaker 4>But they don't.</v>

2234
01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:19.740
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2235
01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:24.741
<v Speaker 8>I mean the and that means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>just saying that any player can do the </v>

2236
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:24.741
<v Speaker 8>same,</v>

2237
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:24.741
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stitcher,</v>

2238
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 2>we cannot have another artist argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2239
01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>

2240
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn it's,</v>

2241
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:33.490
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an important point that you're </v>

2242
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 2>bringing up and especially what you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that you know,</v>

2243
01:36:33.701 --> 01:36:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you were getting paid by the download </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't.</v>

2244
01:36:35.861 --> 01:36:40.861
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any experience with </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating with them because to me it </v>

2245
01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:44.041
<v Speaker 2>was nothing but a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't get to experience the lying </v>

2246
01:36:44.041 --> 01:36:47.371
<v Speaker 2>or the whatever you say you experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get to experience that because </v>

2247
01:36:47.371 --> 01:36:47.860
<v Speaker 2>my take was right away was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2248
01:36:47.861 --> 01:36:49.540
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll now more people can hear it.</v>

2249
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.510
<v Speaker 2>We have hundreds of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that listen outside of Itunes,</v>

2250
01:36:53.511 --> 01:36:57.820
<v Speaker 2>so for us it's to have the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution that way.</v>

2251
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:59.650
<v Speaker 8>Better institutions is actually really </v>
<v Speaker 8>good people.</v>

2252
01:36:59.651 --> 01:37:04.270
<v Speaker 8>I had dinner with the president and he </v>
<v Speaker 8>was giving them free content.</v>

2253
01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:04.600
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2254
01:37:04.601 --> 01:37:05.710
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I probably love you.</v>

2255
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:09.550
<v Speaker 8>I'm giving free content out to every </v>
<v Speaker 8>single person in the world and they just</v>

2256
01:37:09.551 --> 01:37:11.700
<v Speaker 8>happen to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a player that,</v>

2257
01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:12.430
<v Speaker 8>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2258
01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.880
<v Speaker 8>use it does the same thing in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Am I see,</v>

2259
01:37:14.881 --> 01:37:19.881
<v Speaker 8>I don't get what you and a few of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>other podcasts you guys are saying </v>

2260
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:20.330
<v Speaker 8>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're giving something for free out.</v>

2261
01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Speaker 8>Didn't you have an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 8>somebody?</v>

2262
01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.190
<v Speaker 8>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to go down there.</v>

2263
01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:26.830
<v Speaker 2>That's just saying that I said my piece,</v>

2264
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:28.050
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're both,</v>

2265
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.800
<v Speaker 4>we're both going after different things </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the podcast and I guess there's a,</v>

2266
01:37:31.801 --> 01:37:32.760
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2267
01:37:32.761 --> 01:37:34.140
<v Speaker 4>we're finding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2268
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:39.270
<v Speaker 4>podcasting is finding its footing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how it's going to be delivered and this </v>

2269
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:42.030
<v Speaker 4>will be an ongoing discussion and see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what makes most sense and what's the</v>

2270
01:37:42.031 --> 01:37:42.750
<v Speaker 4>most ethical.</v>

2271
01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a bunch of guys are doing </v>

2272
01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.031
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Marin I know has a thing where you </v>

2273
01:37:49.031 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 2>can't get as old ones unless you pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>your premium listeners premium,</v>

2274
01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:52.390
<v Speaker 2>you know you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2275
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.140
<v Speaker 2>I just think he's done really well with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2276
01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it seems me like you charge someone </v>

2277
01:37:59.260 --> 01:37:59.260
<v Speaker 2>for something that you also have for </v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

2278
01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.540
<v Speaker 2>like why not just have it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just trying to find new ways to </v>

2279
01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:04.540
<v Speaker 2>make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it seems weird,</v>

2280
01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:08.691
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the old ones they have to pay for </v>

2281
01:38:08.691 --> 01:38:08.691
<v Speaker 2>the old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's that?</v>

2282
01:38:08.691 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 2>You want them to get all your stuff if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want any of it free.</v>

2283
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:15.831
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that it should all be </v>

2284
01:38:15.831 --> 01:38:15.831
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

2285
01:38:15.831 --> 01:38:18.280
<v Speaker 4>Well I think so to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that with a lot of times with </v>

2286
01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:18.830
<v Speaker 4>premium membership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they take out the commercials,</v>

2287
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times like I have,</v>

2288
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:26.330
<v Speaker 4>I have something to give away for free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like the best fits dog radio </v>

2289
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:29.890
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got like five or six like Zach </v>

2290
01:38:29.890 --> 01:38:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Galifianakis and Jimmy Kimmel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some bigger names and I sort of </v>

2291
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:33.460
<v Speaker 4>took the best five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

2292
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.740
<v Speaker 4>eight minutes from each as a way of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>promoting the shell.</v>

2293
01:38:35.741 --> 01:38:38.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Originally I was thinking,</v>

2296
01:38:43.211 --> 01:38:43.211
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't make sense.</v>

<v Speaker 2>As soon as I saw he's a star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2320
01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 2>He should have been like that a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>

2321
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:44.550
<v Speaker 2>He needed something like a podcast to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really let the audience see who the fuck</v>

2322
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:46.980
<v Speaker 2>he really was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The day that Whitney Houston died,</v>

2323
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I put a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said in honor of the death of the </v>

2324
01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Great Whitney Houston.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She died.</v>

2326
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 2>She died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally should have done it.</v>

2327
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I totally should have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so rude.</v>

2328
01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:05.610
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of shit about it.</v>

2329
01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:06.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2330

2331
01:40:08.641 --> 01:40:09.940

<v Speaker 2>I mean that was ridiculous.</v>

2332
01:40:09.941 --> 01:40:14.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whitney Houston had that TV show with </v>

2333
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:14.941
<v Speaker 2>Bobby Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

2334
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Crack is whack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:19.280

<v Speaker 2>They'd be screaming.</v>

2336
01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:22.510
<v Speaker 2>It was chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be screaming at each.</v>

2337
01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Remember when she would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would be.</v>

2338
01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't say,</v>

2339
01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.170
<v Speaker 2>how dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

2340
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.290
<v Speaker 2>A baby screaming if that's offensive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people.</v>

2341
01:40:36.291 --> 01:40:37.850
<v Speaker 2>You can't even say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be screaming,</v>

2342
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk like that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not Allowed to say that.</v>

2346
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I find the more I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more I'm allowed to.</v>

2347
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:53.560

<v Speaker 4>You have to like stay wet.</v>

2348
01:40:53.561 --> 01:40:58.561

<v Speaker 4>you know when you get out of the pool </v>

2349
01:40:58.561 --> 01:40:58.561
<v Speaker 4>and you dry off and then you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go back in to stay wet.</v>

2352
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:05.750
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone talked about the Jeremy Lin </v>

2353
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:08.491
<v Speaker 6>incident where a reporter got in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 6>for saying a chicken in his either </v>

2354
01:41:08.491 --> 01:41:08.980
<v Speaker 6>accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't saying it as a joke.</v>

2355
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.620
<v Speaker 6>It slipped out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is what you say.</v>

2356
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:16.621
<v Speaker 6>It's not so we're supposed to run every </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking thing we say through the prism </v>

2357
01:41:16.621 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 6>of political correctness and who I how.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How do you talk craziness will or unless</v>

2358
01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:23.080
<v Speaker 6>the guy was trying to be cute because </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you have to say if the guy was just</v>

2359
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:23.830
<v Speaker 6>trying to be cute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:26.530
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of a douchey thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the guy was just trying.</v>

2361
01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.180
<v Speaker 6>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's never really gonna admit it.</v>

2362
01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 6>He's not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2363
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:30.550
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to be cute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got caught,</v>

2364
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.630
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2365
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:32.190
<v Speaker 6>Jake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2366
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a Chinese guy,</v>

2367
01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

2368
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.700
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people were upset enough that that guy </v>

2369
01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:41.700
<v Speaker 6>like he got suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2370
01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 6>You hired,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the writer,</v>

2371
01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:43.690
<v Speaker 6>somebody wrote it</v>

2372
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:48.990
<v Speaker 4>and then he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the broadcaster might've gotten </v>

2373
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:51.541
<v Speaker 4>suspended or I got his wrist slap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think the guy who wrote it into </v>

2374
01:41:51.541 --> 01:41:51.541
<v Speaker 4>the copy</v>

2375
01:41:51.541 --> 01:41:51.541
<v Speaker 6>godfather was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2376
01:41:51.541 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 6>he was probably trying to be cute if he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrote it,</v>

2377
01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:54.550
<v Speaker 6>actually wrote it down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

2378
01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:59.551
<v Speaker 6>When you write things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think about them way more than just </v>

2379
01:41:59.551 --> 01:41:59.551
<v Speaker 6>saying it's hard to think he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>catch that.</v>

2380
01:41:59.551 --> 01:42:04.500
<v Speaker 6>I said kamikaze this weekend in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 6>during a fight and it was totally </v>

2381
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 6>accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guy was losing,</v>

2382
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 6>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It kamikaze is not like in Japan,</v>

2383
01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 6>like St Kamikaze in Japan is not like </v>
<v Speaker 6>calling someone a check.</v>

2384
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 6>It's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are like,</v>

2385
01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:16.740
<v Speaker 6>they're revered warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They risk their lives like their,</v>

2386
01:42:16.741 --> 01:42:21.741
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their brain stumped on extinguish them </v>

2387
01:42:21.741 --> 01:42:21.741
<v Speaker 6>while they're pretty sure that rather I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they were correct,</v>

2388
01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:24.610
<v Speaker 6>but there was a dude who was losing and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2389
01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.160
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's losing he,</v>

2390
01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:31.230
<v Speaker 6>the only way he's going to win this </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight is if he goes just fucking </v>

2391
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:31.230
<v Speaker 6>kamikaze.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Adam.</v>

2392
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:35.880

<v Speaker 6>I didn't even think about it until </v>

2393
01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 6>somebody wrote it online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe Rogan said kamikaze.</v>

2394
01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.240
<v Speaker 6>That's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I would always say.</v>

2395
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:40.930
<v Speaker 6>You gotta just go kill or be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go in there and dive bomb on them.</v>

2396
01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write on a lot of black shows for some</v>

<v Speaker 4>Louis brought me out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2401
01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:57.160

<v Speaker 4>past spring.</v>

2402
01:42:57.490 --> 01:43:01.480
<v Speaker 4>And so every time I come in it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm white and it's almost always</v>

<v Speaker 4>like all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Jamie Foxx thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>brought in.</v>

2405
01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:10.020
<v Speaker 4>Things weren't going well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they brought me in and you </v>

2406
01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:10.020
<v Speaker 4>think to try to</v>

2407
01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:14.840
<v Speaker 6>help out what was the Jamie Foxx thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was this guy named Don crocket had a </v>

2408
01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.310
<v Speaker 6>sketch show that Jamie Foxx was </v>
<v Speaker 6>producing and um,</v>

2409

2410
01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.470
<v Speaker 6>everything I said was taken like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>there he goes again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were calling me Mr Magoo because I </v>

2414
01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:36.800
<v Speaker 4>would just blindly walk into things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was funny,</v>

2415
01:43:36.801 --> 01:43:39.860
<v Speaker 4>like nobody was offended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like the running joke is that</v>

2416
01:43:39.861 --> 01:43:42.380
<v Speaker 4>it's so easy to just say the wrong </v>

<v Speaker 4>you're taking the idea off the table.</v>

2423
01:43:54.831 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 4>What you're really doing is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

01:43:56.181 --> 01:43:57.920
<v Speaker 4>we're not allowed to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2476

2480
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:31.751
<v Speaker 4>gone into the depths of challenged ideas</v>

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>successful as well as they get older.</v>

2534
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:47.790
<v Speaker 2>And what's really interesting is those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys that get into like secret societies</v>

2535
01:48:47.791 --> 01:48:50.250
<v Speaker 2>when they're in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skull and crossbones,</v>

01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:53.220
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking real.</v>

2537
01:48:53.221 --> 01:48:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Those Ivy League schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really high end schools,</v>

2538
01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>the Illuminati all send their kids to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really do joined secret societies </v>

2539
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:07.130
<v Speaker 2>like the skull and bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look really do like weird gay shit </v>

2540
01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:08.510
<v Speaker 2>to each other and the blokes and robes</v>

2541
01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.190
<v Speaker 4>can hit each other and they do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more out on the surface.</v>

2542
01:49:12.191 --> 01:49:14.000
<v Speaker 4>They're called dinner clubs at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

2543
01:49:14.001 --> 01:49:16.960
<v Speaker 4>you try to get into a dinner club and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2544
01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:19.990
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a more transparent version of skull</v>

2545
01:49:19.991 --> 01:49:21.310
<v Speaker 4>and bones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same thing.</v>

2546
01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:24.550
<v Speaker 4>These are my boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna Watch each other's backs,</v>

2547
01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in college beyond college.</v>

2548
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.760
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the criteria for getting in are </v>

2549
01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.631
<v Speaker 4>fucking creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They happen at this one happens to be </v>

2550
01:49:33.631 --> 01:49:33.631
<v Speaker 4>all Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one is all German Jewish.</v>

2551
01:49:33.631 --> 01:49:34.690
<v Speaker 4>This one is all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2552
01:49:34.691 --> 01:49:39.691
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people whose grandparents came over on </v>

2553
01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:42.331
<v Speaker 4>the mayflower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all like these specific fucking </v>

2554
01:49:42.331 --> 01:49:45.300
<v Speaker 4>clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same thing I was thinking </v>

2555
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:45.300
<v Speaker 4>like origin based click.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not always.</v>

2556
01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 4>I think there's different ways they </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguish themselves and I'm sure some</v>

2557
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:49.090
<v Speaker 4>of them are based on like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2558
01:49:49.091 --> 01:49:54.091
<v Speaker 4>this is somebody who works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has done a lot of community service </v>

2559
01:49:54.091 --> 01:49:54.091
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2560
01:49:54.091 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 4>So let's have a dinner club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them are based on,</v>

2561
01:49:54.810 --> 01:49:55.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your blue blood.</v>

2562
01:49:55.931 --> 01:49:56.320
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2563
01:49:56.321 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 4>what your DNA is and who your who your </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents were.</v>

2564
01:49:59.810 --> 01:50:01.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then on the other hand,</v>

2565
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 4>like I remember at Boston University </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like the French house.</v>

2566
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 4>It was the gay house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was the,</v>

2567
01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black house.</v>

2568
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:14.791
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought the idea was that we're all </v>

2569
01:50:14.791 --> 01:50:14.791
<v Speaker 4>going to get together and mix it up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>get to know each other.</v>

2570
01:50:14.791 --> 01:50:17.200
<v Speaker 4>Why are we fucking secluding this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>segregation.</v>

2571
01:50:17.201 --> 01:50:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2572
01:50:18.370 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Certainly is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm against college.</v>

2573
01:50:20.171 --> 01:50:21.910
<v Speaker 4>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like my kids,</v>

2574
01:50:21.911 --> 01:50:26.911
<v Speaker 4>I've got a college savings account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got about two years paid for each </v>

2575
01:50:26.911 --> 01:50:30.481
<v Speaker 4>at this point and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm putting any more into </v>

2576
01:50:30.481 --> 01:50:30.481
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they turn 17,</v>

2577
01:50:30.481 --> 01:50:30.481
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go.</v>

2578
01:50:30.481 --> 01:50:35.310
<v Speaker 4>You get two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can fucking waste your brain for </v>

2579
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:37.000
<v Speaker 4>junior college or take this money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joined the circus,</v>

2580
01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:39.370
<v Speaker 4>go to Europe backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2581
01:50:39.371 --> 01:50:41.920
<v Speaker 4>But you're gonna you're gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2582
01:50:41.921 --> 01:50:46.921
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna explore challenge Louis Ck </v>
<v Speaker 4>is mom saved up all this money to send </v>

2583
01:50:46.921 --> 01:50:48.460
<v Speaker 4>them to college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when he had a chance,</v>

2584
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 4>he went to Nyu film school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got in,</v>

2585
01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.660
<v Speaker 4>looked around and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2586
01:50:52.661 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 4>I've got an idea for a short film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I take this money and make the film?</v>

2587
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:58.030
<v Speaker 4>I think I can learn more than I can at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the school.</v>

2588
01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.790
<v Speaker 4>And she thought about it and she gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>him the money.</v>

2589
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:03.340
<v Speaker 4>He made a short film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got into Sundance.</v>

2590
01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 4>He ended up as the head writer of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Conan O'brien show.</v>

2591
01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 4>And then Chris Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was like,</v>

2592
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:13.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other ways to make it in the </v>

2593
01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.331
<v Speaker 4>world if you really know what you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>besides going to college and being </v>

2594
01:51:15.331 --> 01:51:15.700
<v Speaker 4>fucking coddled for years.</v>

2595
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:18.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I always felt like just learning,</v>

2596
01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.460
<v Speaker 5>like sticking to their lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you,</v>

2597
01:51:21.461 --> 01:51:26.461
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have some sort of a base of </v>

2598
01:51:26.461 --> 01:51:28.981
<v Speaker 5>education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to express yourself </v>

2599
01:51:28.981 --> 01:51:31.921
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to understand </v>

2600
01:51:31.921 --> 01:51:31.921
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But once you get to a certain point when</v>

2601
01:51:31.921 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 5>you're 17 or 18 years old or you have an</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of something you want to do,</v>

2602
01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:37.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to be a gymnast,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's going to take up a lot of time.</v>

2607
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:50.870
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of your folks are doing your other </v>

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.230
<v Speaker 4>And and I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a great experience for me.</v>

2628
01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't have known it if I'd gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight in from high school.</v>

2629
01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:35.170
<v Speaker 4>And I also think that like a boss sees </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be offered earlier in high school</v>

2630
01:52:35.171 --> 01:52:37.620
<v Speaker 4>when you're a sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may know that you want to be.</v>

2631
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:39.450
<v Speaker 4>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New York they call it both sees.</v>

2632
01:52:39.451 --> 01:52:43.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like a vocational school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you know you don't want to learn</v>

2633
01:52:43.381 --> 01:52:48.381
<v Speaker 4>calculus and you're a sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can start going to cooking classes </v>

2634
01:52:48.381 --> 01:52:51.970
<v Speaker 4>are small engine repair and by the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>you graduated high school you're </v>

2635
01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:53.020
<v Speaker 4>qualified to be a chef or a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2636
01:52:53.021 --> 01:52:55.220
<v Speaker 4>a lead mechanic and eventually own a </v>
<v Speaker 4>shop.</v>

2637
01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people don't want their </v>

2638
01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.731
<v Speaker 2>kids to be boxed in like that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then if the kid grows up and then </v>

2639
01:53:01.731 --> 01:53:01.731
<v Speaker 2>eventually wants to actually go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>

2640
01:53:01.731 --> 01:53:04.710
<v Speaker 2>well now he doesn't even have the base </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it and he can't even compete.</v>

2641
01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:06.990
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still get your core classes done.</v>

2642
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But instead of learning,</v>

2643
01:53:08.551 --> 01:53:11.490
<v Speaker 4>say a second language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you have to do in high school,</v>

2644
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.880
<v Speaker 4>you sub out those for these folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go away like three days a week for </v>

2645
01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 4>half a day to a vocational place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Learn.</v>

2646
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:22.690
<v Speaker 4>Remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that you're saying that now I </v>

2647
01:53:22.690 --> 01:53:22.690
<v Speaker 4>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a slander,</v>

2648
01:53:22.690 --> 01:53:22.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>

2649
01:53:22.771 --> 01:53:22.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2650
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2651
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well who the fuck knows what they.</v>

2652
01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't figure out what I wanted until </v>

2653
01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I wanted to do,</v>

2654
01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't know until I started </v>

2655
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.350
<v Speaker 2>doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to college?</v>

2656
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I went to Umass Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2657
01:53:36.491 --> 01:53:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only went for three years and I only </v>

2659
01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:43.200
<v Speaker 2>went because I didn't want people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I was a loser.</v>

2660
01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only reason why I wanted it was </v>

2661
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:47.280
<v Speaker 2>barely paid attention,</v>

2662
01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.410
<v Speaker 4>a lot of money to not pay attention.</v>

2663
01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.150
<v Speaker 2>And it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know I was um,</v>

2664
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:52.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2665
01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I would be taking classes and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2666
01:53:54.481 --> 01:53:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2667
01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:58.020
<v Speaker 2>like one of them was a weird sociology </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

2668
01:53:58.410 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 2>This fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this guy because he </v>

2669
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 2>was from Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2670
01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 2>no matter what we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what we talked about when you </v>

2671
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 2>talked about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2672
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.870
<v Speaker 2>the philosophical works with Leonardo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Davinci,</v>

2673
01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.040
<v Speaker 2>whether it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2674
01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2675
01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>anything in was</v>

2676
01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:18.420
<v Speaker 4>skinhead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we would do is we would say this </v>

2677
01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:19.340
<v Speaker 4>and he would always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what the fuck we talked.</v>

2678
01:54:19.341 --> 01:54:20.920
<v Speaker 4>And so that would became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2679
01:54:20.921 --> 01:54:24.430
<v Speaker 4>all I could concentrate on was how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things this motherfucker could</v>

2680
01:54:24.431 --> 01:54:29.431
<v Speaker 4>connect to Haiti because he always </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to hear himself talk because I </v>

2681
01:54:29.431 --> 01:54:29.431
<v Speaker 4>think he was learning English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:54:29.431 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So while back in Haiti,</v>

2683
01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.990
<v Speaker 4>that's all he would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you just want to go,</v>

2684
01:54:34.991 --> 01:54:37.570
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not in Haiti for a reason.</v>

2685
01:54:37.571 --> 01:54:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Why are you trying to draw from that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2686
01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:40.510
<v Speaker 4>this is the new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2687
01:54:40.511 --> 01:54:44.230
<v Speaker 4>he would wear a tie and suit and tie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in college it's crazy.</v>

2688
01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

2689
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to argue about everything.</v>

2690
01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the fucking Haitians man,</v>

2691
01:54:48.791 --> 01:54:53.791
<v Speaker 4>they like to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I talked to my cab drivers </v>

2692
01:54:53.791 --> 01:54:53.791
<v Speaker 4>are either Haitian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to this guy,</v>

2693
01:54:53.791 --> 01:54:57.901
<v Speaker 4>he was a Iranian cab driver the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day and he's taking me back from the </v>

2694
01:54:57.901 --> 01:54:58.780
<v Speaker 4>airport and we start talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that.</v>

2695
01:54:58.780 --> 01:54:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to him about,</v>

2696
01:54:59.950 --> 01:55:00.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2697
01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:02.530
<v Speaker 4>whether or not he thinks that I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>typed,</v>

2698
01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:04.480
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bomb Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go right into it with them,</v>

2699
01:55:04.481 --> 01:55:05.650
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think we're going to bomb Iran?</v>

2700
01:55:06.330 --> 01:55:07.540
<v Speaker 4>We get into religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2701
01:55:07.541 --> 01:55:08.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2702
01:55:09.110 --> 01:55:11.470
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't be there because they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to.</v>

2703
01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:16.471
<v Speaker 4>He was a Muslim that they wanted you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe this and they couldn't accept </v>

2704
01:55:16.471 --> 01:55:17.200
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could just believe that it was exactly</v>

2705
01:55:17.201 --> 01:55:19.270
<v Speaker 4>the conversation we had earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 4>atheism.</v>

2706
01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:21.160
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a god.</v>

2707
01:55:21.190 --> 01:55:26.190
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that man has the capacity </v>

2708
01:55:26.190 --> 01:55:27.670
<v Speaker 4>to assign meaning to it or to understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2709
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.630
<v Speaker 4>And I would sit in the back on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an immigrant from Iran who drives</v>

2710
01:55:31.631 --> 01:55:36.631
<v Speaker 4>a cab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up upper middle class in New </v>

2711
01:55:36.631 --> 01:55:36.631
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>college educated.</v>

2712
01:55:36.631 --> 01:55:40.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm a comedian and I feel exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same way spiritually as this guy does.</v>

2713
01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking amazing to me.</v>

2714
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:44.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it all,</v>

2715
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.530
<v Speaker 4>when it doesn't matter what culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're from,</v>

2716
01:55:46.531 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 4>it transcends that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really,</v>

2717
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:49.890
<v Speaker 4>I think if somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you were saying,</v>

2718
01:55:49.891 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 4>if you really examine yourself when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're truthful about your,</v>

2719
01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:53.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2720
01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:56.820
<v Speaker 4>what your reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes out there.</v>

2721
01:55:56.821 --> 01:56:01.821
<v Speaker 4>There is one human experience I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And College to me is supposed to be a </v>

2722
01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:04.140
<v Speaker 4>place where they pull that shit out </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they say,</v>

2723
01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:09.141
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's four years we can give you a </v>

2724
01:56:09.141 --> 01:56:09.141
<v Speaker 4>place to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>place to eat now,</v>

2725
01:56:09.141 --> 01:56:10.380
<v Speaker 4>just fucking go to town on your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2726
01:56:10.610 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 4>someone needs to</v>

2727
01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.240
<v Speaker 5>develop a much more unconventional </v>
<v Speaker 5>method of teaching people where they </v>

2728
01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 5>truly can go towards things only that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're interested in and know you've </v>

2729
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.260
<v Speaker 5>got all your mathematics and everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

2730
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.810
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's.</v>

2731
01:56:20.811 --> 01:56:21.940
<v Speaker 5>This is instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2732
01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.330
<v Speaker 5>learning about history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>learning what,</v>

2733
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:26.320
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck do you want to learn about</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he will.</v>

2734
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:27.680
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is will die,</v>

2735
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:29.870
<v Speaker 5>will qualify you for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get really good at that.</v>

2736
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:31.940
<v Speaker 5>What are you interested in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're interested in this.</v>

2737
01:56:31.941 --> 01:56:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well let's take you down that road.</v>

2738
01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.930
<v Speaker 5>But so many people don't even get that </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity.</v>

2739
01:56:35.931 --> 01:56:38.270
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're forced to fit into a whole,</v>

2740
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:40.340
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a round hole or a square </v>
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>

2741
01:56:40.341 --> 01:56:43.280
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forced to conform to become whatever,</v>

2742
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:44.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck that hole is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2743
01:56:44.961 --> 01:56:46.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have people that were like,</v>

2744
01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:48.050
<v Speaker 5>that girl Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I was dating,</v>

2745
01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:50.900
<v Speaker 5>had a restaurant hotel management that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was her major.</v>

2746
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:56.350
<v Speaker 5>And that poor fucking girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she went from right out of college to </v>

2747
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:57.590
<v Speaker 5>working 16 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every fucking day.</v>

2748
01:56:57.830 --> 01:57:00.800
<v Speaker 5>She was always exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was always broken down.</v>

2749
01:57:00.801 --> 01:57:02.210
<v Speaker 5>And that's what she had to look forward </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2750
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:03.950
<v Speaker 5>All the people in the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hotel,</v>

2751
01:57:03.951 --> 01:57:08.951
<v Speaker 5>bar management world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking people would work for a </v>

2752
01:57:08.951 --> 01:57:09.020
<v Speaker 5>salary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One salary,</v>

2753
01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:11.330
<v Speaker 5>no one got paid overtime and your work </v>
<v Speaker 5>was never done.</v>

2754
01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:15.340
<v Speaker 4>And you spent four years not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're behind the people that started</v>

2755
01:57:15.341 --> 01:57:17.980
<v Speaker 4>doing the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

2756
01:57:17.981 --> 01:57:20.980
<v Speaker 4>It's also about technology and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>digital media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every information and,</v>

2758
01:57:23.501 --> 01:57:26.890
<v Speaker 4>and the progress of every industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes so fast.</v>

2759
01:57:27.190 --> 01:57:31.000
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're learning your industry from a guy</v>

2760
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:35.170
<v Speaker 4>who learned it before you started your </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning yesterday's industry.</v>

2761
01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:40.500
<v Speaker 4>And then you're going to try to go into </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers or you're going to try to go </v>

2762
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:40.500
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You go in and get these old acting </v>

2765
01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:46.000
<v Speaker 4>teachers that learned from status laskin</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're teaching,</v>

2766
01:57:46.001 --> 01:57:48.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeat an answer and repeat.</v>

2767
01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 4>I fucking suck it audition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent two years at the neighborhood </v>

2768
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:54.850
<v Speaker 4>playhouse in New York and I fucking suck</v>
<v Speaker 4>at auditioning.</v>

2769
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.140
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good actor,</v>

2770
01:57:56.170 --> 01:58:01.170
<v Speaker 4>but I don't get the chance because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking suck my own dick when I go into </v>

2771
01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:04.381
<v Speaker 4>a casting room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody taught me how to do that because </v>

2772
01:58:04.381 --> 01:58:07.951
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to teach you Russian </v>

2773
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:07.951
<v Speaker 4>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2774
01:58:07.951 --> 01:58:10.800
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same with every industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're learning the fucking dinosaur </v>

2775
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:10.800
<v Speaker 4>method of things.</v>

2776
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That used to be the way it was with </v>

2777
01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.170
<v Speaker 5>martial arts to the ultimate fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>championship sort of came around.</v>

2778
01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was learning this old style </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2779
01:58:17.181 --> 01:58:19.210
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of doing things where it had been.</v>

2780
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:21.650
<v Speaker 5>It already evolved past that should've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>

2781
01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.750
<v Speaker 5>Should've been in a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 5>stratosphere,</v>

2782
01:58:23.751 --> 01:58:28.751
<v Speaker 5>but everybody was holding onto the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional methods and no one was </v>

2783
01:58:28.751 --> 01:58:28.751
<v Speaker 5>exchanging information.</v>

2784
01:58:28.751 --> 01:58:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was the first person?</v>

2785
01:58:29.770 --> 01:58:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Who would you say is the first pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that kind of crossover?</v>

2786
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:36.000
<v Speaker 4>Mixed signals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Significant</v>

2787
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 5>guys hoists gracie because he was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy that won the first ultimate fighting</v>

2788
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:44.151
<v Speaker 5>championship and he won it in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 5>proved that a smaller man with more </v>

2789
01:58:44.151 --> 01:58:46.990
<v Speaker 5>skill could defeat a bigger man because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was always the goal of martial arts</v>

2790
01:58:46.991 --> 01:58:50.110
<v Speaker 5>was like the Bruce Lee thing where this </v>
<v Speaker 5>little guy could fuck up everybody,</v>

2791
01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:56.040
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is in striking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that really doesn't work because little </v>

2792
01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:56.440
<v Speaker 5>people can't hit us hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just can't.</v>

2793
01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:01.460
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The little guy who can kick kick you in </v>

2794
01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:01.460
<v Speaker 5>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2795
01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.890
<v Speaker 5>it can hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is most fights end up on</v>

2796
01:59:02.891 --> 01:59:07.891
<v Speaker 5>the ground and the little guy might </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw a kick and slip because the </v>

2797
01:59:07.891 --> 01:59:11.041
<v Speaker 5>fucking beer bottle fell on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's water everywhere and you </v>

2798
01:59:11.041 --> 01:59:12.910
<v Speaker 5>don't have the footing to throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking wild head kicks in the middle of</v>

2799
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:17.910
<v Speaker 5>a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when push comes to shove and tangle </v>

2800
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:20.160
<v Speaker 5>and you go to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have to understand how to </v>

2801
01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.661
<v Speaker 5>grapple and what the Jujitsu that hoists</v>
<v Speaker 5>gracie had when he fought in the UFC was</v>

2802
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Brazilian Jujitsu and no one here knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck that was.</v>

2803
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.850
<v Speaker 5>Dudes had no idea what that guy was.</v>

2804
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:30.200
<v Speaker 7>But UFC at that point was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was.</v>

2805
01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:32.960
<v Speaker 7>That was chain link fences and it lives </v>
<v Speaker 7>in another country,</v>

2806
01:59:32.961 --> 01:59:33.440
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2807
01:59:33.441 --> 01:59:34.340
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was denver,</v>

2808
01:59:34.341 --> 01:59:35.680
<v Speaker 7>Colorado was the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2809
01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.210
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was put together by Horian Gracie who</v>

2810
01:59:38.230 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 7>is his older brother who was a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a very smart guy.</v>

2811
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.230
<v Speaker 7>What year is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>About?</v>

2812
01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.820
<v Speaker 7>Nineteen 93.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:47.080
<v Speaker 5>And that changed everything because my </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole life I had been a striker,</v>

2814
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:52.081
<v Speaker 5>I'd done kickboxing and taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all striking and this was the </v>

2815
01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:53.890
<v Speaker 5>first time that I had seen like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>could happen with submissions.</v>

2816
01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:59.180
<v Speaker 5>I've wrestled in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I never really pursued it at much </v>

2817
01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:01.951
<v Speaker 5>after the one year in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never learned any choke hold or </v>

2818
02:00:01.951 --> 02:00:03.700
<v Speaker 5>anything like that and learn it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing this guy just dismantle people on</v>

2819
02:00:03.701 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 5>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be like,</v>

2820
02:00:04.421 --> 02:00:06.520
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what would I do?</v>

2821
02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:08.980
<v Speaker 5>All these other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these big strong guys getting strangled.</v>

2822
02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 5>What'd I do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He strangled me to,</v>

2823
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:12.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was inescapable conclusion.</v>

2824
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2825
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:18.481
<v Speaker 5>the inescapable conclusion is if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't know what this guy knew and you </v>

2826
02:00:18.481 --> 02:00:19.390
<v Speaker 5>got let him get ahold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked.</v>

2827
02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:20.340
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But.</v>

2828
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 7>So he changed it the most.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he changed it the most.</v>

2829
02:00:22.781 --> 02:00:24.850
<v Speaker 7>But in terms of like what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about,</v>

2830
02:00:24.851 --> 02:00:28.330
<v Speaker 7>which is that when you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you try to do things differently,</v>

2831
02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.440
<v Speaker 7>people will try to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2832
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:35.790
<v Speaker 7>UFC still.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's still trying to fight off the </v>

2833
02:00:35.790 --> 02:00:38.530
<v Speaker 7>stigma that it's this vicious back </v>
<v Speaker 7>alley,</v>

2834
02:00:38.531 --> 02:00:40.090
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not too brutal,</v>

2835
02:00:40.091 --> 02:00:43.060
<v Speaker 7>but it wasn't this year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of a big test for UFC.</v>

2836
02:00:43.061 --> 02:00:45.070
<v Speaker 7>Going to that next level and going on </v>
<v Speaker 7>network.</v>

2837
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:46.810
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because it came on Fox.</v>

2838
02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:50.740
<v Speaker 7>It is completely up the profile and </v>
<v Speaker 7>visit a success.</v>

2839
02:00:50.741 --> 02:00:51.490
<v Speaker 7>Did it succeed?</v>

2840
02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Fox is really enthusiastic about it.</v>

2841
02:00:53.941 --> 02:00:58.941
<v Speaker 5>They have a big longterm deal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've seen the UFC develop over the </v>

2842
02:00:58.941 --> 02:01:00.930
<v Speaker 5>years and it took a long time before </v>
<v Speaker 5>they got interested in,</v>

2843
02:01:00.931 --> 02:01:05.931
<v Speaker 5>but they got interested in it at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect time because the product is so </v>

2844
02:01:05.931 --> 02:01:06.000
<v Speaker 5>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The brand so developed.</v>

2845
02:01:06.001 --> 02:01:09.660
<v Speaker 5>The fighters are so high level now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the referees are great.</v>

<v Speaker 5>high.</v>

2847
02:01:12.121 --> 02:01:12.450
<v Speaker 5>As far as</v>

2848
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:15.160
<v Speaker 7>broadcasting is state of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's easiest.</v>

2849
02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:16.080
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the.</v>

2850
02:01:16.081 --> 02:01:21.081
<v Speaker 7>That's the easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Easy because you love it and you know </v>

2851
02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:21.081
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very easy.</v>

2852
02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:21.081
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a,</v>

2853
02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:21.330
<v Speaker 7>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a fun,</v>

2854
02:01:21.331 --> 02:01:24.840
<v Speaker 7>exciting thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's like for me it's natural.</v>

2855

2893
02:02:56.711 --> 02:02:56.711
<v Speaker 7>and we were playing pool when young </v>
<v Speaker 7>comics ask for advice,</v>

2894
02:02:56.711 --> 02:02:58.550
<v Speaker 7>I just want to say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>live a life,</v>

2896
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:03.230
<v Speaker 7>don't just fucking write notes and go on</v>
<v Speaker 7>stage and then,</v>

2897
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:08.470
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>talk about your cubicle job and go </v>

<v Speaker 7>they follow your path.</v>

2900
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:14.410
<v Speaker 7>You've always stayed with martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 7>and then all a sudden this thing comes </v>

2901
02:03:14.410 --> 02:03:15.830
<v Speaker 7>up and it wasn't lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was the fact that you had.</v>

2902
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 7>I'm honored your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your passion.</v>

2903
02:03:18.710 --> 02:03:20.990

2904
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:23.270
<v Speaker 7>And that's what I say to young comics.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like go,</v>

2905
02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm into.</v>

2908
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:29.780
<v Speaker 7>I talk about it onstage and you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see people go,</v>

2909
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:30.740
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to be one of those.</v>

2910
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:35.770
<v Speaker 7>Go talk about my kids on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like it doesn't matter when I talk </v>

2911
02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:37.490
<v Speaker 7>about I'm saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anybody can make a topic interesting.</v>

2912
02:03:37.491 --> 02:03:40.400
<v Speaker 7>If it's truthful and real.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a weird thing that people do when</v>

2913
02:03:40.401 --> 02:03:43.070
<v Speaker 7>they believe that somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you talk about children,</v>

2914
02:03:43.071 --> 02:03:46.340
<v Speaker 7>like all of a sudden you've fallen into </v>
<v Speaker 7>this soul sell out,</v>

2915
02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 7>like really pacified sort of a wishy </v>
<v Speaker 7>washy sort of stand up.</v>

2916
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:56.410
<v Speaker 7>Like you abandoned the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 7>anything could actually be really funny </v>

2917
02:03:56.410 --> 02:03:58.460
<v Speaker 7>about having kids when in fact it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>funny shit that happens all the time.</v>

2918
02:03:58.480 --> 02:03:59.780
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well not just funny,</v>

2919
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:01.220
<v Speaker 7>but it's perspective.</v>

2920
02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:02.560
<v Speaker 7>It's existential,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2921
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:07.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean you're talking about life here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's going to get any deeper than </v>

2922
02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:07.570
<v Speaker 7>having looking at your son.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2923

<v Speaker 7>I'm going through this thing now where </v>
<v Speaker 7>my kid is like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I don't fucking do.</v>

2932
02:04:28.541 --> 02:04:29.430
<v Speaker 7>Don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who?</v>

2933
02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.880
<v Speaker 7>I'm the opposite of that Short,</v>
<v Speaker 7>scrawny,</v>

2934
02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 7>horrible athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Horrible fucking student.</v>

2935
02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it's the hormones and the beef </v>
<v Speaker 7>could be.</v>

2936
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.190
<v Speaker 7>It could be.</v>

2937
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Kids are getting way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are 100 percent.</v>

2938
02:04:40.771 --> 02:04:41.150
<v Speaker 5>They're bigger.</v>

2939
02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:45.260
<v Speaker 7>The girls are having their periods and </v>
<v Speaker 7>so I'm going through this thing.</v>

2940
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:46.280
<v Speaker 7>Land Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good dad.</v>

2941
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.970
<v Speaker 7>You raised them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2942
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.260
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a good sign.</v>

2943
02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.630
<v Speaker 7>It is a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm proud of that and it's also.</v>

2944
02:04:50.631 --> 02:04:52.070
<v Speaker 7>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a great premise.</v>

2945
02:04:52.071 --> 02:04:57.071
<v Speaker 7>Like I know my kid's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>stronger and smarter than me soon and </v>

2946
02:04:57.071 --> 02:04:57.560
<v Speaker 7>it's fucking scary and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 7>think,</v>

2947
02:04:57.561 --> 02:04:58.610
<v Speaker 7>how do I hide it from,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2948
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.590
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to just be a great dad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to look my.</v>

2949
02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:04.580
<v Speaker 7>You're using a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was a few late.</v>

2950
02:05:04.581 --> 02:05:05.420
<v Speaker 7>I'll hit me back.</v>

2951
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:07.430
<v Speaker 5>Getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was always a,</v>

2952
02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:12.460
<v Speaker 5>these old martial arts guys that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>around that were treated with great </v>

2953
02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:12.460
<v Speaker 5>reverence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2954
02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:13.540
<v Speaker 5>you could easily kick their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're old,</v>

2955
02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:18.740
<v Speaker 5>they're old and broken down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you never thought of that because </v>

2956
02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:18.770
<v Speaker 5>you had always developed great reverence</v>
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>

2957
02:05:18.771 --> 02:05:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Just as long as you develop respect your</v>
<v Speaker 5>kid,</v>

2958
02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:23.670
<v Speaker 5>your kid's never going to challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to deal with it.</v>

2959
02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:24.170
<v Speaker 7>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never.</v>

2960
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:29.270
<v Speaker 7>It's a very based biological.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's just like a real in the </v>

2961
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.350
<v Speaker 7>wild kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is a little bit,</v>

2962
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:34.390
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you just got to calm that down by </v>

2963
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.390
<v Speaker 5>letting them know that you're on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>team,</v>

2964
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and letting them know that everything </v>

2965
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:37.800
<v Speaker 5>that you do to discipline him is only </v>
<v Speaker 5>for his own development.</v>

2966
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:42.251
<v Speaker 5>It seems weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you went through it just as much as </v>

2967
02:05:42.251 --> 02:05:42.251
<v Speaker 5>he is.</v>

2968
02:05:42.251 --> 02:05:42.251
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2969
02:05:42.251 --> 02:05:43.090
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it is hard because as the dad,</v>

2970
02:05:43.091 --> 02:05:45.850
<v Speaker 7>and I don't know how deep you are into </v>
<v Speaker 7>that part is like,</v>

2971
02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:48.280
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I have to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2972
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:53.350
<v Speaker 7>it's a role.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She ended up being the disciplinarian </v>

2973
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.350
<v Speaker 7>more than my wife does.</v>

2974
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

2975
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2976
02:05:53.841 --> 02:05:58.841
<v Speaker 5>there's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a yin and a Yang and there's a </v>

2977
02:05:58.841 --> 02:05:58.880
<v Speaker 5>mom and dad and just the way it is and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2978
02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:00.470
<v Speaker 5>you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2979
02:06:00.471 --> 02:06:02.540
<v Speaker 5>my point of view is you should be as </v>
<v Speaker 5>loving as possible,</v>

2980
02:06:02.541 --> 02:06:06.950
<v Speaker 5>but the shit stops with me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how it's always supposed to be.</v>

2981
02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:08.570
<v Speaker 5>That's how it isn't a fucking gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 5>colony.</v>

2982
02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:09.450

<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

2983
02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:13.020
<v Speaker 5>when everybody's going crazy and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>swinging off trees and the grill goes,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can learn a lot about parenting from</v>

2987
02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:22.290
<v Speaker 7>the dog guy.</v>

<v Speaker 7>well say takes the dog.</v>

2990
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:28.130
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Now I just knew this whole pack </v>

<v Speaker 7>He just taps him on the side.</v>

2993
02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:33.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2994
02:06:33.841 --> 02:06:36.180
<v Speaker 5>He heals them in the gut and if you did </v>
<v Speaker 5>it to me,</v>

2995
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:39.750
<v Speaker 5>I'd punch him in his fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reality kick is a kick.</v>

2996

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>people don't want to hear.</v>

2998
02:06:43.591 --> 02:06:45.510
<v Speaker 5>You have to be physical with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2999
02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 5>I know I never hit my dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I used to raise pit bulls and the </v>

3000
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 5>one thing you have to do is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominate.</v>

3001
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.530
<v Speaker 5>Those motherfuckers are used to slam on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their back.</v>

3002
02:06:52.531 --> 02:06:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I used to mount them and bite them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bite their face and yell at them because</v>

3003
02:06:55.981 --> 02:07:00.981
<v Speaker 5>if they growl at you a little man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to cease and desist that when </v>

3004
02:07:00.981 --> 02:07:01.260
<v Speaker 5>they're a puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to make sure that you make them</v>

3005
02:07:01.261 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 5>know that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are dominant over them,</v>

3006
02:07:03.541 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 5>but you're loving to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you control them?</v>

02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:06.570
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Punctured skin on my back.</v>

3028
02:07:53.101 --> 02:07:55.500
<v Speaker 4>it's funny you bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason my son's in taekwondo,</v>

3029
02:07:55.590 --> 02:07:57.240
<v Speaker 4>he used to bite other kids when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like three.</v>

3030
02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.360
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are we going to do when </v>

3031
02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.741
<v Speaker 4>someone is at taekwondo?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll teach them discipline piece and </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3034
02:08:09.291 --> 02:08:09.291
<v Speaker 4>well-disciplined kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's all,</v>

3036
02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.720
<v Speaker 4>it's all on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This thing with my son.</v>

3037
02:08:12.721 --> 02:08:15.090
<v Speaker 4>I know that it's a psychological thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just.</v>

3038
02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:20.180
<v Speaker 4>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be embarrassed to think that and I </v>

3039
02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:23.571
<v Speaker 4>say it out loud and I do talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>onstage because to me that's what stand </v>

3040
02:08:23.571 --> 02:08:27.491
<v Speaker 4>up is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the thing I'm most embarrassed </v>

3041
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:27.491
<v Speaker 4>about in my life right now at a deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

3042
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:29.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've a very oedipal feeling right now,</v>

3043
02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:34.160
<v Speaker 4>which is a real thing that dads go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through with sons is you start to my </v>

3044
02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:34.620
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt that my dad,</v>

3045
02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:37.770
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's a kid</v>

3046
02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:46.080
<v Speaker 5>fairly might be a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3047
02:08:46.081 --> 02:08:48.510
<v Speaker 5>And that was start taking Jujitsu now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep him away.</v>

3048
02:08:48.511 --> 02:08:50.640
<v Speaker 5>And you start lifting.</v>

3049
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Now I believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see only good things for us in our </v>

3050
02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:55.710
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a,</v>

3051
02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:55.710
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird emotion.</v>

3052
02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:56.840
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3053
02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:01.360
<v Speaker 5>my friend Rick has two kids that are 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and 18 now and he's like to get both be.</v>

3054
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:05.790
<v Speaker 5>He has this relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good.</v>

3055
02:09:06.090 --> 02:09:06.560
<v Speaker 5>Used to go</v>

3056
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>period in their late teens when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hated you and I don't think they</v>

3057
02:09:10.201 --> 02:09:15.201
<v Speaker 4>do as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think parents are better now and I </v>

3058
02:09:15.201 --> 02:09:17.961
<v Speaker 4>think there's obviously that pull away </v>
<v Speaker 4>part where they have to find themselves </v>

3059
02:09:17.961 --> 02:09:17.961
<v Speaker 4>among their friends more than their </v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

3060
02:09:17.961 --> 02:09:19.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's not that violent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate you.</v>

3061
02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:25.460
<v Speaker 5>I think there was a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I said so when we were growing </v>

3062
02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:25.460
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

3063
02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:27.410
<v Speaker 5>Give me a goddamn x and now I think you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3064
02:09:27.550 --> 02:09:30.070
<v Speaker 5>because enough generations get through </v>
<v Speaker 5>that where you say,</v>

3065
02:09:30.071 --> 02:09:32.140
<v Speaker 5>I am not going to do that stupid shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I have kids.</v>

3066
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:34.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to respect my kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>

3067
02:09:34.181 --> 02:09:39.181
<v Speaker 5>Like I have like long conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter about why it's wrong to do </v>

3068
02:09:39.221 --> 02:09:41.650
<v Speaker 5>this and this is what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when you do that,</v>

3069
02:09:41.651 --> 02:09:46.651
<v Speaker 5>I know you feel like it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you heard other people's feelings </v>

3070
02:09:46.651 --> 02:09:48.280
<v Speaker 5>and you should always avoid hurting </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people's feelings.</v>

3071
02:09:48.281 --> 02:09:51.660
<v Speaker 5>If you can write right and then we'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a long,</v>

3072
02:09:51.661 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody ever did that with me was because</v>

3073
02:09:55.181 --> 02:09:58.040
<v Speaker 5>I fucking said so go to your room and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3074
02:09:58.090 --> 02:10:00.400
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we got when we were kids.</v>

3075
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:05.630
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was educated on how to </v>

3076
02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:07.741
<v Speaker 5>psychologically properly evaluate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to raise children because their </v>

3077
02:10:07.741 --> 02:10:09.250
<v Speaker 5>parents grew up in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression when you had it.</v>

3078
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:11.780
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather used to tell stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>about breaking rabbits.</v>

3079
02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you break a rabbit's neck,</v>

3080
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 5>put a pot to make rabbit stew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3081
02:10:16.181 --> 02:10:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hate rabbits.</v>

3082
02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.510
<v Speaker 5>The fuck was wrong with the world back </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

3083
02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:22.000
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my grandfather living on a farm,</v>

3084
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:24.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a young boy in Italy.</v>

3085
02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:25.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she had to do.</v>

3086
02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:28.960
<v Speaker 4>There was no getting around that growing</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in a Catholic country like that.</v>

3087
02:10:28.961 --> 02:10:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a,</v>

3088
02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 4>there's an intense shame that's put upon</v>
<v Speaker 4>you a young age.</v>

3089
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3090
02:10:34.311 --> 02:10:37.430
<v Speaker 4>you're taught at an early age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're born into original sin,</v>

3091
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Adam and he fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're bad and dirty starting out and</v>

3092
02:10:42.441 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 4>then you get to a sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3093
02:10:45.441 --> 02:10:50.441
<v Speaker 4>Jesus came out of an immaculate </v>
<v Speaker 4>conception because any woman that </v>

3094
02:10:50.441 --> 02:10:51.050
<v Speaker 4>actually fucks to make a human life is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>whore.</v>

3095
02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:56.200
<v Speaker 4>She had to be pure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all these images that you may not </v>

3096
02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:59.981
<v Speaker 4>even processed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they get into your hard drive when </v>

<v Speaker 4>shame on us.</v>

3098
02:10:59.981 --> 02:11:00.070

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3099
02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I was raised with it and it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest thing</v>

3100
02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the guilt is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The east coast is main curse.</v>

3101
02:11:05.970 --> 02:11:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things most fucked up </v>

3102
02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:12.671
<v Speaker 2>about the east coast is the wave of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic guilt that is just polluted or </v>

3103
02:11:12.671 --> 02:11:16.381
<v Speaker 2>the consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consciousness of all the different </v>

3104
02:11:16.381 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 2>people there and think about what our </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandparents went through.</v>

3105
02:11:16.461 --> 02:11:21.461
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean our parents were raised by our </v>

3106
02:11:21.461 --> 02:11:22.520
<v Speaker 2>grandparents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our grandparents lived in the dark ages.</v>

3107
02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lived in an area with no fucking </v>

3108
02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:30.251
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no nothing when they were </v>

3109
02:11:30.251 --> 02:11:30.251
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no nothing there.</v>

3110
02:11:30.251 --> 02:11:34.551
<v Speaker 2>There was the written word and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you would see a photo of </v>

3111
02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3112
02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:36.980
<v Speaker 2>know I mean Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3113
02:11:37.130 --> 02:11:40.190
<v Speaker 2>imagine what was like growing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally at the turn of the century,</v>

3114
02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:42.860
<v Speaker 2>1900 mean fuck</v>

3115
02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:45.650
<v Speaker 4>you didn't travel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had no outside influences,</v>

3116
02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:50.660
<v Speaker 4>so whatever you were taught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's by the church or by your </v>

3117
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.410
<v Speaker 4>parents that were living in fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was your whole reality.</v>

3118
02:11:52.411 --> 02:11:54.100
<v Speaker 4>You had nothing to balance that out so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3119
02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:59.140
<v Speaker 4>you bought it even more so than maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was affected by a Catholic upbringing </v>

3120
02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:00.720
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no separation between what you</v>

3121
02:12:00.721 --> 02:12:03.600
<v Speaker 4>were living and anything outside in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world</v>

3122
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:07.710
<v Speaker 2>and my grandparents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what generation you are all</v>

3123
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:09.570
<v Speaker 2>came over from Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandparents.</v>

3124
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine as well.</v>

3125
02:12:10.811 --> 02:12:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather came over from Ireland on</v>

3126
02:12:13.511 --> 02:12:18.511
<v Speaker 2>my father's side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother on my father's side came </v>

3127
02:12:18.511 --> 02:12:21.421
<v Speaker 2>over from Italy and both my grandparents</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my mother's side came over from </v>

3128
02:12:21.421 --> 02:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everybody took a fucking crazy chance</v>

3129
02:12:21.911 --> 02:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>and jumped in a boat when across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

3130
02:12:23.801 --> 02:12:27.230
<v Speaker 2>So they were not the nuttiest fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

3131
02:12:27.610 --> 02:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even know what stories people</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you.</v>

3132
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to see a picture of what New </v>

3133
02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:36.770
<v Speaker 2>York City looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took a fucking chance like animals,</v>

3134
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:37.020
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

3135
02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second you step off the boat,</v>

3136
02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:42.520
<v Speaker 4>maybe you got a piece of paper with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>address somewhere in the city.</v>

3137
02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:45.040
<v Speaker 4>You've never fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've never found your way in a foreign</v>

3138
02:12:45.041 --> 02:12:50.041
<v Speaker 4>place in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You grew up in one town that you never </v>

3139
02:12:50.041 --> 02:12:52.381
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're surfing Manhattan trying to </v>

3140
02:12:52.381 --> 02:12:52.381
<v Speaker 4>find Second Avenue East.</v>

3141
02:12:52.381 --> 02:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Crazy and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've never seen the gangs of New </v>

3142
02:12:56.260 --> 02:12:59.560
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't know what Manhattan </v>

3143
02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:02.711
<v Speaker 2>used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of assume somehow that it </v>

3144
02:13:02.711 --> 02:13:03.010
<v Speaker 2>was always this city at the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>

3145
02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was craziness.</v>

3146
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Who was a nutty village.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really feudalism gangs of New </v>

3147
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.460
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

3148
02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:13.040
<v Speaker 2>That was really what it was like back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then and it's.</v>

3149
02:13:13.041 --> 02:13:18.041
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sort of puts the whole idea of </v>

3150
02:13:18.041 --> 02:13:21.431
<v Speaker 2>settling this country into perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most people can't really wrap </v>

3151
02:13:21.431 --> 02:13:25.751
<v Speaker 2>their heads around how quickly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States has developed the idea </v>

3152
02:13:25.751 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 2>that 17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>76 it was formed that that's nothing.</v>

3153
02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:32.190
<v Speaker 2>That is like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing here.</v>

3154
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:35.160
<v Speaker 5>A few houses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you fucking log houses here and there</v>

3155
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 5>and then all of a sudden in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred years,</v>

3156
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:40.000
<v Speaker 5>wash everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Manhattan,</v>

3157
02:13:40.050 --> 02:13:44.280
<v Speaker 5>fucking Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chicago fucking roads all the way across</v>

3158
02:13:44.281 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 5>this bitch back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Covered in.</v>

3159
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:50.770
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Horace flying over freaking me out right</v>

3160
02:13:50.771 --> 02:13:55.771
<v Speaker 9>now.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The fact that that happens over looking </v>

3161
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:56.440
<v Speaker 9>at your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

3162
02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 9>Holy Shit.</v>

3163
02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:59.740
<v Speaker 5>One hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 years.</v>

3164
02:13:59.741 --> 02:14:04.741
<v Speaker 5>It went from that to 1776 to 1976,</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 years</v>

3165
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:07.330
<v Speaker 4>and then you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is my always my thing,</v>

3166
02:14:07.331 --> 02:14:07.850
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

3167
02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:09.520
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people need to get over it.</v>

3168
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:11.740
<v Speaker 4>There were slaves too to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>generations ago.</v>

3169
02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:17.130
<v Speaker 4>That's a short period of time to expect </v>
<v Speaker 4>an entire culture of people to recover </v>

3170
02:14:18.311 --> 02:14:23.311
<v Speaker 4>from a really fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You talk about Catholicism being fucked </v>

3171
02:14:23.311 --> 02:14:24.850
<v Speaker 4>up two generations ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about your mother?</v>

3172
02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.790
<v Speaker 4>Your grandmother was getting raped and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3173
02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:30.100
<v Speaker 4>your father and mother were split up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your aunts and uncles were splitter.</v>

3174
02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:32.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a lie and the grant.</v>

3175
02:14:32.171 --> 02:14:37.171
<v Speaker 4>Granted I'm not like A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think affirmative action was a </v>

3176
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:38.440
<v Speaker 4>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're grappling with how to</v>

3177
02:14:38.441 --> 02:14:42.520
<v Speaker 4>try to equalize society for all people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the answer,</v>

3178
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:45.250
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that it did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to look at is our problem.</v>

3179
02:14:45.251 --> 02:14:46.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not their problem.</v>

3180
02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:48.570
<v Speaker 5>I think it has to do with poverty in </v>
<v Speaker 5>general.</v>

3181
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:53.690
<v Speaker 5>I think we have to address poverty from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the standpoint of children's being </v>

3182
02:14:53.690 --> 02:14:53.820
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being raised in children's,</v>

3183
02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:55.260
<v Speaker 5>children's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>children's,</v>

3184
02:14:55.310 --> 02:15:00.310
<v Speaker 5>being raised in a bad community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think children being raised in poverty</v>

3185
02:15:00.631 --> 02:15:03.410
<v Speaker 5>and neglect is always the big issue </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you're,</v>

3186
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.920
<v Speaker 5>if you don't do something about those </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

3187
02:15:04.921 --> 02:15:09.921
<v Speaker 5>now you are just essentially you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to give them no choice but to </v>

3188
02:15:09.921 --> 02:15:13.431
<v Speaker 5>become criminals themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're being raised in the </v>

3189
02:15:13.431 --> 02:15:13.431
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the imitate their atmosphere,</v>

3190
02:15:13.431 --> 02:15:17.541
<v Speaker 5>everything around them is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything around them is negative and </v>

3191
02:15:17.541 --> 02:15:17.790
<v Speaker 5>neglect and what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is.</v>

3192
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.570
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3193
02:15:18.571 --> 02:15:23.571
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be a way to get to those </v>

3194
02:15:23.571 --> 02:15:26.091
<v Speaker 5>kids to get to those kids and help them </v>
<v Speaker 5>see some something where it helps their </v>

3195
02:15:26.091 --> 02:15:26.910
<v Speaker 5>parents or some sort of a community </v>
<v Speaker 5>outreach.</v>

3196
02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:30.840
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that people at the top say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why should I give them anything?</v>

3197
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:33.300
<v Speaker 5>Fucking single mom just wants to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>more kids and like,</v>

3198
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:35.670
<v Speaker 5>well don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't there a root cause of that,</v>

3199
02:15:35.671 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 5>that single mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but someone's baby at one point,</v>

3200
02:15:37.570 --> 02:15:42.570
<v Speaker 5>obviously someone fuck that baby up bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it became a grown adult that just </v>

3201
02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:47.331
<v Speaker 5>shits out kids for welfare money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are we going to do is get to </v>

3202
02:15:47.331 --> 02:15:50.241
<v Speaker 5>them when they're babies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to them when they're babies and </v>

3203
02:15:50.241 --> 02:15:51.480
<v Speaker 5>help them help the mother help for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sake of the humanity as a whole,</v>

3204
02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:54.000
<v Speaker 5>as a super organism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Officially.</v>

3205
02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:54.540
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

3206
02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:00.680
<v Speaker 4>Service is very often I find that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a short sightedness if they're the.</v>

3207
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:05.390
<v Speaker 4>They're the party of economic restraint </v>
<v Speaker 4>and responsibility.</v>

3208
02:16:05.690 --> 02:16:10.690
<v Speaker 4>I think that you're creating a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficit and you're creating a more </v>

3209
02:16:10.690 --> 02:16:12.650
<v Speaker 4>fragile economy when you have people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are uneducated,</v>

3210
02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:13.940
<v Speaker 4>that grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

3211
02:16:13.941 --> 02:16:18.941
<v Speaker 4>in an atmosphere where they were abused </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't have the tools and </v>

3212
02:16:18.941 --> 02:16:20.120
<v Speaker 4>they're role models were shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you allow that to happen,</v>

3213
02:16:20.121 --> 02:16:23.240
<v Speaker 4>it's a drain selfishly on your economy.</v>

3214
02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolute fucking Luli and on your </v>

3215
02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:28.320
<v Speaker 5>safety,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your economy and your safety,</v>

3216
02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:32.970
<v Speaker 5>investing in the of inner cities and </v>
<v Speaker 5>building the bad neighborhoods and </v>

3217
02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:37.351
<v Speaker 5>turning them into better neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 5>and giving people a chance and hope and </v>

3218
02:16:37.351 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 5>giving them a possibility of positively </v>
<v Speaker 5>contributing to society.</v>

3219
02:16:38.741 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 5>So instead of being a burden there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something</v>

3220
02:16:41.590 --> 02:16:42.770
<v Speaker 4>anybody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3221
02:16:43.130 --> 02:16:44.490
<v Speaker 4>root of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3222
02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:49.500
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to these studies is the most </v>

3223
02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:52.631
<v Speaker 4>that you can boil it down to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's this guy that wrote a book </v>

3224
02:16:52.631 --> 02:16:52.631
<v Speaker 4>called happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>

3225
02:16:52.631 --> 02:16:56.231
<v Speaker 4>he teaches a class at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most attended class in the </v>

3226
02:16:56.231 --> 02:16:59.861
<v Speaker 4>history of Harvard University and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that's taken every type of thought </v>

3227
02:16:59.861 --> 02:17:03.911
<v Speaker 4>going back to fucking Confucius and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus and young and then modern </v>

3228
02:17:03.911 --> 02:17:08.471
<v Speaker 4>psychiatry and basically just studied it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a decade and come up with basically </v>

3229
02:17:08.510 --> 02:17:13.510
<v Speaker 4>happiness is pursuing something that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>care about and feeling vital.</v>

3230
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:16.820
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Welfare.</v>

3231
02:17:16.850 --> 02:17:19.880
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to fucking welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check to re to be a single mom.</v>

3232
02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.580
<v Speaker 4>People want to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to feel that they,</v>

3233
02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:25.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are making an imprint on the earth.</v>

3234
02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:30.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some some sort of a community </v>

3235
02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:32.471
<v Speaker 5>outreach with me and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to have things that help </v>

3236
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:35.891
<v Speaker 5>people get off drugs just for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be people that are </v>

3237
02:17:35.891 --> 02:17:39.101
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and they're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to make positive decisions because </v>

3238
02:17:39.101 --> 02:17:39.200
<v Speaker 5>they're on drugs and if that's your </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>

3239
02:17:39.201 --> 02:17:41.240
<v Speaker 5>if that's your community events,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your neighborhood,</v>

3240
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:43.970
<v Speaker 5>it's within your best interest to clean </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people up.</v>

3241
02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:49.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when the war on drugs now heading </v>

3242
02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:50.400
<v Speaker 4>off the off the need to do drugs is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3243
02:17:50.401 --> 02:17:53.070
<v Speaker 4>What does that treat treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not incarcerated.</v>

3244
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not and not judging people and the more </v>

3245
02:17:58.110 --> 02:18:00.871
<v Speaker 5>things are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more people are going to do those </v>

3246
02:18:00.871 --> 02:18:02.821
<v Speaker 5>illegal things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always been the case and at least </v>

3247
02:18:02.821 --> 02:18:02.821
<v Speaker 5>if you had legality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could.</v>

3248
02:18:02.821 --> 02:18:07.770
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should always be a social pariah and </v>

3249
02:18:07.770 --> 02:18:11.131
<v Speaker 5>you should boycott any fucking company </v>
<v Speaker 5>that would profit off the sale of those </v>

3250
02:18:11.131 --> 02:18:11.131
<v Speaker 5>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should be you,</v>

3251
02:18:11.131 --> 02:18:15.630
<v Speaker 5>the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any drugs that you sell the fuck people </v>

3252
02:18:15.630 --> 02:18:18.511
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The negative stigma should be the </v>

3253
02:18:18.511 --> 02:18:20.311
<v Speaker 5>punishment enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be disassociated by society </v>

3254
02:18:20.311 --> 02:18:23.080
<v Speaker 5>if you choose to sell and something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to cause people to fuck up </v>

3255
02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:26.521
<v Speaker 5>their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all know that there's drugs that </v>

3256
02:18:26.521 --> 02:18:28.561
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And anybody who's selling math is a </v>

3257
02:18:28.561 --> 02:18:28.561
<v Speaker 5>piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 2012.</v>

3258
02:18:28.561 --> 02:18:28.561
<v Speaker 5>We've got info,</v>

3259
02:18:28.561 --> 02:18:32.110
<v Speaker 4>but there's always going to be a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>hillbilly.</v>

3260
02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Cocaine is always going to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>a meal.</v>

3261
02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Ammonia mixed with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets you high.</v>

3262
02:18:36.370 --> 02:18:39.310
<v Speaker 4>So to me it's about how do we cut out </v>
<v Speaker 4>the abuse?</v>

3263
02:18:39.430 --> 02:18:44.430
<v Speaker 4>How do we cut out the loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uselessness that creates a need for </v>

3264
02:18:44.430 --> 02:18:46.000
<v Speaker 4>drug use or alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol is the fucking,</v>

3265
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:48.560
<v Speaker 4>that's the unsung hero of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3266
02:18:48.561 --> 02:18:51.280
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worse than drugs and yet it's on in</v>

3267
02:18:51.281 --> 02:18:53.360
<v Speaker 4>the superbowl and it's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3268
02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

3269
02:18:54.011 --> 02:18:55.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go down that road </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's a whole other.</v>

3270
02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's awesome.</v>

3271
02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:58.750
<v Speaker 5>When you changed as a person when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were young,</v>

3272
02:18:58.751 --> 02:19:01.030
<v Speaker 5>you got much more serious about your </v>
<v Speaker 5>career as well.</v>

3273
02:19:01.031 --> 02:19:02.950
<v Speaker 5>When you quit drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3274
02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:03.880
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you went,</v>

3275
02:19:03.881 --> 02:19:05.590
<v Speaker 5>you were the first guy that I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3276
02:19:05.591 --> 02:19:07.900
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you handled it great because you didn't,</v>

3277
02:19:08.170 --> 02:19:09.490
<v Speaker 5>you didn't waver at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3278
02:19:09.491 --> 02:19:10.630
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't drink.</v>

3279
02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:12.430
<v Speaker 5>I drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get fucked up.</v>

3280
02:19:12.431 --> 02:19:14.350
<v Speaker 5>I can't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

3281
02:19:14.650 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

3282
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:18.850
<v Speaker 5>And you did that when you were like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>22.</v>

3283
02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:24.300
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was probably 24 when I did it and it </v>

3284
02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:24.300
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3285
02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:24.360
<v Speaker 4>I had started drinking very young and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3286
02:19:24.361 --> 02:19:29.361
<v Speaker 4>but it was stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I couldn't drive to gigs if I </v>

3287
02:19:29.361 --> 02:19:30.350
<v Speaker 4>lost my license and stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the first thing in my life I ever</v>

3288
02:19:30.351 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 4>felt like I might be good at what I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3289
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has been my dream since I was a kid</v>

3290
02:19:34.971 --> 02:19:35.550
<v Speaker 4>to be a standup.</v>

3291
02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:36.780
<v Speaker 5>So you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3292
02:19:36.781 --> 02:19:41.640
<v Speaker 5>you're not a stranger when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the polls of addiction and the idea that</v>

3293
02:19:41.641 --> 02:19:44.220
<v Speaker 5>it could ruin your life and think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you didn't have stand up?</v>

3294
02:19:44.490 --> 02:19:49.490
<v Speaker 5>What if you know you were in a pit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>despair with a shit job and no future </v>

3295
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:52.740
<v Speaker 5>aspirations or hopes you know nothing on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the landscape.</v>

3296
02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:53.850
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man,</v>

3297
02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you need an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be a compelling option </v>

3298
02:19:58.900 --> 02:19:59.820
<v Speaker 4>because getting high feels fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

3299
02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:03.840
<v Speaker 4>Nobody can deny that and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel great and you can feel great,</v>

3300
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:08.990
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the only thing that feels better is </v>

3301
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:11.930
<v Speaker 4>feeling like people are expecting you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>produce something and you do it and you </v>

3302
02:20:11.930 --> 02:20:11.930
<v Speaker 4>feel good.</v>

3303
02:20:11.930 --> 02:20:12.310
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially as an artist,</v>

3304
02:20:12.311 --> 02:20:13.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I hate that word,</v>

3305
02:20:13.751 --> 02:20:15.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an artist,</v>

3306
02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:20.490
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but putting out something that you </v>

3307
02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:20.490
<v Speaker 5>create,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people enjoy,</v>

3308
02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:20.490
<v Speaker 5>they love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's like this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Terence Mckenna,</v>

3321
02:20:47.231 --> 02:20:47.770
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3322
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:52.830
<v Speaker 5>every week there's some new really cool </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking interesting lecture by some </v>

3323
02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:54.460
<v Speaker 5>really educated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trippy people,</v>

3324
02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:55.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3325
02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:57.670
<v Speaker 5>it's really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I look at my Ipod,</v>

3326
02:20:57.671 --> 02:20:59.610
<v Speaker 5>when I sync my ipod on like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3327
02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:00.330
<v Speaker 4>keep looking,</v>

3328
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:02.300
<v Speaker 5>you get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3329
02:21:02.301 --> 02:21:04.670
<v Speaker 5>it's like now I know what I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in my car.</v>

3330
02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.980
<v Speaker 5>It syncs up with my car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm driving around,</v>

3331
02:21:06.981 --> 02:21:08.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm listening to it and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

3332
02:21:08.961 --> 02:21:13.961
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a treat that you can get for </v>

3333
02:21:13.961 --> 02:21:13.961
<v Speaker 5>free.</v>

3334
02:21:13.961 --> 02:21:17.140
<v Speaker 4>And they've been pretty good feeling to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that people feel like that when </v>

3335
02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:18.150
<v Speaker 4>they see your podcast going down.</v>

3336
02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:23.390
<v Speaker 5>And for Brian and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a particularly satisfying because </v>

3337
02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:24.160
<v Speaker 5>we didn't have any aspirations at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>

3338
02:21:24.210 --> 02:21:29.210
<v Speaker 5>we started it off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see the first one's still </v>

3339
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:29.210
<v Speaker 5>available and ustream was with a laptop </v>
<v Speaker 5>is terrible.</v>

3340
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:29.580
<v Speaker 5>It's unwatchable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3341
02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just because we,</v>

3342
02:21:31.351 --> 02:21:31.790
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>W,</v>

3343
02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:33.330
<v Speaker 5>we weren't really paying attention to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3344
02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:35.210
<v Speaker 5>As people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

3345
02:21:35.211 --> 02:21:36.270

<v Speaker 5>We'll just hang out in the chat room or </v>

3347
02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:41.720
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And like read someone's tweets.</v>

3351
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:48.350

<v Speaker 4>I remember listening to an early one and</v>

3352
02:21:48.351 --> 02:21:53.351
<v Speaker 4>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was just a 32nd pause like you </v>

3355
02:21:58.020 --> 02:21:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3356
02:21:58.690 --> 02:22:03.690
<v Speaker 4>so everybody do like cats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shit moving around and no one's </v>

3357
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:06.560
<v Speaker 4>going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3358
02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is Kinda cool.</v>

3359
02:22:08.151 --> 02:22:10.510
<v Speaker 4>This is just a hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the</v>

3360
02:22:10.510 --> 02:22:13.120
<v Speaker 5>real evolution of the podcast is </v>
<v Speaker 5>available for everybody to say.</v>

3361
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:14.110
<v Speaker 5>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

3362
02:22:14.111 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3363
02:22:15.010 --> 02:22:17.200
<v Speaker 5>I always knew that I always wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>a radio show,</v>

3364
02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:19.300
<v Speaker 5>but I always knew that I would never be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to do a radio show.</v>

3365
02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:21.370
<v Speaker 5>Like no one would ever hire me to do a </v>
<v Speaker 5>radio show.</v>

3366
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:23.960
<v Speaker 5>And I thought maybe when satellite radio</v>
<v Speaker 5>came along I was,</v>

3367
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:27.330
<v Speaker 5>I became pals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like right when Santa Radio launch.</v>

3368
02:22:27.331 --> 02:22:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I became pals with opie and Anthony and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then always like,</v>

3369
02:22:29.331 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3370
02:22:29.701 --> 02:22:30.590
<v Speaker 5>we have a channel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3371
02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.890
<v Speaker 5>we'd always love to put you on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>channel,</v>

3372
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 5>but nothing ever really happened out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3373
02:22:33.751 --> 02:22:35.700
<v Speaker 5>And there was some talks and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever took pace.</v>

3374
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.980
<v Speaker 5>But then once I started doing a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3375
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.040
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like,</v>

3376
02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:41.850
<v Speaker 5>this is way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>

3377
02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:44.370
<v Speaker 5>And now I've got all these people coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

3378
02:22:44.371 --> 02:22:46.620
<v Speaker 5>like all these interesting people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these like,</v>

3379
02:22:46.621 --> 02:22:47.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

3380
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:50.160
<v Speaker 5>like bands like we to be real from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cypress Hill.</v>

3381
02:22:50.161 --> 02:22:52.130
<v Speaker 5>Yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3382
02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:54.420
<v Speaker 5>we've had everlast when the house of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Payne,</v>

3383
02:22:54.421 --> 02:22:57.570
<v Speaker 5>he's done it before and his band honey </v>
<v Speaker 5>honey is on next week.</v>

3384
02:22:57.571 --> 02:22:58.740
<v Speaker 5>And then Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3385
02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:01.950
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the neuroscientist who's the atheist,</v>

3386
02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:04.260
<v Speaker 5>a author and lecturer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's coming,</v>

3387
02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.320
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so excited about him coming on.</v>

3388
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:09.570
<v Speaker 5>But it's like we've been able to turn it</v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

3389
02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:12.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he was supposed to be,</v>

3390
02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:17.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just us fucking around to what I </v>

3391
02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:17.700
<v Speaker 5>really should have probably been doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the first place.</v>

3392
02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know what is it?</v>

3393
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:25.850
<v Speaker 4>It's Kinda like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were talking about before with </v>

3394
02:23:25.850 --> 02:23:28.351
<v Speaker 4>like the office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that or the man show the fact </v>

3395
02:23:28.351 --> 02:23:31.321
<v Speaker 4>that you're stepping into a preconceived</v>
<v Speaker 4>creative paradigm and trying to fill it </v>

3396
02:23:31.321 --> 02:23:35.671
<v Speaker 4>up is a failure to start with a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>that aspires to nothing.</v>

3397
02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:40.120
<v Speaker 4>And then organically it builds itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it knows what it is.</v>

3398
02:23:40.121 --> 02:23:44.530
<v Speaker 4>It's got a foundation based in who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really are as opposed to like,</v>

3399
02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:45.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3400
02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:47.440
<v Speaker 4>even as a comedian and he's starting </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

3401
02:23:47.441 --> 02:23:50.750
<v Speaker 4>you go through so many different masks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think I'm going to be the,</v>

3402
02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:53.080
<v Speaker 4>like I was going to be the clever guy or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3403
02:23:53.081 --> 02:23:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a political comic or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to use props.</v>

3404
02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:56.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go do it.</v>

3405
02:23:56.230 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Go do it until it doesn't work and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps shedding and then eventually </v>

3406
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.230
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be the comic you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant to be.</v>

3407
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:02.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think with the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same thing.</v>

3408
02:24:02.771 --> 02:24:07.771
<v Speaker 4>You kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you explore and you start to feel what </v>

3409
02:24:07.771 --> 02:24:11.281
<v Speaker 4>feels right and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hopefully not respond so much to </v>

3410
02:24:11.281 --> 02:24:11.281
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3411
02:24:11.281 --> 02:24:12.730
<v Speaker 4>people love this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to avoid that.</v>

3412
02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3413
02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:18.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people love what you love and if you </v>

3414
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:18.600
<v Speaker 5>pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you pursue what you love,</v>

3415
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:19.960
<v Speaker 5>then people connected that and they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate that.</v>

3416
02:24:19.961 --> 02:24:20.980
<v Speaker 5>I can appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3417
02:24:20.981 --> 02:24:25.981
<v Speaker 5>even if something that I'm not really </v>
<v Speaker 5>into what I love is someone else being </v>

3418
02:24:25.981 --> 02:24:29.011
<v Speaker 5>into something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love seeing people's passion and </v>

3419
02:24:29.011 --> 02:24:31.680
<v Speaker 5>honesty and what you get from a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get from anything else is </v>

3420
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:34.891
<v Speaker 5>there's no restrictions on time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to cut to a commercial </v>

3421
02:24:34.891 --> 02:24:38.930
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thoughts never have to be </v>

3422
02:24:38.930 --> 02:24:40.711
<v Speaker 5>interrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we didn't decide how long we're </v>

3423

<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

3539
02:29:29.701 --> 02:29:33.540
<v Speaker 5>So you're in this new place where </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone behaves super polite,</v>

3540
02:29:33.630 --> 02:29:36.150
<v Speaker 5>very orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when they had the tsunamis and they</v>

3541
02:29:36.151 --> 02:29:39.450
<v Speaker 5>were giving out aid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people just waited patiently,</v>

3542
02:29:39.451 --> 02:29:41.350
<v Speaker 5>politely disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3543
02:29:41.351 --> 02:29:42.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3544
02:29:42.331 --> 02:29:46.530
<v Speaker 5>the driver was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a really cool driver and he spoke</v>

3545
02:29:46.531 --> 02:29:47.430
<v Speaker 5>very good English two.</v>

3546
02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:50.340
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things he said was about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3547
02:29:50.530 --> 02:29:53.370
<v Speaker 5>the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the deal with Radiation Fukushima,</v>

3548
02:29:53.470 --> 02:29:56.340
<v Speaker 5>that a lot of people are sick and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>government lies about it.</v>

3549
02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:58.090
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3550
02:29:58.200 --> 02:30:00.600
<v Speaker 5>the problem is that we trust the </v>
<v Speaker 5>government,</v>

3551
02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:02.280
<v Speaker 5>the God we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

3552
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:05.370
<v Speaker 5>they're not in the rising up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>questioning the government.</v>

3553
02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:08.130
<v Speaker 5>People are into the trust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The government,</v>

3554
02:30:08.131 --> 02:30:13.131
<v Speaker 5>the government has their best interest </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they keep their eyes on their </v>

3555
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:13.131
<v Speaker 5>own business and they do what they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

3556
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:15.180
<v Speaker 5>So there's not a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this mother fucker go.</v>

3557
02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:16.980
<v Speaker 5>We tell him to take this motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3558
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.560
<v Speaker 5>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not there.</v>

3559
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:22.860
<v Speaker 5>It's politeness and not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not subservient.</v>

3560
02:30:22.861 --> 02:30:23.970
<v Speaker 5>See.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But knowing your place,</v>

3561
02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:26.030
<v Speaker 5>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>respect,</v>

3562
02:30:26.310 --> 02:30:28.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you never tried a community.</v>

3563
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:30.090
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't try to do better than your boss.</v>

3564
02:30:30.091 --> 02:30:31.670
<v Speaker 5>You don't try to do better in your box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3565
02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Callan was telling me that when you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's etiquette as far as businessmen </v>

3566
02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:39.330
<v Speaker 5>and like say if your boss orders a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain type of Scotch,</v>

3567
02:30:39.331 --> 02:30:41.610
<v Speaker 5>like a very expensive old scotch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't order that.</v>

3568
02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:44.460
<v Speaker 5>You order newer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheaper scotch and you order.</v>

3569
02:30:44.490 --> 02:30:45.570
<v Speaker 5>You don't order what he ordered.</v>

3570
02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:47.970
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And a bow is based on that.</v>

3571
02:30:47.971 --> 02:30:52.971
<v Speaker 7>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you bow lower to somebody who's </v>

3572
02:30:52.971 --> 02:30:52.971
<v Speaker 7>superior?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good question.</v>

3573
02:30:52.971 --> 02:30:53.340
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The lower you are,</v>

3574
02:30:53.341 --> 02:30:58.341
<v Speaker 7>the lower your bmi under that person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so like that's why you can get in a </v>

3575
02:30:58.341 --> 02:31:01.170
<v Speaker 7>fight with somebody if they think that </v>
<v Speaker 7>they are lower than you and that's where</v>

3576
02:31:01.171 --> 02:31:04.000
<v Speaker 7>it's like back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>rams on.</v>

3577
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:09.070
<v Speaker 7>You're sucking your own Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He knows what's up guys.</v>

3578
02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:12.460
<v Speaker 7>You know you're losing the bowel </v>
<v Speaker 7>contents when you sucking.</v>

3579
02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:17.500
<v Speaker 7>Don't pee pee or something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know you're underneath somebody when</v>

3580
02:31:18.861 --> 02:31:20.550
<v Speaker 7>you're looking at the guy behind you.</v>

3581
02:31:21.250 --> 02:31:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when one of the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 2>things about doing the road was like </v>

3582
02:31:26.250 --> 02:31:29.701
<v Speaker 2>working with black comics because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>black comics were supposed to be the </v>

3583
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Middle Act,</v>

<v Speaker 2>headliner.</v>

3585
02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:38.750
<v Speaker 2>If there was two other black acts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will always go up first I believe,</v>

3586

3696
02:36:08.631 --> 02:36:13.631
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just wonder what ever happened to the </v>

3697
02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:13.631
<v Speaker 6>gun?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rick Ducommun.</v>

3698
02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:13.631
<v Speaker 6>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3699
02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:14.880
<v Speaker 6>Rick Ducommun was fucking on him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3700
02:36:14.881 --> 02:36:16.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He had some good shit.</v>

3701
02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:17.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was.</v>

3702
02:36:18.030 --> 02:36:20.810
<v Speaker 6>It was always angry at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was a different kind of anger.</v>

3703
02:36:20.811 --> 02:36:22.700
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he leaves the microphone in the stand.</v>

3704
02:36:22.701 --> 02:36:25.610
<v Speaker 6>I remember that because like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all my guys like my favorite comics,</v>

3705
02:36:25.611 --> 02:36:29.840
<v Speaker 6>like prior kinison and George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they always carried the microphone,</v>

3706
02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:31.460
<v Speaker 6>but he would leave in the stand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3707
02:36:31.461 --> 02:36:33.170
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's angry with it in a stand.</v>

3708
02:36:33.171 --> 02:36:34.490
<v Speaker 6>This is a new approach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3709
02:36:34.491 --> 02:36:35.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a funny guy,</v>

3710
02:36:35.961 --> 02:36:37.010
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always wondered like,</v>

3711
02:36:37.011 --> 02:36:40.340
<v Speaker 6>there's always a few guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they were really funny at one point</v>

3712
02:36:40.341 --> 02:36:41.090
<v Speaker 6>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you're like,</v>

3713
02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:41.870
<v Speaker 6>where's that guy</v>

3714
02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:43.970
<v Speaker 7>will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>

3715
02:36:43.971 --> 02:36:48.971
<v Speaker 7>as cool as like Dana Gould,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to me it was like that when he was </v>

3716
02:36:48.971 --> 02:36:48.971
<v Speaker 7>young,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

3717
02:36:48.971 --> 02:36:48.971
<v Speaker 7>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's nobody funnier than this guy.</v>

3718
02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:51.360
<v Speaker 7>And then he went off to write for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>simpsons and you know,</v>

3719
02:36:51.390 --> 02:36:53.990
<v Speaker 7>cat casual friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm much better friends with him now,</v>

3720
02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:59.180
<v Speaker 7>didn't see him for years,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then all of a sudden he came back </v>

3721
02:36:59.180 --> 02:36:59.900
<v Speaker 7>with a vengeance and now he's like </v>
<v Speaker 7>phenomenal again,</v>

3722
02:36:59.901 --> 02:37:01.820
<v Speaker 7>but in a totally different way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I watched him,</v>

3723
02:37:01.821 --> 02:37:04.010
<v Speaker 7>one of his first sets back,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he still had it,</v>

3724
02:37:04.011 --> 02:37:09.011
<v Speaker 7>but it was weird watching the guy put </v>
<v Speaker 7>together a new app and they lacked and </v>

3725
02:37:09.011 --> 02:37:09.490
<v Speaker 7>though he clearly knew how to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>standup,</v>

3726
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:11.890
<v Speaker 7>but it was like you could see him doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>it going like,</v>

3727
02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:12.510
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is.</v>

3728
02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:14.330
<v Speaker 7>It was really kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3729
02:37:14.331 --> 02:37:14.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3730
02:37:14.721 --> 02:37:16.100
<v Speaker 7>it's like with Chris rock every</v>

3731
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:16.550
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3732
02:37:16.551 --> 02:37:18.470
<v Speaker 4>when he stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing about Chris Rock,</v>

3733
02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:21.500
<v Speaker 4>you got like Dave Chappelle who I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out of the womb,</v>

3734
02:37:21.501 --> 02:37:26.501
<v Speaker 4>grabbed the mic and was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you got Chris Rock who's a guy </v>

3735
02:37:26.501 --> 02:37:29.531
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've seen him when he </v>

3736
02:37:29.531 --> 02:37:29.531
<v Speaker 4>starts out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking painful.</v>

3737
02:37:29.531 --> 02:37:29.531
<v Speaker 4>He was</v>

3738
02:37:29.531 --> 02:37:33.860
<v Speaker 5>him getting ideas and not knowing where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going and trudge it out on stage</v>

3739
02:37:35.131 --> 02:37:36.270
<v Speaker 5>and not have it work at all.</v>

3740
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:37.230
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

3741
02:37:37.231 --> 02:37:40.850
<v Speaker 4>he's a guy who I think is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely funny,</v>

3742
02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.190
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I think he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>cerebral funny where he,</v>

3743
02:37:45.191 --> 02:37:46.940
<v Speaker 4>he thinks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he writes it,</v>

3744
02:37:46.941 --> 02:37:51.941
<v Speaker 4>he rewrites it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he works hard and then he comes up with </v>

3745
02:37:51.941 --> 02:37:51.941
<v Speaker 4>an hour like his is bigger and blacker </v>
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>

3746
02:37:51.941 --> 02:37:53.500
<v Speaker 4>Was that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3747
02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I'd put it against any hour of stand up </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

3748
02:37:56.430 --> 02:37:59.590
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the way people get there is a,</v>

3749
02:37:59.650 --> 02:38:00.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3750
02:38:00.291 --> 02:38:02.600
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking different for everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3751
02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:08.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think seeing somebody start to finish </v>

3752
02:38:08.050 --> 02:38:08.840
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to me is a great tv show.</v>

3753
02:38:08.841 --> 02:38:11.630
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see something on comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>central where you watch,</v>

3754
02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:16.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>for the remodel and watch them develop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3759
02:38:23.311 --> 02:38:24.660

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3760
02:38:24.661 --> 02:38:29.661
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is though that very few guys </v>

3761
02:38:29.661 --> 02:38:29.661
<v Speaker 5>actually put together an act like Louis </v>
<v Speaker 5>does every year.</v>

3762
02:38:29.790 --> 02:38:34.790
<v Speaker 5>Like to have people do it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you force comics to do it for a </v>

3763
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:35.070
<v Speaker 5>show that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the end of it,</v>

3764
02:38:35.071 --> 02:38:37.620
<v Speaker 5>you do a special and the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all do a half an hour.</v>

3765
02:38:37.621 --> 02:38:39.000
<v Speaker 5>It's an hour and a half specially if </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall.</v>

3766
02:38:39.001 --> 02:38:42.750
<v Speaker 5>Three comics over the course of a year </v>
<v Speaker 5>and over that or six months,</v>

3767
02:38:42.770 --> 02:38:44.640
<v Speaker 5>say six months for 30 minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>material.</v>

3768
02:38:44.641 --> 02:38:46.200
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's plenty of time.</v>

3769
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:47.520
<v Speaker 5>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3770
02:38:47.521 --> 02:38:52.521
<v Speaker 5>You know what really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could probably do it in three </v>

3771
02:38:52.521 --> 02:38:52.521
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>

3772
02:38:52.521 --> 02:38:52.930
<v Speaker 4>I think you got to do three because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be tough.</v>

3773
02:38:52.931 --> 02:38:54.640
<v Speaker 4>I get it right.</v>

3774
02:38:54.730 --> 02:38:55.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you could come,</v>

3775
02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could pace it out where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>come to them like once every couple </v>

3776
02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:02.120
<v Speaker 5>weeks or something to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3777
02:39:02.260 --> 02:39:04.780
<v Speaker 5>And I wonder if there's a three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You follow three,</v>

3778
02:39:04.781 --> 02:39:09.781
<v Speaker 5>but you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really follow six and use the best </v>

3779
02:39:09.781 --> 02:39:09.781
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

3780
02:39:09.781 --> 02:39:09.781
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3781
02:39:09.781 --> 02:39:13.171
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's a awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you front load it with like they </v>

3782
02:39:13.171 --> 02:39:16.471
<v Speaker 4>each have to get topics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sign if you want to make kind of a </v>

3783
02:39:16.471 --> 02:39:18.320
<v Speaker 4>reality show that paid off with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3784
02:39:18.430 --> 02:39:20.560
<v Speaker 4>this new 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3785
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:22.900
<v Speaker 4>just to keep it honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to start.</v>

3786
02:39:23.230 --> 02:39:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they all start with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same topics or they draw from a hat for </v>

3787
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.550
<v Speaker 4>topics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something to give it like,</v>

3788
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:33.750
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some like real last comic standing shit </v>

3789
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:36.931
<v Speaker 5>because you know what I didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>about last comic standing when they </v>

3790
02:39:36.931 --> 02:39:38.080
<v Speaker 5>forced those guys to start auditioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>in front of two judges,</v>

3791
02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:41.590
<v Speaker 5>do their act like what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not even stand up.</v>

3792
02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:43.990
<v Speaker 5>If you really want to watch them do </v>
<v Speaker 5>standup,</v>

02:39:43.991 --> 02:39:46.240
<v Speaker 5>go watch them do fucking stand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're making a guide.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Tell jokes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give him some dignity.</v>

3795
02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:49.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're trying to do this whole,</v>

3796
02:39:49.691 --> 02:39:50.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3797
02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:53.260
<v Speaker 5>what's his name from um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3798
02:39:53.410 --> 02:39:54.430
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the English,</v>

3799
02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:56.560
<v Speaker 5>the English guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>star search,</v>

3800
02:39:56.561 --> 02:39:57.390
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>

3801
02:39:57.430 --> 02:39:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simon.</v>

3802
02:39:58.571 --> 02:40:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Callow bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like trying to be like,</v>

3803
02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:05.350
<v Speaker 5>please enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That joke is never going to work.</v>

3804
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3805
02:40:05.971 --> 02:40:06.450
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3806
02:40:06.451 --> 02:40:08.820
<v Speaker 5>they're doing this like harsh judgment </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing because there's a lot.</v>

3807
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:10.690
<v Speaker 5>That's what a lot of people like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3808
02:40:10.691 --> 02:40:11.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the way to.</v>

3809
02:40:11.890 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 5>So I think the way to a standup show</v>

3810
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.660
<v Speaker 6>is not in front of a live audience like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3811
02:40:15.661 --> 02:40:18.330
<v Speaker 6>It's in front of a bunch of live on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fall guy around.</v>

3812
02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:19.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3813
02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:20.820
<v Speaker 6>Have a reality show where you've fallen </v>
<v Speaker 6>standups,</v>

3814
02:40:20.850 --> 02:40:22.500
<v Speaker 6>where they're putting together a </v>
<v Speaker 6>special.</v>

3815
02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:27.560
<v Speaker 6>And then at the end of the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they actually do their special monster </v>

3816
02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.120
<v Speaker 6>live event being at a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at a good size theater.</v>

3817
02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Only problem though is then the people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are going to know the material.</v>

3818
02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:36.230
<v Speaker 6>So really the best way to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to coordinate in advanced.</v>

3819
02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:36.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

3820
02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:41.860
<v Speaker 6>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You bank the whole thing and then you </v>

3821
02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:41.860
<v Speaker 6>roll it out later.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3822
02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:42.120
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't do it live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you could,</v>

3823
02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:47.180
<v Speaker 6>but you could do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you watch a live audience respond </v>

3824
02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:50.781
<v Speaker 6>to that material and you see how that </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys developed it and you'd really </v>

3825
02:40:50.781 --> 02:40:53.391
<v Speaker 6>appreciate it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a person who enjoys the craft of </v>

3826
02:40:53.391 --> 02:40:53.391
<v Speaker 6>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3827
02:40:53.391 --> 02:40:53.391
<v Speaker 6>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Write it up.</v>

3828
02:40:53.391 --> 02:40:54.510
<v Speaker 6>Let's write it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to pitch it,</v>

3829
02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:55.230
<v Speaker 6>what we call it.</v>

3830
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:56.240
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

3831
02:40:58.580 --> 02:41:01.600
<v Speaker 6>common upcoming can comma,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Q,</v>

3832
02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:02.450
<v Speaker 6>how?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kent area.</v>

3833
02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:08.560
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think we call it a from scratch comic</v>

3834
02:41:11.170 --> 02:41:12.530
<v Speaker 6>from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

3835
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:17.550
<v Speaker 6>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like that because that's essentially </v>

3836
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:17.550
<v Speaker 6>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he picked.</v>

3837
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:19.730
<v Speaker 6>People have really different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Comedy from scratch.</v>

3838
02:41:19.731 --> 02:41:20.720
<v Speaker 6>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You nailed it.</v>

3839
02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:22.480
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the name you get.</v>

3840
02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:25.630
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe you get the same five topics.</v>

3841
02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:27.440
<v Speaker 6>You're gonna do 15 minutes on five </v>
<v Speaker 6>topics.</v>

3842
02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:32.560
<v Speaker 6>Then you get a guy who's a storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get a guy who's a setup punchline </v>

3843
02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:32.560
<v Speaker 6>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You get.</v>

3844
02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:33.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you were.</v>

3845
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:34.970
<v Speaker 6>We're limiting ourselves that we give </v>
<v Speaker 6>them topics.</v>

3846
02:41:34.971 --> 02:41:37.850
<v Speaker 6>If you just let the guy explore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you get to see where he's coming up</v>

3847
02:41:37.851 --> 02:41:42.851
<v Speaker 6>with his material,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't know if he didn't already </v>

3848
02:41:42.851 --> 02:41:42.851
<v Speaker 6>write it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make sure they're.</v>

3849
02:41:42.851 --> 02:41:43.370
<v Speaker 6>They're not pulling some old shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

3850
02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.440
<v Speaker 6>Plus it'd be all come jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

3851
02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:46.580
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

3852
02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:48.860
<v Speaker 6>We know when you disqualify them from </v>
<v Speaker 6>the show,</v>

3853
02:41:48.861 --> 02:41:50.060
<v Speaker 6>if they do say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen man,</v>

3854
02:41:50.061 --> 02:41:51.140
<v Speaker 6>you can't lie about this.</v>

3855
02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:52.940
<v Speaker 6>If we find out you're lying about this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fucked.</v>

3856
02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:54.310
<v Speaker 6>We want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3857
02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:59.340
<v Speaker 6>we want all new material.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still feel like it needs a starting </v>

3858
02:41:59.451 --> 02:42:01.240
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It needs like a crisp,</v>

3859
02:42:01.241 --> 02:42:01.920
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 6>how about this?</v>

3861
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:06.110
<v Speaker 6>Maybe there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's three comics,</v>

3862
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:09.200
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want them to have five new topics.</v>

3863

<v Speaker 6>Each one has five new top,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but assign them five topics that may </v>

3864
02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:17.241
<v Speaker 6>come up with material,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they have like a fucking big wheel </v>

3865
02:42:17.241 --> 02:42:17.241
<v Speaker 6>and they have to reach in and pull the </v>
<v Speaker 6>topics out.</v>

3866
02:42:17.241 --> 02:42:17.840
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's good.</v>

3867

3899
02:43:47.701 --> 02:43:51.700
<v Speaker 6>the new Prius where it takes all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>electrical shit out and it's just a fast</v>

3900
02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:56.880
<v Speaker 6>light little Toyota and you go really </v>
<v Speaker 6>fast and you get no gas mileage and </v>

3901
02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.991
<v Speaker 6>that's how I drive all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did a thing on top gear where they </v>

3902
02:44:00.991 --> 02:44:04.621
<v Speaker 6>had a prius and an m three and they sent</v>
<v Speaker 6>them around a race track and the </v>

3903
02:44:04.621 --> 02:44:07.300
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] actually ate less gas than </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Prius did when it was driving around</v>

3904
02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:08.740
<v Speaker 6>meant for around town.</v>

3905
02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:11.220
<v Speaker 6>That's where you save the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now when I'm dropping,</v>

<v Speaker 2>me off that you want me to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3998
02:47:44.370 --> 02:47:47.480
<v Speaker 2>this is confusing as fuck and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to develop any taste for this.</v>

3999
02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:49.380
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

4000
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:54.670
<v Speaker 7>That's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because you've been socialized to not </v>

4001
02:47:54.670 --> 02:47:55.080
<v Speaker 7>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's unsocialized in you and that's.</v>

4002
02:47:55.130 --> 02:47:57.380
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 7>May Not be limited to her pool.</v>

4003
02:47:57.381 --> 02:47:58.070
<v Speaker 7>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>

4004
02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:01.260
<v Speaker 2>took a while to get this out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we first started dating,</v>

4005
02:48:01.261 --> 02:48:03.470
<v Speaker 2>she was like super normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it came.</v>

4006
02:48:03.570 --> 02:48:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

4007
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:07.920
<v Speaker 2>it took some time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to like what she really liked.</v>

4008
02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:13.580
<v Speaker 2>It was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like as she got a little bit more </v>

4009
02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:13.580
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would like want to arm wrestle me or</v>

4010
02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:17.490
<v Speaker 2>something and it was real weird and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of a couple of months,</v>

4011
02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:20.280
<v Speaker 2>that next thing pretty quickly I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking thrown around.</v>

4012
02:48:20.281 --> 02:48:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Dude was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like hoist her up in the air and</v>

4013
02:48:24.031 --> 02:48:25.590
<v Speaker 2>like toss her through the air and shit</v>

4014
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:27.620
<v Speaker 7>the best is you meet a guy later and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

4015
02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:30.110
<v Speaker 7>oh you stay Jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was dating Jennifer and just look at.</v>

4016
02:48:30.111 --> 02:48:31.870
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

4017
02:48:31.871 --> 02:48:35.120
<v Speaker 7>you just shake your head and walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't Jennifer just,</v>

4018
02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:36.500
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't mean to say Jennifer.</v>

4019
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:39.590
<v Speaker 7>She was a nice girl.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now she was great,</v>

4020
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:41.480
<v Speaker 7>but I had a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did a.</v>

4021
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:42.830
<v Speaker 7>When I was at the neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 7>playhouse,</v>

4022
02:48:42.831 --> 02:48:45.830
<v Speaker 7>we had a scene from Farrah Fawcett did </v>
<v Speaker 7>this movie,</v>

4023
02:48:45.831 --> 02:48:48.470
<v Speaker 7>I forget what it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but she gets raped.</v>

4024
02:48:48.490 --> 02:48:49.640
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the burning.</v>

4025
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:50.660
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

4026
02:48:50.661 --> 02:48:55.661
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we're doing the rape scene from that </v>

4027
02:48:55.661 --> 02:48:55.661
<v Speaker 7>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we get a that and I'm like fuck.</v>

4028
02:48:55.661 --> 02:48:58.190
<v Speaker 7>And this girl is like not a great face </v>
<v Speaker 7>but giant rag,</v>

4029
02:48:58.191 --> 02:49:03.191
<v Speaker 7>good body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so we have to rehearse it and so we </v>

4030
02:49:03.191 --> 02:49:06.821
<v Speaker 7>go to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get to go to the workspace and </v>

4031
02:49:06.821 --> 02:49:08.340
<v Speaker 7>there's a combination lock and we go in </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's just us and we're practicing</v>

4032
02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:11.520
<v Speaker 4>the rape scene where I literally knock </v>
<v Speaker 4>her down,</v>

4033
02:49:11.521 --> 02:49:16.521
<v Speaker 4>get on top of her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rip her blouse on Jesus and I'm a kind </v>

4034
02:49:16.521 --> 02:49:20.100
<v Speaker 4>of dry humping her while she screams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we start to rehearse it in.</v>

4035
02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:23.370
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we have to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>studio alone is we try to do it in class</v>

4036
02:49:23.371 --> 02:49:26.670
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is completely not believable.</v>

4037
02:49:26.671 --> 02:49:30.000
<v Speaker 4>You guys are so aware and you're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibited,</v>

4038
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:32.850
<v Speaker 4>you need to let this scene out together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come do it.</v>

4039
02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:38.250
<v Speaker 4>So we go to the studio and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I get on top of her and I ripped her</v>

4040
02:49:38.251 --> 02:49:39.090
<v Speaker 4>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

4041
02:49:39.091 --> 02:49:40.260
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought an extra shirt.</v>

4042
02:49:40.261 --> 02:49:45.261
<v Speaker 4>You can just just rip it and I rip it </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant rack and I start and I'm and I'm </v>

4043
02:49:45.261 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 4>dry humping and we're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the lines and,</v>

4044
02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:52.400
<v Speaker 4>and we just start like dry humping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dry humping and I keep and I was so </v>

4045
02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:52.400
<v Speaker 4>embarrassed that I kept stopping.</v>

4046
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:57.000
<v Speaker 4>I raging art on and I'm rubbing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>against you could redo the scene and she</v>

4047
02:49:57.001 --> 02:50:00.870
<v Speaker 4>was totally into it and I was totally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally sexually oh,</v>

4048
02:50:00.871 --> 02:50:05.871
<v Speaker 4>it was such a turnout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was both totally into it and she was </v>

4049
02:50:06.391 --> 02:50:10.140
<v Speaker 4>dating a guy in the class so I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go over that line,</v>

4050
02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:15.530
<v Speaker 4>but I had to get in the head as an actor</v>
<v Speaker 4>of being a rapist and I just couldn't do</v>

4051
02:50:16.051 --> 02:50:21.051
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't give over to really feeling </v>

4052
02:50:21.051 --> 02:50:23.010
<v Speaker 4>what it would feel it because to really </v>
<v Speaker 4>tap into what it would feel like to rape</v>

4053
02:50:23.011 --> 02:50:28.011
<v Speaker 4>somebody and want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it would require me shedding so </v>

4054
02:50:28.011 --> 02:50:29.130
<v Speaker 4>many constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

4055
02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:32.550
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know how you could really </v>
<v Speaker 4>portray a rapist.</v>

4056
02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I felt like apologizing the whole time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was doing it.</v>

4057
02:50:35.930 --> 02:50:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird to put your mind into </v>

4058
02:50:40.930 --> 02:50:41.590
<v Speaker 2>that place and then to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To trust it to not actually.</v>

4059
02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>

4060
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:47.390
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know when the breaks we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go on if I let that.</v>

4061
02:50:47.450 --> 02:50:50.780
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid that if I let it out I </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't stop because it's an every man.</v>

4062
02:50:51.210 --> 02:50:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Every man has some chimpanzee inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and chimps are just raping each </v>

4063
02:50:56.210 --> 02:50:56.210
<v Speaker 2>other left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4064
02:50:56.210 --> 02:50:56.700
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

4065
02:50:56.760 --> 02:50:58.560
<v Speaker 2>They love to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get some pussy.</v>

4066
02:50:58.561 --> 02:50:59.220
<v Speaker 2>You gotta take it.</v>

4067
02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4068
02:51:00.361 --> 02:51:01.710
<v Speaker 4>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in America,</v>

4069
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I think we've gotten away from that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4070
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:08.400
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were playing pool that I totally</v>

4071
02:51:08.401 --> 02:51:11.100
<v Speaker 2>agree with is that people aren't afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting punched in the face anymore.</v>

4072
02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:12.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's a problem.</v>

4073
02:51:12.530 --> 02:51:13.730
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4074
02:51:13.731 --> 02:51:16.130
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've lost biologically and your act,</v>

4075
02:51:16.131 --> 02:51:16.790
<v Speaker 4>I know it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4076
02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:21.800
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you play a lot with the idea of the </v>

4077
02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:23.000
<v Speaker 4>animal kingdom and how as humans we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to stop denying the connection.</v>

4078
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're a species and,</v>

4079
02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:28.850
<v Speaker 4>and we developed as a species by getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>punched in the face and being killed for</v>

4080
02:51:28.851 --> 02:51:33.851
<v Speaker 4>doing this action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the other people survived and </v>

4081
02:51:33.851 --> 02:51:33.851
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do that action and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what shaped us.</v>

4082
02:51:33.851 --> 02:51:35.840
<v Speaker 4>And it's also like when I see a guy on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

4083
02:51:35.860 --> 02:51:40.860
<v Speaker 4>like there was a guy in his convertible </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day and he was talking on his </v>

4084
02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Bluetooth phone and I forget what he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

4085
02:51:41.211 --> 02:51:46.211
<v Speaker 4>but just being allowed for self-involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>Douche who didn't look around and </v>

4086
02:51:46.211 --> 02:51:50.171
<v Speaker 4>everyone could hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just thought I want to punch this </v>

4087
02:51:50.171 --> 02:51:52.991
<v Speaker 4>guy in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when I should and I should </v>

4088
02:51:52.991 --> 02:51:55.301
<v Speaker 4>because I'm doing society a disservice </v>
<v Speaker 4>by not punching him in the face and if </v>

4089
02:51:55.301 --> 02:51:55.301
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

4090
02:51:55.301 --> 02:51:58.660
<v Speaker 2>What is it about someone that's talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>loud with a convertible and a bluetooth?</v>

4091
02:51:58.661 --> 02:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>It's so offensive</v>

4092
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:03.270
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a society that is supposed to</v>

4093
02:52:03.271 --> 02:52:08.271
<v Speaker 4>be aware of its other members and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>working towards a certain set of beliefs</v>

4094
02:52:09.790 --> 02:52:14.790
<v Speaker 4>like I'm respecting each other's space </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not being a flashy car,</v>

4095
02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:21.030
<v Speaker 4>so don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't like he wanted attention </v>

4096
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:23.320
<v Speaker 4>to social bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not giving me the credit of being</v>

4097
02:52:23.321 --> 02:52:26.230
<v Speaker 4>a pedestrian who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who doesn't want to hear you,</v>

4098
02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:27.310
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4099
02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:30.220
<v Speaker 4>you're not even looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're making me feel like I don't exist</v>

4100
02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:35.400
<v Speaker 4>and you're making me feel like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about is more important </v>

4101
02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:35.400
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know that sounds weird,</v>

4102
02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:36.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a subconscious thing where you feel</v>

4103
02:52:36.821 --> 02:52:40.000
<v Speaker 4>like you're not validating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the fact that I'm a pedestrian.</v>

4104
02:52:40.001 --> 02:52:40.270
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4105
02:52:40.271 --> 02:52:40.410
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4106
02:52:40.530 --> 02:52:42.150
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not necessarily right.</v>

4107
02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:43.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

4108
02:52:43.541 --> 02:52:47.060
<v Speaker 2>if you do have your fucking car and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you answer a phone call,</v>

4109
02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:47.580
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4110
02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my top down right now and I'm </v>

4111
02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:52.740
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

4112
02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:53.550
<v Speaker 4>Let me put the top on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll call you right back.</v>

4113
02:52:53.551 --> 02:52:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4114
02:52:54.570 --> 02:52:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I would never talk to somebody in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant or coffee shop.</v>

4115
02:52:58.250 --> 02:52:58.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4116
02:52:58.651 --> 02:53:01.140
<v Speaker 4>there's just things I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't talk to someone on the phone.</v>

4117
02:53:01.141 --> 02:53:06.141
<v Speaker 4>You mean I go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really always text when you're at a </v>

4118
02:53:06.721 --> 02:53:11.721
<v Speaker 4>dinner or a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only when somebody like goes to the </v>

4119
02:53:11.721 --> 02:53:11.721
<v Speaker 4>bathroom or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4120
02:53:11.721 --> 02:53:13.680
<v Speaker 4>like I don't check texts that often </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like there's like,</v>

4121
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:18.830
<v Speaker 4>I feel like life has a rhythm that we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost and if I'm constantly available </v>

4122
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:23.450
<v Speaker 4>then I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My rhythm is thrown off because it's </v>

4123
02:53:23.450 --> 02:53:24.510
<v Speaker 4>something can happen in that text that </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes my thought too.</v>

4124
02:53:24.511 --> 02:53:29.511
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta call that guy back or I get to </v>

4125
02:53:29.511 --> 02:53:31.031
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suddenly become a servant of my </v>

4126
02:53:31.031 --> 02:53:33.801
<v Speaker 4>messages coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I try to space it out every two or </v>

4127
02:53:33.801 --> 02:53:36.621
<v Speaker 4>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything that </v>

4128
02:53:36.621 --> 02:53:36.621
<v Speaker 4>important that I can't ignore.</v>

4129
02:53:36.621 --> 02:53:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm very addicted to a technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological communication,</v>

4130
02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>whether it's twitter or texting or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard for me if my phone's in </v>

4131
02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:47.310
<v Speaker 2>my pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I it vibrates.</v>

4132
02:53:47.311 --> 02:53:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I know I got a text.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost have to read it.</v>

4133
02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Are you a multitasker though?</v>

4134
02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:56.880
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're having a </v>

4135
02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:56.880
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

4136
02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:57.430
<v Speaker 2>You really shouldn't be texting people </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a restaurant.</v>

4137
02:53:57.790 --> 02:54:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I avoid it whenever possible.</v>

4138
02:54:00.250 --> 02:54:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll excuse myself and go to the </v>

4139
02:54:05.250 --> 02:54:05.390
<v Speaker 4>bathroom and then check my emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never do it at the table.</v>

4140
02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:09.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting thing because we.</v>

4141
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:13.460
<v Speaker 2>We do have this weird disconnect when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're right in front of each other,</v>

4142
02:54:13.610 --> 02:54:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like this is the ultimate is to be right</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of a person and communicate </v>

4143
02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:21.611
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile you're sitting there </v>

4144
02:54:21.611 --> 02:54:23.800
<v Speaker 2>exchanging text words with someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near you while there's a person </v>

4145
02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:25.180
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you and they feel less</v>
<v Speaker 2>important now,</v>

4146
02:54:25.250 --> 02:54:29.570
<v Speaker 2>unless it's something like fucking super</v>
<v Speaker 2>important and really what is really what</v>

4147
02:54:29.571 --> 02:54:31.970
<v Speaker 2>is what is while you're having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

4148
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:34.750
<v Speaker 4>you get three calls a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really are like,</v>

4149
02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:39.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta call back for this thing </v>

4150
02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:40.000
<v Speaker 4>that's coming tomorrow or your wife has </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken the kid to the hospital</v>

4151
02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:43.180
<v Speaker 2>and I love the fact about the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I look at my phone,</v>

4152
02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I get the message right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even have to read,</v>

4153
02:54:45.971 --> 02:54:47.740
<v Speaker 2>so I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Help call me right now.</v>

4154
02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:48.430

4162
