00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>like if we all men and women,</v>

149
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.373
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

150
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And this is coming from a guy who has kids and loves having kids.</v>

151
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

152
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a weirdness to having sex with men and women because it can possibly</v>

153
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>result in a child.</v>

154
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>That weirdness is eliminated with gay people.</v>

155
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking,</v>

156
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>and there's no Yang.</v>

157
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all Yin or Yang.</v>

158
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>No Yen,</v>

159
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>

160
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>whichever it is a hard one.</v>

161
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

162
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>there is a bit of a Yemeni,</v>

164
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

165
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of that as a bottom top issue,</v>

166
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

167
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's what the issue isn't what a man wants versus what a woman wants.</v>

168
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>They're both men.</v>

169
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>So the weirdness like the trying to figure out women,</v>

170
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>especially like when you're young,</v>

171
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest things is just the idea of trying to think the way a woman</v>

172
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>things you think the way a guy thinks,</v>

173
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>you think everything's going to be fine.</v>

174
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And like I remember when I was young and I just started dating when I was like a</v>

175
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>

176
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I would talk to girls the way I would talk to my friends and they would get</v>

177
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 1>upset and they would think you're crazy and can't do it.</v>

178
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>You cannot change your language completely.</v>

179
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Change your language,</v>

180
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>change your approach,</v>

181
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>change the way you guys can fuck around with each other and we assume that we're</v>

182
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>gonna like laugh and fuck around with each other back.</v>

183
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.061
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we did.</v>

184
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>We insult each other halfass constantly.</v>

185
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that Irish fucking vengeance thing,</v>

186
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

187
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

188
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:02.591
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

189
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>well if I did when I was young,</v>

190
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I eliminated it at all with thinking.</v>

191
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know that I've argued.</v>

192
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you argue with people in your head?</v>

193
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't allow myself to do an immune that anymore.</v>

194
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.613
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that.</v>

195
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I used to do that when I was a young man.</v>

196
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.803
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

197
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>if I was a young man,</v>

198
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:21.341
<v Speaker 1>I've got an argument,</v>

199
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

200
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I would relive that argument like every day for like 10 minutes for like a year.</v>

201
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll come back to it a year later.</v>

202
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking God,</v>

203
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I should have told that.</v>

204
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.083
<v Speaker 1>Fuck God.</v>

205
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you mister.</v>

206
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to like go through your notes.</v>

207
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Like what was I gonna say to him?</v>

208
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.681
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

209
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that I used to talk about this on stage.</v>

210
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:38.684
<v Speaker 1>This is totally true.</v>

211
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>When I was a,</v>

212
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was like 26,</v>

213
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.681
<v Speaker 1>I live,</v>

214
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Encino and I rented this house and it had an orange tree in the</v>

215
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>front yard and I didn't pay my bills.</v>

216
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very irresponsible.</v>

217
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So this guy came over,</v>

218
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

219
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I turned the power back on and the guy came over to turn the power on and it</v>

220
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>seemed like a nice guy said,</v>

221
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

222

267
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:04.390
<v Speaker 1>so he's talking about he was directing the movie staying alive.</v>

268
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

269
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

270
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

272
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.031
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

273
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>and it was a Travolta movie that,</v>

274
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>that Frank Stallone's sang on the soundtrack.</v>

275
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:11.644
<v Speaker 1>That is correct.</v>

276
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

277
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.220
<v Speaker 1>so yes.</v>

278
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So Stallone said that he,</v>

279
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.734
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

280
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.331
<v Speaker 1>he goes.</v>

281
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:20.020
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

282
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I called John Up to the house for a meeting about that song,</v>

283
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>play that song while the story is going,</v>

284
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>he goes alone.</v>

285
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.240
<v Speaker 1>This is the end.</v>

286
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.931
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called,</v>

287
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.200
<v Speaker 1>this is the end and staying alive soundtrack.</v>

288
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

289
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.431
<v Speaker 1>he goes.</v>

290
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>So John came up and he goes,</v>

291
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>John's got a real food issue that people don't know.</v>

292
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.363

<v Speaker 1>he's hanging on to some shit from the early eighties right?</v>

317
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.100
<v Speaker 1>One was staying alive.</v>

318
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 1>That was 82.</v>

319
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he's walking down the streets in New York City with a fucking fur</v>

320
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>coat on and it got bumps into him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Travolta bumps in on like Stallone,</v>

336
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.620
<v Speaker 3>This is frank.</v>

337
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Stallone's stuff still owns brother.</v>

338
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.230
<v Speaker 3>This fucking song was the shit back in the day.</v>

339
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.730
<v Speaker 3>I wish I knew how to dance song.</v>

340
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm downloading this,</v>

341
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.150
<v Speaker 3>not even fucking around and say,</v>

342
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about this.</v>

343
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew how to dance back then.</v>

344
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be a part of this world.</v>

345
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be the impressive guy on the dance floor are spinning around and in</v>

346
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>a perfect position.</v>

347
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's still only said that they were shooting flashdance next door and he's like,</v>

348
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>and we knew that that was going to be the one John Travolta met a single</v>

349
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:13.651
<v Speaker 1>handedly,</v>

350
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>made more men gay just from this music and from singing and dancing and getting</v>

351
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.344
<v Speaker 1>people to dance.</v>

352
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.500
<v Speaker 1>He probably purse.</v>

353
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>That was probably his total overall goal,</v>

354
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>which is to say nothing of his bath house work just or the Shah's power work,</v>

355
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but just to be able to dance so good and make dancing fucking dancing.</v>

356
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not the Fred Astaire days.</v>

357
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.960
<v Speaker 1>This is a new era of manliness we get from you.</v>

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.791
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

443
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that to another testament to the,</v>

444
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.180
<v Speaker 1>to the gays are having a blast.</v>

445
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

446
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>They're having more fun for sure.</v>

447
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Sure works by kind of having a blast.</v>

448
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:41.551
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

449
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:42.610
<v Speaker 1>The gays are not having fun.</v>

450
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.860
<v Speaker 1>The ones who fuck up and adopt kids,</v>

451
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.731
<v Speaker 1>they start thinking,</v>

452
00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like a family.</v>

453
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:47.800
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get there.</v>

454
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.401
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get married.</v>

455
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:49.021
<v Speaker 1>We'd adopt kids.</v>

456
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:49.854
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

457
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.940
<v Speaker 1>what does a lot of fucking work?</v>

458
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You realize they had the key.</v>

459
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

460
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>they're winning the race and nobody had the baby out of their body.</v>

461
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.391
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of them.</v>

462
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>So they're both standing there with this little motherfucker.</v>

463
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It's causing all sorts of problems.</v>

464
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:03.761
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

465
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up the whole big gay party.</v>

466
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Is this another gate?</v>

467
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here?</v>

468
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.170

470
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>she's acting.</v>

471
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.180
<v Speaker 1>She's talking about her baby.</v>

472
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how you were just saying the Dixon mouth.</v>

473
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 1>This is a news reporter saying how she used to take her a electric toothbrush</v>

474
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>and to help her kids gums,</v>

475
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 1>but she did it on air and it just completely</v>

476
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>keep the music plan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

484
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>It's funny that you're not supposed to ever think of those people being sexual.</v>

486
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Like if she actually did do that and start it with like,</v>

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the fun,</v>

492
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:57.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the fun parts about having sex with women is how different it is from</v>

493
00:12:57.771 --> 00:12:58.940
<v Speaker 1>what they're normally like.</v>

494
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause you and I are eight or 10 seconds.</v>

495
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine you fucking within eight seconds of right now someone wants to</v>

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.773
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>

500
00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:14.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

501
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and then the difference between like a girl and real life and a girl getting</v>

502
00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:22.331
<v Speaker 1>fucked or fucking is so fast and it's so awesome and so exciting.</v>

514
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you to think about a guy sucking a guy's Dick and I'm gonna get</v>

515
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:49.131
<v Speaker 1>you to watch it.</v>

516
00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>

517
00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about me having sex,</v>

518
00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:52.730
<v Speaker 1>so I see what you both have done.</v>

519
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.553
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>

520
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.451
<v Speaker 1>How dare bolt.</v>

521
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Some comic was telling me that when he'd go on the road,</v>

522
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.760
<v Speaker 1>him and his buddies who were staying at the hotel together,</v>

523
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.630
<v Speaker 1>they knew that they were going to try to bring girls back to the hotel room</v>

524
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:06.464
<v Speaker 1>afterward.</v>

525
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

526
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and they wanted the girls to not be wearing a lot of close,</v>

527
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 1>so they would turn the heat up as high as they could and the hotel.</v>

528
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.690
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

529
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.830
<v Speaker 1>How dumb does that all make?</v>

530
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Girls are in a hotel room.</v>

531
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.290
<v Speaker 1>They'll get Nicky.</v>

532
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I know we're fucking,</v>

533
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:23.810
<v Speaker 1>because you know how that goes.</v>

534
00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

535
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.580
<v Speaker 1>When people get really hot and lethargic,</v>

536
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>that's when they're the best investment they want.</v>

537
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>It can't stop thinking about when you're about to dehydrate you about the</v>

538
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.220
<v Speaker 1>blackout,</v>

539
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.780
<v Speaker 1>that's when you really want to throw down.</v>

540
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

541
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Just to bring a lot of water.</v>

542
00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Give them water and they'll fuck you.</v>

543
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Are you add and Ami right now?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Checking on right there.</v>

545
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.330
<v Speaker 1>I want to check in saying that's what I'm saying.</v>

546
00:14:44.331 --> 00:14:44.901
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

547
00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Put that fucking phone man.</v>

548
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.023
<v Speaker 1>You can interrupt.</v>

549
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:47.751
<v Speaker 1>Donate it.</v>

550
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Speaker 1>The flow of the conversation is interrupted.</v>

551
00:14:49.401 --> 00:14:50.760
<v Speaker 1>If you left those fucks in your mind.</v>

552
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.531
<v Speaker 1>Thought you were.</v>

553
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the flow.</v>

554
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>I felt like you were putting a dam up a damn.</v>

555
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were fucking beavering.</v>

556
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to think about you fucking or I don't want this one did walk.</v>

557
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>The work flow was going,</v>

558
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.400

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.450

561
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 1>It was there already going there.</v>

562
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:08.444
<v Speaker 1>It was already there.</v>

563
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.473
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

564
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.700

565
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

566
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
