00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night,</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.963
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

4
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Guy Mma in combat sports.</v>

5
00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 2>The means the use of social media total.</v>

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.911
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>

7
00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 2>So cool man.</v>

8
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're,</v>

9
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 2>unless you're Ronda Rousey's Nunez fight are</v>

10
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 2>so many fucking people.</v>

11
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what those mean?</v>

12
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you think she's coming back?</v>

13
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:24.371
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

14
00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:25.204
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she is.</v>

15
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think,</v>

16
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

17
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 2>well if she does,</v>

18
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>she should come back in a calculated manner.</v>

19
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Like don't just rush in and fight for the title like she did.</v>

20
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I think that's crazy.</v>

21
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.081
<v Speaker 2>Taking a year off,</v>

22
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 2>getting head kick,</v>

23
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:39.754
<v Speaker 2>knocked out,</v>

24
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.271
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

25
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.104
<v Speaker 2>Where's your head out?</v>

26
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And was she 100% committed to this as far as like training for the entire time</v>

27
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>off or did she just get in really good shape over the last few months and had</v>

28
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 2>she been training at all before then?</v>

29
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

30
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to ask her and answer all those questions,</v>

31
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 2>but if she doesn't want to be fighting,</v>

32
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 2>she shouldn't be fighting,</v>

33
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

34
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>But you don't shouting from the beginning.</v>

35
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>He had movement head movement,</v>

36
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>so I assumed they worked on the hip movement.</v>

37
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I just think depression,</v>

38
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>the way she comes to the angry face and all that shuts her down and,</v>

39
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's too much pressure.</v>

40
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>A whole Hollywood career writes on it.</v>

41
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not going to happen now.</v>

42
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

43
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.111
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

44
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean because buddy the road too,</v>

45
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>we talked about no footwork.</v>

46
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.823
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>but that's what nurses can do to you.</v>

48
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

49
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I like to see a Rhonda with a smile on her face.</v>

50
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:25.864
<v Speaker 1>Go to the ring,</v>

51
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>being relaxed and calm,</v>

52
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>send her away,</v>

53
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and have some smokers because you can still</v>

54
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>legally do that.</v>

55
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And other clubs just striking,</v>

56
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>she's just get in that moment that to see where your wet.</v>

58
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I think in training,</v>

59
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem that everybody has.</v>

60
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>in training you always do good.</v>

62
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys do good.</v>

63
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>But you know as well as I do,</v>

64
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>there's these gym guys are really good in training.</v>

65
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>They can do it on a pressure.</v>

66
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So if she's been boxing and working on a striking and she's been hitting people</v>

67
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:52.121
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

68
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:52.511
<v Speaker 1>they're right there.</v>

69
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>They got some good people coming in.</v>

70
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:54.311
<v Speaker 1>I heard that she,</v>

71
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 1>that works out to eva with Exa boxing champions or jammies and doing well</v>

72
00:01:59.141 --> 00:01:59.974
<v Speaker 1>against them.</v>

73
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

74
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's a nice safe environment,</v>

75
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 1>bringing it under pressure with all the crap she had on her shoulders.</v>

76
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 2>The is also a notation of the way Nunez is a very dangerous punch sought in</v>

77
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Strikeforce men right away,</v>

78
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 2>right away her kicks or punches.</v>

79
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 2>She kicks and punches so fucking hard and she has long arms and she puts you on</v>

80
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>the end of these long punches and cheat.</v>

81
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Dinged Rhonda very early in the fight and you could tell she was rock.</v>

82
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>She goes right back into the home fight.</v>

83
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

84
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Thank habitat and noon is also leans all the way over.</v>

85
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to take her down,</v>

86
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>and run the show you,</v>

88
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll show,</v>

89
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.181
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's doing it.</v>

91
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying what I don't see,</v>

92
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:39.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe start wrestling over as well tell because a girl like that with so much</v>

94
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>

95
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>she'll pick that up so fast.</v>

96
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>But if she suddenly shoots for a singer or,</v>

97
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

98
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 2>you'd already been rocked.</v>

99
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 2>So I think that because remember she shucked her off early clenches always upper</v>

100
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 2>body couch and she always reaches him with the left arm.</v>

101
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 2>You know Greg Jackson,</v>

102
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I talked about it after the Holm fight that day had seen every single one of her</v>

103
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

104
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>She comes at you,</v>

105
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>she grew up that left arm extended,</v>

106
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 2>tries to get ahold of girls with the left arm,</v>

107
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.061
<v Speaker 2>hip tosses them,</v>

108
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:07.841
<v Speaker 2>gets them on the ground,</v>

109
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>armbars him and they just were so prepared.</v>

110
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.000
<v Speaker 2>What is it that was going to say?</v>

111
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Interesting that whole shift from MMA,</v>

112
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>from boxing demo may just trained for Ronda Rousey fight.</v>

113
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Cordy car brand members says a kickbox kickboxing and boxing champ.</v>

114
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.440
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying in terms of her,</v>

115
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.091
<v Speaker 2>Emma May prep,</v>

116
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the goal was Ronda Rousey,</v>

117
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:23.981
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

118
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>And now with Cody Garbrandt he talked about in high school,</v>

119
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.611
<v Speaker 2>Dominick Cruz.</v>

120
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>And you think you wonder,</v>

121
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

122
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

123
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>the laser focus,</v>

124
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:30.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

125
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:30.851
<v Speaker 2>The television,</v>

126
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 2>obviously you have to work on everything,</v>

127
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 2>but if that's your target and you see what he did to cruise,</v>

128
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.251
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

129
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.084
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

130
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.271
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

131
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of fighters.</v>

132
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
