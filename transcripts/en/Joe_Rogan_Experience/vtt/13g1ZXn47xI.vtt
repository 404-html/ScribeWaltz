00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But another time I fought,</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:06.624
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I used to take the number one bus from Jersey City Rothberg into high school and</v>

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:15.891
<v Speaker 1>we were on the bus one morning kids and there was a guy reading a paper and he</v>

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 1>had a connector of drool from his Lyft to the daily news and there was a puddle,</v>

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>he was on heroin.</v>

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>They would go to Jersey City in those days and get methadone.</v>

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>So they would take the bus up northwest.</v>

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.433
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sitting there,</v>

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>he's passed the fuck out and there's got to be just six inches of poplar.</v>

11
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>This guy's been passed out for 20 minutes.</v>

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I point my ass at him and I lift up my hips and a little bit,</v>

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I kept my asshole just pointing out that even if it wasn't pointed at him,</v>

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't ricochet off the chair and go straight through his mouth.</v>

15
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Like he's sitting there and I let her fuck go out.</v>

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I could live to be 80 he lifted his eyes like this person,</v>

17
00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

21
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.243

34
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 1>This is why I hate when I read posts.</v>
