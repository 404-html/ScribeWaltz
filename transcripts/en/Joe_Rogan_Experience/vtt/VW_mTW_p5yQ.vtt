<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>seemed like very cool guy and a one day</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're hanging out in the back patio and</v>

36
00:01:59.181 --> 00:01:59.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

37
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the employees of the comedy store,</v>

38
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like kind of a hang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting place to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

40
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just to hang.</v>

41
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And during the course of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hang you started telling me about</v>

42
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 2>your past before you worked at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store and uh,</v>

43
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you started telling me some really</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing shit that you saw in the</v>

44
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>criminal justice system while while you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were working there.</v>

45
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fascinating subject and uh,</v>

46
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it on a podcast.</v>

47
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 2>So here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

48
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured why not?</v>

49
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up so I may as well tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

50
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you tell him so much?</v>

51
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 2>He did for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was a criminal defense attorney for</v>

52
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was for the first year or two in</v>

53
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 2>central Wisconsin and then I moved down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Dane County,</v>

54
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where Madison is,</v>

55
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Wisconsin,</v>

56
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 2>all that fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the capital of the state.</v>

57
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to my friend Doug during</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

58
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Doug Darren.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 2>he lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a great comedy club.</v>

61
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really does.</v>

62
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>It's an awesome town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very liberal town,</v>

63
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>very liberal town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you would think that because it's</v>

64
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:14.251
<v Speaker 3>very liberal that black people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>treated well there and it is absolutely</v>

65
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 3>not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the like if you're black in</v>

66
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've seen the studies,</v>

67
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 3>you've seen the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen riots,</v>

68
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 3>like things are not good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not being treated well.</v>

69
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 3>And you would think that the worst place</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be would be where you see riots</v>

70
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 3>happening like Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually it's Madison,</v>

71
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no place our black people more poor in</v>

72
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 3>relation to the white people around them</v>
<v Speaker 3>than Madison,</v>

73
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

74
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:48.871
<v Speaker 3>Where else do black children get</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested more often in comparison with</v>

75
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 3>white children then Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>

76
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You would think at Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama.</v>

77
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 3>You would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are those pictures that I saw</v>

78
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 3>people getting hoses turned on him or</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog sent home.</v>

79
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I bet that's where they treat black</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks like,</v>

80
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

81
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 3>it's Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>

82
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.550
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think is causing that mean?</v>

83
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Why is this one area in your assessment</v>
<v Speaker 3>from working there for 10 years?</v>

84
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it like this?</v>

85
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

86
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a ton of different</v>

87
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 3>factors and all the factors boiled down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to racism.</v>

88
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's kind of condescending for me</v>

89
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 3>to be a white guy from the midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colin racism on everybody,</v>

90
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just going to tell you what I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>observed and you know what the numbers</v>

91
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 3>show because the thing is that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>argue with this statistics.</v>

92
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 3>If this ever came down to an argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether or not these numbers are</v>

93
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 3>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are being treated fairly.</v>

94
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 3>We know where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they're,</v>

95
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 3>they're in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can point to the actual people.</v>

96
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 3>They could raise their hands if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to and say,</v>

97
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think really what's important,</v>

98
00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you pointed out was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific crimes where a white guy and a</v>

99
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 3>black guy with no record did the exact</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

100
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 3>The difference in punishment between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>white car,</v>

101
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 3>the black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is so if you want to count</v>

102
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 3>numbers of people that have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested,</v>

103
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a possibility that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>runs into that quagmire.</v>

104
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how many black people are</v>

105
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many white people are there?</v>

106
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Where's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they in bad neighborhoods where</v>

107
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>these things are taking place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you're talking about is the</v>

108
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 3>exact same crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

109
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 3>So you can really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you really see the obvious contrast?</v>

110
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best example is burglary.</v>

112
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 3>So burglary's a crime that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple stages to burglary.</v>

113
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people who are very good at</v>

114
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 3>burglary who will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 3>knock on a house and announced</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

116
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 3>say eight cathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to try and avoid being charged with</v>

117
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 3>burglary under the statute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the way it's worded.</v>

118
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 3>But teenagers do burglary at different</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

119
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>They wait until somebody is out of town</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they know,</v>

120
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they robbed their parents' house and</v>

121
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 3>they'll take their playstations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll take their liquor and everything</v>

122
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 3>and they get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll usually do a couple of them and</v>

123
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 3>they'll get caught in a group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that's your first trip into the</v>

124
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 3>justice system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are probably in Dane County,</v>

125
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to get a deferred</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecution agreement.</v>

126
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 3>And if you keep your nose clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get an expunction,</v>

127
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 3>which is where the judge says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the community would be</v>

128
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 3>harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you would be helped by</v>

129
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>making it.</v>

130
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Like this never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the police can keep a report of it,</v>

131
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 3>but nobody will ever know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

132
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 3>the black kids don't get the offer of</v>
<v Speaker 3>expunction right out of the gates the</v>

133
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 3>the white kids do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when they fuck up and they do</v>

134
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 3>because they are 19 and a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>white kids are doing or stealing for</v>

135
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 3>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

136
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

137
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sensationalize it not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as to what you do.</v>

138
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 3>So they'll steal for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll get popped again or they'll get</v>

139
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 3>popped for curfew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now the deferred prosecution</v>

140
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 3>agreement is polled and so they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>technically convicted of a felony.</v>

141
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 3>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white kids will still have options</v>

142
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 3>of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me give this another shot.</v>

143
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I'll plead to more offenses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll plead the more the bail jumpings</v>

144
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 3>let's haggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's tag along what we're going to do.</v>

145
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Because they've already entered a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conviction or entered a plea on the</v>

146
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>record to the felony for burglary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they still have options.</v>

147
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get probation.</v>

148
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might get six months conditional</v>

149
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 3>time in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to get probation.</v>

150
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 3>And the black kids who fuck up the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

151
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 3>who were charged with the same offense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my experience and what I mean what</v>

152
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 3>everybody else notices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to prison,</v>

153
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 3>they just off to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So white burglars in there early,</v>

154
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late teens,</v>

155
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 3>early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conviction,</v>

156
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 3>deferred prosecution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of expunction then still</v>

157
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 3>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they get probation,</v>

158
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>black kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one chance prison,</v>

159
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>and once they go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really get out of that system</v>

160
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 3>very long because they just keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching you up on probation or parole</v>

161
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>violations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's just one example where</v>

162
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 3>same number of convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's a kid with no</v>
<v Speaker 3>convictions are a bunch of convictions.</v>

164
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 3>The determining factor was the race of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kid because they're both poor.</v>

165
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the white burglar defendants and the</v>

166
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 3>black burglar defendants are generally</v>
<v Speaker 3>both poor because if your parents have</v>

167
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just pay the restitution and you</v>

168
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 3>kind of walk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

169
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Not In every case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when there's money over the barrel,</v>

170
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 3>when you can pay the restitution in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal case,</v>

171
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 3>it's such a rare thing that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecution will bend over backwards to</v>

172
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 3>help you get that money to the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you fucked over.</v>

173
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's all they would have to do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay the equal amount.</v>

174
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>And they could skate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

175
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't skate completely.</v>

176
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.590
<v Speaker 3>But since so few people ever get their</v>
<v Speaker 3>money back from the prosecuted,</v>

177
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 3>you know from the prosecution and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>

178
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.580
<v Speaker 3>anytime you can put the money up they</v>
<v Speaker 3>will bend over backwards for me.</v>

179
00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 3>So for a theft case in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

180
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could conceivably not be punished</v>

181
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 3>for breaking into someone's house and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing something if you pay them for</v>

182
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 3>it back.</v>

183
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could act a breaking in,</v>

184
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 3>you won't be penalized for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems crazy.</v>

185
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you can pay for it,</v>

186
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 3>like think I put yourself in the shoes</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a prosecutor where day in day out you</v>

187
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 3>convict people crimes and you give them</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

188
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 3>But then there's these victims and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ever get to do is read a report.</v>

189
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 3>All they ever get to do is sit in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chair and say,</v>

190
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 3>you really screwed me on this one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a lot of times the defendant</v>

191
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even fucking look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they never get to come with a win</v>

192
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 3>for their victims and paying restitution</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a win for the victims.</v>

193
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't ignore that.</v>

194
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I totally get it from a rational</v>

195
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just seems fucked.</v>

196
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean that literally is buying your way</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of jail.</v>

197
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.510
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

198
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who figures out a way to come up</v>

199
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 3>with the money to pay for it or they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the money to pay for and they were</v>

200
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 3>just stealing for a kick or just to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of shit versus someone who has no</v>

201
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only difference being is that the</v>

202
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 3>one person is able to come up with some</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash.</v>

203
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

204
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course if you're,</v>

205
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is if the charges are already</v>

206
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 3>filed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to plead to</v>

207
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to have to do a deferred</v>

208
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 3>prosecution agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they'll make it as as easy as</v>

209
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you were working there and you</v>

210
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 3>observe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

211
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:40.761
<v Speaker 3>you were there for 10 years doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did it really start to sink in that</v>

212
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 3>this was sort of an impossible system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't want to be a part of it?</v>

213
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.873
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

214
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So in order to combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

215
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I guess the view that people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming increasingly more violent,</v>

216
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.830
<v Speaker 3>Dane county did this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Special Investigations Unit and the</v>

217
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Special Investigations Unit was</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly a race blind selection of the</v>

218
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:03.380
<v Speaker 3>10 most dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

219
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 3>individuals in Dane county most likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to re offend and hurt somebody else.</v>

220
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And they staffed it with the Department</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Justice and probation and parole and</v>

221
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 3>some other people that we didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they staffed it about.</v>

222
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they just discussed these issues</v>

223
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 3>and the sheriff's department and the US</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attorney's office and the,</v>

224
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 3>and they made the list of these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they thought were the most</v>

225
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 3>dangerous in Dane County.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they summoned them all to a</v>

226
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 3>meeting where they threatened him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

227
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:34.464
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

228
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>if you step out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fucking max you out on</v>

229
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you spit on the sidewalk ticket,</v>

230
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 3>if you disorderly conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hit you with disorderly</v>

231
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 3>conduct as a repeater and try to throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>you in prison for it.</v>

232
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 3>So you cock off even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're taking the ride.</v>

233
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

234
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>we have some services.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a place where you can apply</v>

235
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 3>for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were all black.</v>

236
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
<v Speaker 3>That was when I knew there was no</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking point to this because in Dane</v>

237
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 3>county,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are like 4.6% of the population or</v>

238
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 3>something is black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't all like the top 10 most</v>

239
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>dangerous people in Dane county are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>all black.</v>

240
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.720
<v Speaker 3>I know this because some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous people in Dane county where my</v>

241
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 3>other clients and they're white and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

242
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I looked at the list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

243
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 3>I got other guys that belong on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>list.</v>

244
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I had a number of people on the list</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it first came out.</v>

245
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 3>And then when they redid the list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a couple more.</v>

246
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 3>And when they redid the list with a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

247
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.113
<v Speaker 3>all black.</v>

248
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 3>So I know black people are not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're normal.</v>

249
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I know they're just like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they,</v>

250
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cause it's white or black.</v>

251
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 3>The coin flip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>white or black.</v>

252
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 3>They're telling me it came up 20 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a row on heads.</v>

253
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Like random chance doesn't even account</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this.</v>

254
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:06.080
<v Speaker 3>There's no race blind way to they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they told me afterwards,</v>

255
00:13:06.081 --> 00:13:06.491
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

256
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 3>we did it in a race blind way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you did.</v>

257
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 3>You might have thought you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the system doesn't even understand</v>

258
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 3>how racist it is.</v>

259
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.450
<v Speaker 2>How could they say they're doing it in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>race blind way?</v>

260
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you legitimately think through</v>

261
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>are more dangerous people that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>working under you or that were um,</v>

262
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.760
<v Speaker 2>being represented by you rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

263
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was their criteria?</v>

264
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>What were they judging on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a judging on how many</v>

265
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 2>convictions the violence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction.</v>

266
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the criteria?</v>

267
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a,</v>

268
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of convictions and offense</v>

269
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>severity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

270
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.290
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try a lot to figure out a good</v>

271
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:44.850
<v Speaker 2>metric to predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:46.560
<v Speaker 2>new criminality and it never really</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

273
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 2>It was patterned after</v>

274
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.950
<v Speaker 3>program that they did in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of like they took the names</v>

275
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.280
<v Speaker 3>and birth dates off of bunch of files</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they pass them around and</v>

276
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.910
<v Speaker 3>miraculously every single one of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>was black.</v>

277
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Now numbers wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that possible?</v>

278
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Like is it possible that all the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were the top 20 had the most amount</v>

279
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:13.860
<v Speaker 2>of violent convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of this,</v>

280
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:15.360
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of that and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

281
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:17.130
<v Speaker 2>they just happened to be black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

282
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.180
<v Speaker 3>It is not possible because I had other</v>
<v Speaker 3>clients who beat them.</v>

283
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need the criteria.</v>

284
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I've worst people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in that courthouse had</v>

285
00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:30.000
<v Speaker 2>somebody that was worse than anybody on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking list.</v>

286
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.390
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying like literally the,</v>

287
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 2>you could replace the list with white</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were violent,</v>

288
00:14:36.961 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>dangerous criminals and it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better choice.</v>

289
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dangerous.</v>

290
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 2>It's so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were not even in the top 10.</v>

291
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

292
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they wanted,</v>

293
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.130
<v Speaker 3>like if they wanted to know who the</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest fucking maniacs and that in Dane</v>

294
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.870
<v Speaker 3>county where they could have just asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>the defense attorneys,</v>

295
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.520
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have told them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

296
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.460
<v Speaker 2>But she knew the answers that isn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tricky situation to be in.</v>

297
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that.</v>

298
00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly stressful being someone</v>

299
00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:03.840
<v Speaker 2>who's representing someone who you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like a real criminal,</v>

300
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.960
<v Speaker 2>a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to try to get them off.</v>

301
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's,</v>

302
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.170
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is this system only works</v>

303
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.580
<v Speaker 3>if you just come at the other side and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side just comes at you because</v>

304
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

305
00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:23.280
<v Speaker 3>they've got the police behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got the fact that they've got a</v>

306
00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:25.230
<v Speaker 3>badge that impresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

307
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.910
<v Speaker 3>civilians during the jury trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got prosecutors who have access</v>

308
00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:34.200
<v Speaker 3>to state crime labs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come at you and if they</v>

309
00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's their fault.</v>

310
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.010
<v Speaker 3>So they have to win these ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

311
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 3>and the guilty guys give you an</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to practice because you,</v>

312
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.470
<v Speaker 3>if you only took the cases of people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you thought were innocent,</v>

313
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.730
<v Speaker 3>you would suck when it came time to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>their trial.</v>

314
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to sharpen your clause.</v>

315
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And the best way to do it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

316
00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 3>when with someone where you know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking did it and when it clean on</v>

317
00:16:03.301 --> 00:16:06.360
<v Speaker 3>technical points because those technical</v>
<v Speaker 3>points like,</v>

318
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not getting evidence in or when a</v>

319
00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:12.480
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor is asking questions during</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild deer,</v>

320
00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't be that type a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those little back flips and shit,</v>

321
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.370
<v Speaker 3>those will pay off when you actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a client that you don't think did</v>

322
00:16:20.371 --> 00:16:21.204
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

323
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

324
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

325
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of your obligation.</v>

326
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost treat it like it's a game</v>

327
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that you're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some sort of a technical game.</v>

328
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to treat it as a technical game</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you will lose</v>

329
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.930
<v Speaker 2>because is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something,</v>

330
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:37.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd know very,</v>

331
00:16:37.891 --> 00:16:40.710
<v Speaker 2>very little about the law in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending people,</v>

332
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:45.060
<v Speaker 2>but is it something that you think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a almost like sort of a chess game?</v>

333
00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a bunch of pieces and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to manipulate them correctly and</v>

334
00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:53.391
<v Speaker 2>you have to be aware of the massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive amounts of things that have been</v>

335
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:57.720
<v Speaker 2>written on each individual subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether individual crime,</v>

336
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.580
<v Speaker 2>what precedents have been set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to establish whether or not they're,</v>

337
00:17:02.581 --> 00:17:06.090
<v Speaker 2>your client was treated fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that based on precedents to,</v>

338
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.381
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

339
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:09.930
<v Speaker 3>there's precedent for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

340
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>346 million people in the country,</v>

341
00:17:13.051 --> 00:17:17.010
<v Speaker 3>like they've had some court cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

342
00:17:17.011 --> 00:17:20.370
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to know the general progress of</v>

343
00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:23.250
<v Speaker 3>how a trial goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to know when someone can invoke</v>

344
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.950
<v Speaker 3>a right and when they can't invoke a</v>
<v Speaker 3>right time.</v>

345
00:17:25.951 --> 00:17:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Limits are kind of important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

346
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.600
<v Speaker 2>time limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time limits.</v>

347
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

348
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.130
<v Speaker 2>and it's like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what statute of limitations?</v>

349
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Time limits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you mean?</v>

350
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Statute of limitations to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're in court and you don't</v>

351
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 3>object on time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

352
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 3>you're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they have to argue in a different</v>

353
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>way to try and get it flipped over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's always arguing.</v>

354
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

355
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a game and it is kind of mental.</v>

356
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an example.</v>

357
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this to a guy,</v>

358
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.500
<v Speaker 3>he's now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

359
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.330
<v Speaker 3>he's not a prosecutor there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you go into courtrooms in large</v>

360
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take their inmates from the in</v>

361
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 3>custody section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there'll be in a jail next to</v>

362
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 3>her and they'll bring them from a tunnel</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a little holding cells in the</v>

363
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 3>courthouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll bring them in one side of the</v>

364
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 3>courtroom and then they'll put the jury</v>
<v Speaker 3>box on the opposite side of the</v>

365
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 3>courtroom so that the in custody</v>
<v Speaker 3>defendant doesn't walk past them on the</v>

366
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:24.534
<v Speaker 3>way in and out.</v>

367
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Because if they were to get sentenced</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the jury were sitting there on their</v>

368
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 3>way out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there may be some choice words.</v>

369
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 3>So they separate the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

370
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.330
<v Speaker 3>and also because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're worried about them fleeing or</v>

371
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.660
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the net,</v>

372
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.700
<v Speaker 3>the actual effect of that is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor's sits closer to the jury box</v>

373
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 3>and they always have a case officer who</v>
<v Speaker 3>sits next to the prosecutor in their</v>

374
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 3>dress uniform or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

375
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 3>they're working a form and they look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jury and they monitor the jury and</v>

376
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 3>they keep their notes and they help them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they mug and they listened to the</v>

377
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 3>entire trial so they know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

378
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's a great asset to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a substantial part of the advantage</v>

379
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:08.730
<v Speaker 3>that they get from having that chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having the officer being able to look at</v>

380
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.623
<v Speaker 3>the jury.</v>

381
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about you sitting in a room and</v>

382
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck is going on.</v>

383
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a knife fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe somebody supposedly shot at</v>

384
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:24.171
<v Speaker 3>somebody and a jury and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the witness leans forward and says</v>

385
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 3>something and you don't know if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>should believe him.</v>

386
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 3>So you look to the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>judges blank and then you look to the</v>

387
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 3>court reporter and the clerk of courts</v>
<v Speaker 3>blank blank because they don't want you</v>

388
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 3>to be able to read them or they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on other shit or they're</v>

389
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on writing what everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>is saying.</v>

390
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

391
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you get to the defense table and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

392
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defendant looking guilty as shit as they</v>

393
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 3>always do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

394
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.380
<v Speaker 3>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

395
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.490
<v Speaker 3>and then you get to the prosecutor and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cop and there the cops looking at</v>

396
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:57.150
<v Speaker 3>you and he just gives you an [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there you go.</v>

397
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 3>You've got some validation for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicion that the person was not</v>

398
00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that rolls forward from time to</v>

399
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:06.120
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you tell jokes on stage,</v>

400
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.680
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you hold for a second and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking look at people and then they</v>

401
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 3>start to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same shit.</v>

402
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just their work in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't even know that they're</v>

403
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they lean forward to answer a</v>

404
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 3>question that the prosecutor acid they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to answer,</v>

405
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 3>or when they lean back because you asked</v>
<v Speaker 3>them a question and they're about to</v>

406
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 3>burn you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their work in the fucking crowd,</v>

407
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 3>they're just working the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I would do is I would show up</v>

408
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 3>early as shit and I would take their</v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

409
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I would just put my shit at their table</v>
<v Speaker 3>because their name's not on the table.</v>

410
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Most juvenile bullshit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would take the table and I would put</v>

411
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:52.681
<v Speaker 3>all my stuff there and I would make them</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask the judge to move me because that</v>

412
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:57.650
<v Speaker 3>was not an argument that someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Harvard came to the courthouse</v>

413
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.670
<v Speaker 3>prepared to make cause my opponent that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did go to Harvard and fuck Harvard</v>

414
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.750
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know like this is the streets like</v>

415
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 3>this is fuck around time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did that just to an horse,</v>

416
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 3>him mentally so that when the trial did</v>
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>

417
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 3>he was uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care if I won or lost that</v>

418
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted that chair.</v>

419
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I wanted that cheer cause I knew what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do.</v>

420
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 3>Looking back at forth that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people and just taking them that</v>

421
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 3>much further from the physical proximity</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the jury putting us clothes.</v>

422
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:34.330
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more so than that.</v>

423
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to make him be a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>six year old to the judge.</v>

424
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful movement.</v>

425
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.450
<v Speaker 3>That's an excellent move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

426
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's playing around and it's</v>

427
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the whole system's kind of</v>

428
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 3>juked anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

429
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Well even your best to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

430
00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing is like if I can play</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that advantage and it's not</v>

431
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 3>unethical or illegal because I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain why that chair is better and why</v>

432
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:08.020
<v Speaker 3>I want it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm,</v>

433
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I kind of have to play that angle</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I would hate for my client that</v>

434
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:12.723
<v Speaker 3>day to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

435
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 3>so you had a chance to really mind fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>them before you started and you didn't.</v>

436
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.880
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm convicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

437
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 3>Well thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not gonna,</v>

438
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.330
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

439
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:27.331
<v Speaker 3>how many guys who are working in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>position have such a clear mindset</v>

440
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

441
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 3>How many people have sort of punched out</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a while cause they've been doing</v>

442
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:34.210
<v Speaker 3>it a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is that a public misconception that</v>

443
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:36.850
<v Speaker 3>you see in like movies where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

444
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:37.311
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

445
00:22:37.311 --> 00:22:38.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

446
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.840
<v Speaker 3>the criminal defendant that gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>assigned by the state doesn't really</v>

447
00:22:40.841 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does a half house job and the guy gets</v>

448
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 3>sent up river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that common or is it bullshit?</v>

449
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit because we all do care.</v>

450
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're competitive.</v>

451
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Even if we hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to try to win.</v>

452
00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Especially if we hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've pulled like some of my best</v>

453
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:05.161
<v Speaker 3>moves all the time for people that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>loathed because it was the hardest move</v>

454
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 3>to pull and it would be the biggest win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

455
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it doesn't matter how you feel</v>

456
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:12.680
<v Speaker 3>about the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like winning?</v>

457
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I keep winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see somebody and they want</v>

458
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 3>seven years and you go fuck you three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't say fuck you,</v>

459
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but you just think you want seven years</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this shit.</v>

460
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Seven years of someone's life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maniac.</v>

461
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want this guy out,</v>

462
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 3>but seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

463
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 3>So then you work on an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they after work you can tell</v>

464
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:39.871
<v Speaker 3>everybody that the prosecution asked for</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven and you got him to wow.</v>

465
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>winning is its own reward.</v>

466
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard a lawyer put it quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

467
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

468
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about it before on the</v>

469
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 2>podcast where I think that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem with cops arresting</v>

470
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>criminals and not that they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a real problem in that it</v>

471
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 2>becomes a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're trying to,</v>

472
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to catch people for</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things and you're trying to lock</v>

473
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 2>them up and when you're trying to win</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that is a win.</v>

474
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get someone,</v>

475
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you lock them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you arrest them,</v>

476
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you catch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get convicted,</v>

477
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 2>they go up river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat him up river,</v>

478
00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I went and that is an absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

479
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.760
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of what,</v>

480
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 2>what we've sort of developed all</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout high school years and junior</v>

481
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 2>high school and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids play sports and we developed this</v>

482
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 2>winning mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game is to be one,</v>

483
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a game of pool or lawn</v>

484
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 2>darts are fucking basketball.</v>

485
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>People are always trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have people that have</v>

486
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.470
<v Speaker 2>raised in some of the most intense</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments of their life,</v>

487
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:41.600
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been involved in competitive</v>

488
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:44.480
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you've been on a championship</v>

489
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:48.770
<v Speaker 2>baseball team or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go from that and your,</v>

490
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.620
<v Speaker 2>your next experiences in life or being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>police officer,</v>

491
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you're going to definitely take that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports mindset and apply it to chasing</v>

492
00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:58.370
<v Speaker 2>down criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it could be good and it can be bad.</v>

493
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:03.110
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is when people start</v>
<v Speaker 2>justifying certain things like planting</v>

494
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:06.620
<v Speaker 2>evidence and doing things along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines in order to get a conviction</v>

495
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.740
<v Speaker 2>because they want to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when shit gets really,</v>

496
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 2>really scary because someone has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible amount of power.</v>

497
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 2>And if someone is doing something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you look more guilty,</v>

498
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:20.330
<v Speaker 2>just so that they can win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

499
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

500
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.250
<v Speaker 4>when people were upset about the New</v>
<v Speaker 4>England patriots being accused of</v>

501
00:25:26.251 --> 00:25:26.830
<v Speaker 4>cheating.</v>

502
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deflate gate to was Jamie,</v>

503
00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:30.940
<v Speaker 2>can you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't necessarily understand</v>

504
00:25:30.941 --> 00:25:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

505
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

506
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.500
<v Speaker 4>during the nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the championship game a</v>

507
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.490
<v Speaker 4>couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the,</v>

508
00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:40.810
<v Speaker 4>before the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a trainer supposedly had let some air</v>

509
00:25:40.811 --> 00:25:42.760
<v Speaker 4>out of the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would make it easier to grip and</v>

510
00:25:42.761 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 4>throw and catch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

511
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.210
<v Speaker 4>that's what I don't understand it does</v>
<v Speaker 4>that been proven?</v>

512
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.680
<v Speaker 4>That had happened that it's easier to</v>
<v Speaker 4>catch a ball.</v>

513
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:53.350
<v Speaker 4>And there's other NFL quarterbacks I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard recently that admit to over</v>

514
00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:55.240
<v Speaker 4>inflating a ball for the similar</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

515
00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 4>It's just preference on how to grip a</v>
<v Speaker 4>boss and my baseball players do stuff to</v>

516
00:26:00.581 --> 00:26:01.450
<v Speaker 4>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

517
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.300
<v Speaker 4>pitchers aren't allowed to scuff it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

518
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.270
<v Speaker 4>they beat up a ball so that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>brand new and slippery at all.</v>

519
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 2>This is why I got confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hasn't had been proven or am I wrong</v>

520
00:26:10.541 --> 00:26:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that it's like there's no like</v>
<v Speaker 2>measurable.</v>

521
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it was like the amount that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually was for there was like a 0.0018</v>

522
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 4>amount of air selected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an immeasurable amount of dif.</v>

523
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I really don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

524
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.860
<v Speaker 4>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was bullshit.</v>

525
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit chair most part yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it still isn't,</v>

526
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 4>it's just that they want to win and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants to win in this case,</v>

527
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is like and then uh,</v>

528
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.210
<v Speaker 4>cause they couldn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very much on when they were</v>

529
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 4>listening to everybody's place cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

530
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 4>they were reviewing everyone else's</v>
<v Speaker 4>plays in intercepting their</v>

531
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 4>communications.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are they doing that?</v>

532
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 4>Radios and that's illegal.</v>

533
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 3>It's not illegal depending on the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're in,</v>

534
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's frowned upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

535
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 3>that's unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The teams are not supposed to be</v>

536
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.950
<v Speaker 3>eavesdropping on the play calls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

537
00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 3>So they were taping them to videotaping</v>
<v Speaker 3>practices and catching hand signals.</v>

538
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

539
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 3>And Dis ciphering hand signals like</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking enemies.</v>

540
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

541
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like some World War II Japanese</v>

542
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.950
<v Speaker 3>like code type Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

543
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they hold up this big ass</v>

544
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.640
<v Speaker 3>science now with like five different</v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

545
00:27:12.641 --> 00:27:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Your decoy guys given fake hand signals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all kinds of things going on in</v>

546
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 3>that center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Subterfuge.</v>

547
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danger.</v>

548
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.821
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

549
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.490
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the cops are kind of like</v>

550
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 3>the New England patriots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to win anyway.</v>

551
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Why do you cheat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to win because the Patriots</v>

552
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 3>were going to win almost all of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>games anyway.</v>

553
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 3>But if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planning of evidence and stuff like</v>

554
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.980
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more sensational.</v>

555
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.980
<v Speaker 3>It's more rare than you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cops trying to get a particular</v>

556
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:48.591
<v Speaker 3>person is more rare than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like most cops are pretty good and don't</v>

557
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 3>hold grudges like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you see a cop who's arrested</v>

558
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:55.260
<v Speaker 3>somebody like four times before they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>

559
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.080
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit of trash talk in a</v>

560
00:27:58.081 --> 00:27:58.831
<v Speaker 3>little bit of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

561
00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:02.310
<v Speaker 3>how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they have relationships with people</v>

562
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:05.250
<v Speaker 3>that they have to arrest a lot to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not always negative.</v>

563
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hilarious.</v>

564
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like the sheep dog and the coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those cartoons born Sam Morton and</v>

565
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 3>monorail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

566
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

567
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:20.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not as bad as people make them</v>

568
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 3>out to be in that angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there have been some terrible</v>

569
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:26.720
<v Speaker 3>scandals like rampart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most almost,</v>

570
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's not,</v>

571
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.090
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit that's not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

572
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the TV shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What really happens is they're just not</v>

573
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 3>allowed to lose any interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can't,</v>

574
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.180
<v Speaker 3>like when they finally decided that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to chase people in</v>

575
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're going like one 20 less people</v>

576
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 3>started dying because the cops actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the discretion to go,</v>

577
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 3>we don't need to win all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

578
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but all these other things like domestic</v>
<v Speaker 3>violence arrests or shoplifting or</v>

579
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Tasers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they can't leave,</v>

580
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:06.150
<v Speaker 3>they can net,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't back off a cop.</v>

581
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 3>You can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

582
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they have to get more cops and</v>

583
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:16.140
<v Speaker 3>they have to keep getting more cops with</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger guns until they get you.</v>

584
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 3>They not allowed to walk away and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not allowed to walk away</v>

585
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 3>from like personal interaction that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem is that we don't let</v>

586
00:29:24.661 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 3>them be themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make them be kind of these,</v>

587
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just always challenging people.</v>

588
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to do that.</v>

589
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 3>But that's how they're taught that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to kind of act around people and</v>

590
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 3>they drop it whenever they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of them</v>

591
00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:46.510
<v Speaker 2>some guys never drop it cause they</v>
<v Speaker 2>really get off on that shit.</v>

593
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your hands on the hood of the car.</v>

594
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 2>So spread your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Sir.</v>

595
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of them would not like to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>to people that way.</v>

596
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just that they're taught,</v>

597
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 2>they have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in a terror,</v>

598
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>terrifying and dangerous situation a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of times where they literally have to</v>

599
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 2>have complete total control of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and compliance.</v>

600
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:10.100
<v Speaker 2>If they don't have compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it leaves open the door to,</v>

601
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 2>to weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a guy's not assuming the position,</v>

602
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:15.630
<v Speaker 2>they can become more threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get it in,</v>

603
00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in violent crime situations,</v>

604
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's just gotta be insanely</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to figure out when to turn</v>

605
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:24.160
<v Speaker 2>that on and when to turn that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

606
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

607
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people obviously have problems with</v>

608
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that to fucking difficult job</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally to manage and</v>

609
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.830
<v Speaker 2>psychologically to manage.</v>

610
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.580
<v Speaker 2>You're in this position where you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun all the time and a good percentage</v>

611
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 2>of the people you talk to all day or</v>
<v Speaker 2>full of shit,</v>

612
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.780
<v Speaker 2>they're lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're about to commit a crime mean</v>

613
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.690
<v Speaker 2>imagine running into people and almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone you see is involved in</v>

614
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:50.440
<v Speaker 2>something they shouldn't be involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you took the job because you like</v>

615
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

616
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:55.630
<v Speaker 2>like you took the job because you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect people and have people</v>

617
00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.870
<v Speaker 2>respect you and all you get is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespect and picking up shoplifters</v>

618
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 2>and heaven turds thrown at you by some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then teenagers make fun of you</v>

619
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>remember what it was like after nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that big shift came about and people</v>

620
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 2>like really appreciative of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started calling them a first</v>

621
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 2>responders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the first time they had to</v>

622
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:18.160
<v Speaker 2>call them first responders.</v>

623
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like a common expression in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>news cause it used to be,</v>

624
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

625
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 2>emergency people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine 11,</v>

626
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it would be cops or firemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when they started calling him first</v>

627
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:32.521
<v Speaker 2>responders and people were like super</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to see cops and super happy to see</v>

628
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.150
<v Speaker 2>firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for quite a while.</v>

629
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:38.490
<v Speaker 2>They've got a lot of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

630
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

631
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.910
<v Speaker 2>But it kind of wore off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

632
00:31:42.911 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 2>firefighters I think still get there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get most of what they used to get.</v>

633
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't get the full blast that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to get,</v>

634
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.930
<v Speaker 2>but now cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time one of them fucks up showing</v>

635
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 2>up on video and it's reflecting poorly</v>
<v Speaker 2>on everybody.</v>

636
00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>But we really do have to take any</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration to two factors when you're</v>

637
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 2>looking at these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the sheer amount of crime you're</v>

638
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 2>talking about that takes place on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis.</v>

639
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So what you're saying is if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

640
00:32:11.981 --> 00:32:12.820
<v Speaker 2>think of the many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

641
00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:14.350
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many cities in this country and the</v>

642
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:14.891
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

643
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:15.521
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

644
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>many cops having interactions with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

645
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people who have committed crimes.</v>

646
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see a video of a cop doing something</v>

647
00:32:24.011 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up in consideration to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you're talking about these</v>

648
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:31.270
<v Speaker 2>millions of interactions and to have one</v>
<v Speaker 2>every couple months.</v>

649
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit,</v>

650
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 2>what one of these fucking people going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop doing that?</v>

651
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

652
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>it is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good that we have a now to catch</v>

653
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:43.010
<v Speaker 2>those people and weed those people out</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't exist anymore.</v>

654
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But B,</v>

655
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

656
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly like had an impact</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that they're going to be filmed</v>

657
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 2>w knowing that it's likely to be filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna eliminate some of the,</v>

658
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the corruption,</v>

659
00:32:57.561 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 2>some of the evil shit that we've caught</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops doing.</v>

660
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.840
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely gonna have pressure on</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and social pressure that's going to</v>

661
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 2>cause people to change their opinions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and change the way they conduct business</v>

662
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 2>or they conduct the business of law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement.</v>

663
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers are shockingly small.</v>

664
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 2>If you really stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>

665
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be like a cop</v>

666
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 2>pathologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying we really should</v>

667
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:25.820
<v Speaker 2>take into consideration whenever we do</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of these conversations about it,</v>

668
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking cops there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many crimes they're handling on a</v>

669
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:32.700
<v Speaker 2>daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how insanely brutal that must be on</v>

670
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>your psychological system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your emotional system.</v>

671
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've maintained a few times and I don't</v>

672
00:33:37.821 --> 00:33:40.590
<v Speaker 2>think it's a job that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a job that very few people</v>

673
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 2>are qualified for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a,</v>

674
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.430
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a very strong mind to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to handle that in a very fair</v>

675
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:47.264
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

676
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

677
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be intensely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

678
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine just getting shot at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>

679
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking high speed chases catching</v>

680
00:33:56.151 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 2>people in the middle of the crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Domestic violence.</v>

681
00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not all excitement.</v>

683
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sad.</v>

684
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 3>It's sad for them because they'll show</v>
<v Speaker 3>up four or five times to the same house.</v>

685
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

686
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't,</v>

687
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 3>they don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they'll get all the</v>

688
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get a case nice and ready and</v>

689
00:34:16.101 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 3>then the lady doesn't show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cases dismissed and then four months</v>

690
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 3>later there's another call and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at the house.</v>

691
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 3>That shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a great on them I'm sure.</v>

692
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.780
<v Speaker 3>But like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the police brutality videos bring</v>

693
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:36.791
<v Speaker 3>to light kind of a way that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>officers have been getting away with</v>

694
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 3>treating people like Rodney King was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

695
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 3>was one of the first prime examples of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cops get away with doing this to</v>

696
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.300
<v Speaker 3>people and yeah.</v>

697
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 2>And it don't you think in the Rodney</v>
<v Speaker 2>King situation though,</v>

698
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty extreme because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a PCP it up,</v>

699
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>dude that went on a high speed chase and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot more to that video then</v>

700
00:34:58.101 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 2>what we saw on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not excusing them for beating</v>

701
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

702
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 2>they should have definitely handcuffed</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and they should have figured out a</v>

703
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>way with all those guys to restrain him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have the physical manpower</v>

704
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:12.090
<v Speaker 2>to restrain that guy without beating on</v>
<v Speaker 2>him like that.</v>

705
00:35:12.091 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

706
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

707
00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my personal belief is if you lead the</v>

708
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 3>police on a high speed chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should beat your ass when you get</v>

709
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:23.040
<v Speaker 3>out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

710
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what they generally do</v>

711
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 3>because they're jacked up from having to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive at that speed.</v>

712
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>And I don't really say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying like it's morally right.</v>

713
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying like if you're currently in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>high speed chase with the police,</v>

714
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 3>pull over slowly</v>

715
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 2>and expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 2>a few kisses on the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my problem with that.</v>

717
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with it in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like dishing out justice,</v>

718
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:49.980
<v Speaker 2>but that's first of all kind of smacks</v>
<v Speaker 2>of vigilantism.</v>

719
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second of all,</v>

720
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 2>because you're not really supposed to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that right now.</v>

721
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 2>They're not supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that I don't think they can</v>

722
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.830
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not vigilantism it's a cop.</v>

723
00:35:58.831 --> 00:35:59.551
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you call it?</v>

724
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 2>it's just inappropriate violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

726
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:06.841
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

727
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:09.540
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to take physical control</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

728
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Have somebody who just like threatened</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lives,</v>

729
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 2>like threatened the lines of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

730
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 2>50 or 60 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're going to do it fast.</v>

731
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.540
<v Speaker 2>But here's my only concern is that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would encourage people to get away with</v>

732
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:24.270
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more on the line because you know,</v>

733
00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:26.280
<v Speaker 2>if they get pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna get the fuck beat out of</v>

734
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

735
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 2>And it could cause loss of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives if they were involved in</v>

736
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 2>a car accident by someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's frantic to not get the shit beat</v>

737
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:33.910
<v Speaker 2>out of him by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

738
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>green light when someone can beat the</v>

739
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:37.861
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

740
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:38.694
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

741
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Shooting him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing him.</v>

742
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 2>It just sounds so hypocritical and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>

743
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 2>but that almost makes more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

744
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying like I greenlight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like we are dealing with</v>

745
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

746
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.970
<v Speaker 2>It's pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have going to happen.</v>

747
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out how to handle</v>

748
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want it to happen,</v>

749
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

750
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not using robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're using paypal.</v>

751
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what's most important</v>

752
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.170
<v Speaker 2>that we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

753
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.040
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we can take people and categorize</v>

754
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 2>them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this guy has x amount of melanin in</v>

755
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:17.070
<v Speaker 2>his skin and his family's from this part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>

756
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 2>so we'll apply rule A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Versus if this guy is Norwegian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white looking motherfucker like</v>

758
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You apply rule be when you look at some</v>

759
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Sweden in you when you got there from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norwegian,</v>

760
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

761
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even good at that.</v>

762
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really good at racism.</v>

763
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 2>You're a very good white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

764
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:37.020
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if you do it with white</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

765
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that racism?</v>

766
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not racism.</v>

767
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Who would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be racism.</v>

768
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.140
<v Speaker 2>It's only if it's black person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't call it,</v>

769
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:49.260
<v Speaker 2>like if I call you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say that you look Norwegian and I</v>

770
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:50.880
<v Speaker 2>nail it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is definitely not racism.</v>

771
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 2>But if I see a black person for Haiti</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like the Congo,</v>

772
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.020
<v Speaker 2>well that would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

773
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get away with that.</v>

774
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's like a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

775
00:38:01.231 --> 00:38:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I pick cotton.</v>

776
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also it was,</v>

777
00:38:03.451 --> 00:38:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the east sounded really excited when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>

778
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Like Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

779
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.350
<v Speaker 2>well that was for the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

780
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to be the tool to try and make</v>

781
00:38:11.611 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

782
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

783
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

784
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:17.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just real disturbing.</v>

785
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>It was very disturbing when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me this because it just doesn't</v>

786
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 2>make a whole lot of sense that some</v>
<v Speaker 2>place that people would think of as such</v>

787
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 2>a liberal open minded place like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madison,</v>

788
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin would be so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking backwards like that and that</v>

789
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.940
<v Speaker 2>no one's bringing this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

790
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.210
<v Speaker 2>people have tried to bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

791
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>they first started</v>

792
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>bringing it up in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since then,</v>

793
00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:40.810
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

794
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 3>a couple of places have come out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies on it.</v>

795
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically in Wisconsin,</v>

796
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>adult black men are 12 times more likely</v>

797
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 3>to be sent to prison than white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

798
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 3>black kids are 16 times more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be put into foster care than white kids.</v>

799
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course if you're in foster care</v>

800
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 3>then you're more likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribed,</v>

801
00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills and all that fun stuff.</v>

802
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 3>And even for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in La County,</v>

803
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black foster kids are eight times more</v>

804
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 3>likely to be put on behavior altering</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication,</v>

805
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 3>then white kids also in foster care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

806
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.040
<v Speaker 3>they noticed that the numbers were</v>
<v Speaker 3>really getting bad then and then they</v>

807
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:27.940
<v Speaker 3>tried some shit to fix it and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten worse.</v>

808
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>the funniest one was,</v>

809
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.230
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in 2014 then when there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was another study that says,</v>

810
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still getting worse.</v>

811
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they proposed a $250,000 a gardening</v>

812
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.620
<v Speaker 3>initiative where they would teach</v>
<v Speaker 3>children to garden.</v>

813
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 3>You're locking up 50% of all African</v>
<v Speaker 3>American men from 18 to 25 they're in</v>

814
00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:01.651
<v Speaker 3>jail or on probation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your idea is to spend a quarter of a</v>

815
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 3>million dollars on gardening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

816
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 3>fucking wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit's fucked up.</v>

817
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.030
<v Speaker 5>So what was the argument about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>gardening?</v>

818
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.170
<v Speaker 5>It was going to give them a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 5>purpose because they would see these</v>

819
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 5>flowers and fuck if I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

820
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's one of the like it's hippy</v>

821
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:25.260
<v Speaker 5>dippy bullshit is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking like,</v>

822
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like holy fucking yellow brick road.</v>

823
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.750
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like are we all grown ups in this room?</v>

824
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:37.590
<v Speaker 5>I leave really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've noticed some studies that came out</v>

825
00:40:37.591 --> 00:40:41.610
<v Speaker 5>of Norway where they took prisoners and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they showed them how to make tomato</v>

826
00:40:41.611 --> 00:40:44.370
<v Speaker 5>sandwiches and they could grow their own</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomatoes.</v>

827
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.310
<v Speaker 5>They got so much more comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But being a person like let's,</v>

828
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.400
<v Speaker 5>let's keep stealing fathers from their</v>
<v Speaker 5>children and then also,</v>

829
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 5>but you know how we took your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the magic of Patagonia.</v>

830
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

831
00:41:02.341 --> 00:41:05.130
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we fucking shattered your family but</v>

832
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.160
<v Speaker 5>aren't lilacs beautiful and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>ride the bus to come see your lilacs.</v>

833
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.330
<v Speaker 5>It's just horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

834
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.930
<v Speaker 5>if that's what they think will make a</v>
<v Speaker 5>difference,</v>

835
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.470
<v Speaker 5>then we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

836
00:41:19.471 --> 00:41:24.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's probably a good idea for</v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe a community center that wants</v>

837
00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:27.120
<v Speaker 5>to help kids out and give them some</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense of purpose,</v>

838
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 5>but a sort of subscribe that to</v>
<v Speaker 5>criminals are the people that you've</v>

839
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 5>convicted of crimes or people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've put</v>

840
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.873
<v Speaker 2>in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

841
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.150
<v Speaker 3>just anybody and you can't make people</v>
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>

842
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like we actually had a war about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

843
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.870
<v Speaker 3>There was a war about 150 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>about making people garden based on the</v>

844
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 3>color of their skin.</v>

845
00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.030
<v Speaker 2>It was the civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found an article about it.</v>

846
00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.871
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:41:55.871 --> 00:41:59.020
<v Speaker 2>The anecdotes from this are kind of fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to read it.</v>

848
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I've been locked up my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So doing programs like this are like</v>

849
00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:05.590
<v Speaker 2>planting a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you have to nurture a plant</v>

850
00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.740
<v Speaker 2>almost like a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird to think about it</v>

851
00:42:08.741 --> 00:42:11.650
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's going to show me how to</v>

852
00:42:11.651 --> 00:42:13.630
<v Speaker 2>become an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

853
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And he said that after he brained the</v>
<v Speaker 2>social worker and raped her dead body,</v>

854
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.710
<v Speaker 2>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I do it and pr style?</v>

855
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after everyone had a chance to talk,</v>

856
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 3>it was time for some hands on gardening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One table was just covered with dried</v>

857
00:42:28.301 --> 00:42:31.270
<v Speaker 3>lupin in Larkspur plants that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inmates stripped of seeds.</v>

858
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.960
<v Speaker 3>After the gardening work was done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inmates gathered again in a circle</v>

859
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.140
<v Speaker 3>to talk about how to connect what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've learned from life after they</v>

860
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.870
<v Speaker 3>released.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John is currently serving time for his</v>

861
00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:43.330
<v Speaker 3>six drunk driving convictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little too sexy.</v>

862
00:42:43.331 --> 00:42:43.480
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

863
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.450
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're a little too sultry.</v>

864
00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:46.960
<v Speaker 2>You Burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you burn sign.</v>

865
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:49.060
<v Speaker 2>You burn it a little slower but you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn.</v>

866
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:54.100
<v Speaker 2>He got to be a little more dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it's the self satisfaction.</v>

867
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.023
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

868
00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:00.310
<v Speaker 2>there's like almost like a hipstery</v>
<v Speaker 2>quality that you have to acquire over</v>

869
00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.750
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sound as well.</v>

870
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll work on that.</v>

871
00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is going on with that voice that</v>

872
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:08.230
<v Speaker 2>they do that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're men.</v>

873
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.521
<v Speaker 2>You that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

874
00:43:09.521 --> 00:43:14.230

<v Speaker 2>That dude who was a in Canada who got in</v>

875
00:43:14.231 --> 00:43:17.080
<v Speaker 2>trouble with all the ladies because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that he liked to throttle them.</v>

876
00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

878
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the guy that was on trial in</v>

879
00:43:24.371 --> 00:43:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Canada because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of girls that you hooked up with</v>

880
00:43:27.311 --> 00:43:28.330

884
00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:40.810
<v Speaker 2>this and has a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very subdued way of speaking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>

894

<v Speaker 2>There's no emotion to it.</v>

896
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like a soft rock dj,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

897
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.700
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little creepier.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what though?</v>

899
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to say I prefer it when I'm</v>

900
00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:23.260
<v Speaker 2>listening to like very intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when they're talking about like a very</v>

907
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 2>intense subject that's a hotly into</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

908
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I almost prefer it like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonjudgmental weird sort of not really a</v>

909
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 2>person way of communicating the pan</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined we going to get classical</v>

912
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 2>to speak that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm fascinating as as a comic I'm</v>

<v Speaker 2>that people can plug into.</v>

915
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Like you can become a top 40 dj and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows how to do it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

923
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>This is a bunch of different voices that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are allowed to plug into.</v>

924
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.840

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton is so bad at public</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

928
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 2>She's terrible at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

929
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you do it that long and suck</v>

932
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I think she's tired for one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet if he caught her when she was 40</v>

933
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:51.970
<v Speaker 2>she was probably a firecracker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

934
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a lady that's dealing with a</v>

935
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 2>failing older body and it's a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem for people because they don't</v>

936
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:02.610
<v Speaker 2>really get wise enough for us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider them running the nation until</v>

937
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>they're older.</v>

938
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if Katy Perry wanted to be</v>

939
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:06.570
<v Speaker 2>president tomorrow and be like pitching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I old enough,</v>

940
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.380
<v Speaker 2>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not 35 all right.</v>

941
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.370
<v Speaker 2>But for when she started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

942
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer Aniston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

943
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:13.980
<v Speaker 2>she's 35 she's like 42 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

944
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 2>She's not a good judge of character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's hot as fuck.</v>

945
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.790
<v Speaker 2>She's really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's had,</v>

946
00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:21.090
<v Speaker 2>she never did anything to her chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So strong chin.</v>

947
00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Still work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

948
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Chain is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't sell yourself short,</v>

949
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 2>but like if she wanted to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>president would be like,</v>

950
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're too vibrant.</v>

951
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You're too young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have too much going on.</v>

952
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a real catch 22 for a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause like the only way you would accept</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman in office as a woman,</v>

954
00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:41.610
<v Speaker 2>like an old withered politician like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary who's been in the trenches.</v>

955
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

956
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you kind of have to be a little</v>

957
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 2>close to death for people to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

958
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:49.440
<v Speaker 2>for president.</v>

959
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look a little bit like</v>

960
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we tried it with Obama with a,</v>

961
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>a really vibrant guy and he came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking like death came out looking 20</v>

962
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were bastard.</v>

963
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we bothered him way more than he</v>

964
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:03.420
<v Speaker 2>thought we would bother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

965
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:07.170
<v Speaker 2>100% at mean just the job itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any,</v>

966
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

967
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Like it's really difficult to be a cop</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnet time that time.</v>

968
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>What a million magnify that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably more than a million.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

971
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the sheer volume of information that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy must have to process on a daily</v>

972
00:47:25.651 --> 00:47:28.760
<v Speaker 2>basis about international affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Putin in Syria and Saudi Arabia is doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>what and what's going on in Turkey in</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

975

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 4>just has to decide bullshit over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again because your body</v>

<v Speaker 2>to take care of national stuff too.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

1036
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 4>Why else would it be mayor once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once get his freak on.</v>

1037
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.830
<v Speaker 4>I know mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing is imagine if you went</v>

1038
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 4>on</v>

1039
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 2>a path to being president 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Obama most likely dead,</v>

1040
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1041
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.470
<v Speaker 2>So think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1042
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 2>what is he now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like 50 so back then he was 30 and</v>

1043
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:39.320
<v Speaker 2>if you think about when he was 30 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thinking to himself,</v>

1044
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be the president in United</v>

1045
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on this path,</v>

1046
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm seeing all the pussy that John</v>
<v Speaker 2>F.</v>

1047
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy got and I'm seeing all the power</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all these other presidents had.</v>

1048
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 2>And I'm seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing it,</v>

1049
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 2>seeing all the respect that they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got out of office and then as</v>

1050
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.810
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely didn't think that he would</v>

1051
00:50:56.811 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 2>get all the pussy that jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1052
00:50:58.251 --> 00:51:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's a faithful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just in the,</v>

1053
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.650
<v Speaker 2>in the vein of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's nice to be offered.</v>

1054
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to know that you've got,</v>

1055
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you could possibly have the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power to shut the lights out on people,</v>

1056
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>make them disappear.</v>

1057
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 2>So he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

1058
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.220
<v Speaker 2>He could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1059
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 2>And then in those 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the world change so drastically.</v>

1060
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

1061
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 2>he see Clinton get popped with Monica</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewinsky.</v>

1062
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was step one.</v>

1063
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

1064
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I still want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1065
00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1066
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:31.370
<v Speaker 2>but Bush managers to go through and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media comes around and in the</v>

1067
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 2>midst of the social media world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when Obama steps in.</v>

1068
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.960
<v Speaker 2>So the amount of scrutiny and insults</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the amount of data that's directed</v>

1069
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:44.570
<v Speaker 2>his way as opposed to every other</v>
<v Speaker 2>president before him.</v>

1070
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.960
<v Speaker 2>There's never been a guy that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject to so many different signals of</v>

1072
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 2>negativity coming as wet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause before that people were sort of</v>

1073
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 2>voiceless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't really do anything.</v>

1074
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:01.210
<v Speaker 2>But in Obama's time blogs became a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>more prominent online news sources and</v>

1075
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 2>many people's world replaced the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the regular newsprint.</v>

1076
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just what do they talk?</v>

1077
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.880
<v Speaker 2>What are they saying to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All about me in the New York Times,</v>

1078
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:15.910
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of different blogs and it's</v>

1079
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.390
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1080
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Amazing change of events that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>rendered the position incredibly</v>

1081
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:25.430
<v Speaker 2>unattractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then eight years later,</v>

1082
00:52:25.431 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 2>this is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get crazy old Bernie sanders with</v>

1083
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.250
<v Speaker 2>his fucking wacky hairdo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Who hates money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:37.210
<v Speaker 2>You get crazy old Hillary Clinton who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrieking and she's built like a fucking</v>

1086
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 2>converse all star box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is she's,</v>

1087
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks like her body's failing.</v>

1088
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes me uncomfortable and I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

1089
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I think she's probably fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's probably in good health.</v>

1090
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I just think they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1091
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I just think she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how bad she wants it,</v>

1092
00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>but she doesn't have charisma and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if she got it,</v>

1093
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the amount of fucking stress</v>

1094
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.680
<v Speaker 2>that's involved in that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can that possibly be healthy for</v>

1095
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 2>someone who's really older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll handle it.</v>

1096
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Do you think fun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 2>If she were to get the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would handle that better than Obama</v>

1098
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:17.810
<v Speaker 2>probably had because she's been in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trenches her whole life,</v>

1099
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.793
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:24.070
<v Speaker 2>She's fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got no question that she knows how</v>

1101
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 2>to the game.</v>

1102
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a game to her and that she's trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to win.</v>

1103
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.350
<v Speaker 4>She's trying to do some nice shit for</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1104
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's trying to help people out,</v>

1105
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 4>but completely cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1106
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 4>100% I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was the secretary of state.</v>

1107
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 4>She's had people killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 4>she's ordered drone strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh a hundred percent.</v>

1109
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.890
<v Speaker 4>So we'll do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's fine.</v>

1110
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.000
<v Speaker 4>You saw her reaction to Gadhafi you saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>the news piece,</v>

1111
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.220
<v Speaker 4>what these people were talking to her</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she sits down.</v>

1112
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1113
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 4>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we saw he died.</v>

1114
00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.710
<v Speaker 4>Seen that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1116
00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1117
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.270
<v Speaker 4>You must watch it cause there a thug</v>
<v Speaker 4>life version of it too.</v>

1118
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.000
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that put up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up the fuck life version of it.</v>

1119
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 4>But it just shows you again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was she,</v>

1120
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.300
<v Speaker 4>she was a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was a lawyer and these lawyers who</v>

1121
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:17.700
<v Speaker 4>eventually become politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like to win.</v>

1122
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I just that what my physical like people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are like,</v>

1123
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you worry about her physically?</v>

1124
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.960
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I didn't explain or maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't heard.</v>

1125
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is alleged and I think it's,</v>

1126
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of been reported on that she</v>
<v Speaker 4>had blacked out and falling and hitting</v>

1127
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 4>her head recently in the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's 70 [inaudible] it's gonna happen.</v>

1128
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.890
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she had had a fairly traumatic</v>

1129
00:54:40.891 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 4>brain injury from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was something that,</v>

1130
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 4>just pull that up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

1131
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 4>See if he could find that story because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be republican bullshit.</v>

1132
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1133
00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.240
<v Speaker 4>well I'll lift relating republican</v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda also.</v>

1134
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Reagan had some brain damage and</v>

1135
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:00.330
<v Speaker 4>he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1136
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.690
<v Speaker 4>like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we don't get a president with a</v>

1137
00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:05.820
<v Speaker 4>hundred percent thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

1138
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it definitely matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at this point in time,</v>

1139
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what the Ronald Reagan thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1140
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he deteriorated as he was in</v>

1141
00:55:14.641 --> 00:55:16.650
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started off very fresh.</v>

1142
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.600
<v Speaker 4>If you go back and listen to some of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>early speeches like wrong,</v>

1143
00:55:19.601 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Reagan gave me hell of a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like tear down that wall.</v>

1144
00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had that one super bizarre speech.</v>

1146
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember this one where um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was standing in front of the United</v>

1147
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1148
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.260
<v Speaker 4>and he gave a speech about how quickly</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would all put our differences aside</v>

1149
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 4>if we were attacked by aliens from</v>
<v Speaker 4>another planet.</v>

1150
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.840
<v Speaker 4>He's 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was 100%.</v>

1151
00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 4>He is 100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it was one of the strangest</v>

1152
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking speeches ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the like.</v>

1153
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:58.010
<v Speaker 4>It is one that the Ufo lovers have clung</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like a life raft.</v>

1154
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 4>He knew it was going to tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew me.</v>

1155
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:02.634
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1156
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that Cold War that we just</v>

1157
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:09.741
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden stopped in 1989</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1158
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Work on lasers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have you seen that one,</v>

1159
00:56:13.891 --> 00:56:14.740
<v Speaker 4>that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1160
00:56:14.741 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll look that up.</v>

1161
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Did you find the Hillary won the thug</v>
<v Speaker 4>life one?</v>

1162
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 4>I found a thug life one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not sure that it's about</v>

1163
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Gadhafi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>If that's the speech,</v>

1166
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Speaker 4>she's like sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting interviewed.</v>

1167

<v Speaker 4>She fell and hit her.</v>

1170
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've found anything about that.</v>

1171
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.410
<v Speaker 4>A concussion she has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She might be suffering from post</v>

1172
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 4>concussion syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this from the inquirer?</v>

1173
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 4>This is not from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From breitbart.</v>

1174
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might as well be earlier this year.</v>

1175
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't find anything for much other</v>

1176
00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 4>and regarding that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's,</v>

1177
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 4>so I did repeat Republican propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1178
00:56:52.661 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Lisa called myself out all that.</v>

1179
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:58.030
<v Speaker 4>that is in any way.</v>

1180
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 4>Substantiated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she did have a concussion,</v>

1181
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:04.990
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know like the or she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering from it.</v>

1182

<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well load.</v>

1183
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.640
<v Speaker 4>That's when you're that old and you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>a concussion and you,</v>

1184
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>issues.</v>

1185
00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1186
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 4>what those issues are and whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're treatable.</v>

1187
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's uh,</v>

1188
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.340
<v Speaker 4>something only she would know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 4>George Bush fucking puked his guts out</v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the prime minister of Japan.</v>

1190
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 4>We also fell and blacked out and hit his</v>
<v Speaker 4>head because he choked on a pretzel no</v>

1191
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.130
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>George Bush.</v>

1192
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Old School.</v>

1193
00:57:29.261 --> 00:57:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Herbert Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1194
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when,</v>

1195
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like,</v>

1196
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 4>that was the big conspiracy because Bush</v>
<v Speaker 4>had like bruises and a black eye and</v>

1197
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:38.200
<v Speaker 4>shit and somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody beat the fuck out of the</v>

1198
00:57:38.201 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that he said he choked w with a</v>

1199
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 4>pretzel in his mouth and fell and hit</v>
<v Speaker 4>his face.</v>

1200
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was the Illuminati and I was going</v>

1201
00:57:46.101 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 4>to beat up the president at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I would make them say.</v>

1202
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to tell them that he choked</v>

1203
00:57:51.221 --> 00:57:52.054
<v Speaker 4>on a pretzel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

1205
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

1206
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 4>He blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

1207
00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 4>You fell and you hate your fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1208
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:01.180
<v Speaker 4>And then you've got this black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1209
00:58:01.181 --> 00:58:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Black Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

1210
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:06.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh</v>

1211
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the Illuminati beat up</v>

1212
00:58:08.811 --> 00:58:09.830
<v Speaker 4>George Bush?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy?</v>

1213
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I think probably Dick Cheney had him</v>

1214
00:58:13.161 --> 00:58:14.130
<v Speaker 4>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Changes.</v>

1215
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Beat the fuck out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1216
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:16.950
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck them too.</v>

1217
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1218
00:58:18.741 --> 00:58:22.400
<v Speaker 4>but that was probably tender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they got a history together.</v>

1219
00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.610
<v Speaker 4>I just have a bit about Dick Cheney</v>
<v Speaker 4>because Dick Cheney shot his friend in</v>

1220
00:58:25.611 --> 00:58:27.840
<v Speaker 4>the face and he made his friend</v>
<v Speaker 4>apologize.</v>

1221
00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:29.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no shit.</v>

1222
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:31.580
<v Speaker 4>Dick Cheney's hard fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1223
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:36.581
<v Speaker 4>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was on TV apologizing for Dick</v>

1224
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Cheney after Dick shot him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:41.690
<v Speaker 4>And he was like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he shot him in the face at 70 with a</v>

1226
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:42.563
<v Speaker 4>shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.620
<v Speaker 4>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put Hillary Clinton in Dick Cheney</v>

1228
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.410
<v Speaker 4>kind of in the same boat as like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1229
00:58:48.411 --> 00:58:50.030
<v Speaker 4>like the Henry Kiss and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1230
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 4>they'll just now just do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1231
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.070
<v Speaker 4>like if they decide someone needs to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just,</v>

1232
00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:58.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just that dictate who's a scary</v>

1233
00:58:58.611 --> 00:59:02.510
<v Speaker 4>guy and his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's also still involved.</v>

1234
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Like he still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he absolutely believes in voicing his</v>

1235
00:59:06.951 --> 00:59:10.010
<v Speaker 4>opinion and what shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be done internationally.</v>

1236
00:59:10.011 --> 00:59:11.480
<v Speaker 4>Like even now today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He's,</v>

1237
00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.190
<v Speaker 4>he scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Well he has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1239
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:20.030
<v Speaker 4>like he has to stay kind of involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know that he committed war</v>

1240
00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 4>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody that</v>

1241
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1242
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking engineered war profiteering</v>

1243
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Speaker 3>against our own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1244
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you think they'll start cheese,</v>

1245
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 3>he stays active so that he avoids</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecution by constantly staying in the</v>

1246
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>mix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1247
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 3>and George Bush did the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they both ran in separate directions.</v>

1248
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney shows up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1249
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:45.110
<v Speaker 3>we had to torture him cause we needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

1250
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good impression.</v>

1251
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:49.790
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try and then George Bush stays the fuck</v>

1252
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 3>out of it because if you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys don't travel internationally</v>

1253
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1254
00:59:54.411 --> 00:59:57.500
<v Speaker 3>that's probably a bad move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't travel internationally</v>

1255
00:59:57.501 --> 01:00:01.730
<v Speaker 3>because the jurisdiction for human</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights violations is worldwide.</v>

1256
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 3>It makes them technically hosty humanoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>Generis,</v>

1257
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:08.750
<v Speaker 3>meaning enemies of mankind at large.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just like Spain did with Pinochet,</v>

1258
01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.980
<v Speaker 3>any court can try them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just need to be able to say that</v>

1259
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 3>the courts in their home jurisdiction or</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it happened are not able to do it</v>

1260
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 3>and then they can do it.</v>

1261
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:22.040
<v Speaker 3>So whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stay here.</v>

1262
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.650
<v Speaker 3>They go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so do they have treaties with any</v>

1263
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 3>countries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is there any country that they know</v>

1264
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:29.320
<v Speaker 3>for sure won't prosecute them if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel internationally?</v>

1265
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1266
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.590
<v Speaker 3>there's country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's jurisdictions where they know</v>

1267
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.680
<v Speaker 3>won't prosecute them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can go to the UK.</v>

1268
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is the ability to</v>

1269
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:44.171
<v Speaker 3>prosecute someone for war crimes under</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Hague.</v>

1270
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because these trend,</v>

1271
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 3>these human rights violation rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

1272
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 3>all the treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they trump fucking everything except for</v>

1273
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:58.511
<v Speaker 3>a couple small technical points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a county prosecutor in Nebraska could</v>

1274
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 3>file the charges against Dick Cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1275
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.880
<v Speaker 3>And although that might violate United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States law and they might say you have</v>

1276
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:12.200
<v Speaker 3>to do it here or here or here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no technique.</v>

1277
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:17.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean basically like so any</v>
<v Speaker 3>enterprising prosecutor in Spain,</v>

1278
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.130
<v Speaker 3>if they could lay their hands on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can do them.</v>

1279
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Any body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any process you.</v>

1280
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 3>So depending on the way that the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizes its prosecution system,</v>

1281
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 3>the lowest level person competent to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make the decision could potentially try</v>

1282
01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 3>to jack a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1283
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:39.220
<v Speaker 3>So like I know I'm saying like his level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of travel has to be so well coordinated</v>

1284
01:01:39.471 --> 01:01:42.620
<v Speaker 3>because fucking county sheriff could</v>
<v Speaker 3>take him in for this shit.</v>

1285
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wrong county sheriff could pick him</v>

1286
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:47.750
<v Speaker 3>up on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has anybody ever tried to do that?</v>

1287
01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.190
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1288
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know</v>

1289
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:57.350
<v Speaker 3>why they don't travel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they fact that nobody's ever</v>

1290
01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 3>even tried to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the evidence is overwhelming and</v>

1291
01:02:00.771 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 3>clear that Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1292
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the Guy who authored the report</v>

1293
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.420
<v Speaker 3>saying that torture was okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1294
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.170
<v Speaker 3>That itself is a violation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>international law for which you can be</v>

1295
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:13.004
<v Speaker 3>prosecuted.</v>

1296
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1297
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just,</v>

1298
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.640
<v Speaker 3>that's the tip of the iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that guy can't,</v>

1299
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 3>because when if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they can travel a little bit,</v>

1300
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 3>but there's countries they can't go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they'll snap him up and</v>

1301
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 3>prosecute him because yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These just,</v>

1302
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 3>I forget exactly what I'm talking like</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to explain.</v>

1303
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Anyone can prosecute him for any of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1304
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has the proof and when he goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to other countries,</v>

1305
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:47.890
<v Speaker 3>they will use the fact that we have not</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecuted him here as proof that we're</v>

1306
01:02:47.891 --> 01:02:50.710
<v Speaker 3>not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will allow them to go forward.</v>

1307
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.190
<v Speaker 4>So all it would take would be like say</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he decides to make a trip to,</v>

1308
01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:57.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1309
01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:00.390
<v Speaker 4>Some European country yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All would take is one ambitious person.</v>

1310
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened to Pinochet</v>

1311
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 4>and that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a decade long fight.</v>

1312
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.630
<v Speaker 4>That's why a so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1313
01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.250
<v Speaker 4>That's why Paul Pot never left Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1314
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.590
<v Speaker 4>it's so also so fascinating that we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>these weird rules that the presidents</v>

1315
01:03:16.591 --> 01:03:17.310
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1316
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Like we're a presence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can get away with certain things,</v>

1317
01:03:19.051 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 4>like they can admonish people or they</v>
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>

1318
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:22.051
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather,</v>

1319
01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:22.884
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1320
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:25.280
<v Speaker 4>release people from jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1321
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Speaker 4>They can suspend their senses</v>

1322
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.540
<v Speaker 3>for federal offenses and governors can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it for state offenses.</v>

1323
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to have a release valve on some</v>

1324
01:03:35.801 --> 01:03:39.130
<v Speaker 3>shit and they use it like Bill Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it for a lot of political feminist</v>

1325
01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.530
<v Speaker 3>pardons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The get as many as you want.</v>

1326
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Wides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1327
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:46.050
<v Speaker 4>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get someone out like for a</v>

1328
01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:47.940
<v Speaker 4>violent crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1329
01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:52.150
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on the jurisdiction,</v>

1330
01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.440
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Wisconsin,</v>

1331
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.680
<v Speaker 3>there is no functional limit on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>power of the governor to let you out.</v>

1332
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or pardon you,</v>

1333
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.440
<v Speaker 3>cause there's no limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the governor and other governors</v>

1334
01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:10.441
<v Speaker 3>before of him if instituted a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>boards that we'll review requests for</v>

1335
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:13.420
<v Speaker 3>clemencies and pardons and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1336
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.390
<v Speaker 3>And they have ad hoc rules where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1337
01:04:16.391 --> 01:04:18.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be at least five years ago.</v>

1338
01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:19.660
<v Speaker 3>You've got to show us this and this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1339
01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:23.170
<v Speaker 3>But in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could do whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

1340
01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:25.060
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's the executive.</v>

1341
01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>county sheriffs also have the ability to</v>

1342
01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:29.800
<v Speaker 3>release people from jail.</v>

1343
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1344
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Because they run the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sentence only says that you should be</v>

1345
01:04:36.351 --> 01:04:41.351
<v Speaker 3>confined for this for x amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the governors in charge of the</v>

1346
01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Department of corrections so he can let</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out early if he feels like it.</v>

1347
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.360
<v Speaker 3>And County sheriff is in charge of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>jail and if county sheriff needs the</v>

1348
01:04:50.361 --> 01:04:51.440
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can kick out.</v>

1349
01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:53.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what he did with Paris Hilton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1350
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I need the bed for somebody else get up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can do that.</v>

1351
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.470
<v Speaker 3>There are some minor checks on it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutors get really mad.</v>

1352
01:05:00.471 --> 01:05:02.240
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1353
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.040
<v Speaker 3>they have almost unlimited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost free reign in the area of</v>

1354
01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:09.060
<v Speaker 3>pardons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like some King Shit.</v>

1355
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.240
<v Speaker 3>It is King Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1356
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>That is what kings can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the power of life and death.</v>

1357
01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 5>The strange thing to give someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1358
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so weird that that still exists.</v>

1359
01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.740
<v Speaker 5>It has to exist because you cannot trust</v>
<v Speaker 5>the courts to do fairness.</v>

1360
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.640
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.300
<v Speaker 5>But you can trust the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Courts are good for technical points.</v>

1362
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But every now and again there's a guy</v>

1363
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.200
<v Speaker 5>and he's in and the courts won't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the governor has got to be able to</v>

1364
01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:39.390
<v Speaker 5>let them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1365
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like it opens a door for a lot</v>

1366
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:44.590
<v Speaker 5>of fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It no,</v>

1367
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 5>because everybody's looking like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't pardon someone without anybody,</v>

1368
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 5>without everybody knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1369
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:53.470
<v Speaker 5>But on a offense case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when you're sitting on the</v>

1370
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:54.510
<v Speaker 5>fence on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they're,</v>

1371
01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:55.950
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to influence someone</v>

1372
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 5>one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1373
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.030
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nixon got,</v>

1374
01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 5>pardon teddy really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who pardoned Nixon,</v>

1375
01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:05.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Clinton pardoned his own brother,</v>

1376
01:06:05.771 --> 01:06:06.604
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1377
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1378
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:10.360
<v Speaker 5>You can just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1384
01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:32.140

1391
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 5>different prosecutors across the globe</v>
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>

1392
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:52.960
<v Speaker 5>they can do it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>was pardoned by Ford and that's what led</v>
<v Speaker 4>to him not getting reelected.</v>

1474
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 2>It was from</v>
<v Speaker 2>something Gonzo and Hollywood or</v>

1495
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a documentary that they did.</v>

1496
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 2>This should probably be a clip of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

1497
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:34.820
<v Speaker 3>My family hated Richard Nixon growing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when Richard Nixon came to</v>

1498
01:11:34.821 --> 01:11:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin rapids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather arranged for a cadillac</v>

1499
01:11:38.931 --> 01:11:43.931
<v Speaker 3>for him as he got off the plane and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>address the people he stood on the</v>

1500
01:11:44.061 --> 01:11:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Cadillac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scratch the hood with his shoes and</v>

1501
01:11:46.851 --> 01:11:48.800
<v Speaker 3>refuse to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1502
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:52.370
<v Speaker 3>That was so not anything about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spying.</v>

1503
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:55.580
<v Speaker 3>That was not my family's problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard Nixon.</v>

1504
01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.830
<v Speaker 3>It was that he scratched the hood of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cadillac.</v>

1505
01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Well that was a piece of shit move.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Still haven't found it.</v>

1525
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I got a picture of Bill Murray with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thompson and the Nixon thing,</v>

1526
01:12:48.071 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 3>but nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1528
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:54.160
<v Speaker 2>wish I could remember the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual name of the documentary,</v>

1529
01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but it was a BBC documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>

1530
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.140
<v Speaker 2>They did on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting stuff.</v>

1531
01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.390
<v Speaker 2>And part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked to one of the guys who</v>

1532
01:13:01.391 --> 01:13:06.391
<v Speaker 2>testified against Nixon and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was like in deep,</v>

1533
01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:11.150
<v Speaker 2>deep trouble before the tapes came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the tapes came out and,</v>

1534
01:13:11.151 --> 01:13:14.050
<v Speaker 2>and exonerated him and prove that what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was saying was true.</v>

1535
01:13:14.051 --> 01:13:16.030
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred was talking to him and</v>

1538
01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:25.210
<v Speaker 2>sinister and what the government was</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing like in many ways had</v>

1539
01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:26.450
<v Speaker 2>been sort of Defang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1541
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1542
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.650
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't break,</v>

1543
01:13:31.651 --> 01:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>they can't get away with as much easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1544
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they don't have fangs,</v>

1545
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:37.190
<v Speaker 3>but now they have tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1546
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a Japanese sit monster</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1547
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.970
<v Speaker 3>like drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things along the long,</v>

1548
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 3>they have drones and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know they have facebook.</v>

1549
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they can create 11,000 fake profiles</v>

1550
01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 3>on facebook and send out friend requests</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now they know where everybody is.</v>

1551
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Who's got their shit marked public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1552
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.270
<v Speaker 3>they know when you're in the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know when you're at Burger King of</v>

1553
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:04.530
<v Speaker 3>they're really looking out for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1554
01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll do really fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1555
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of this data is bullshit</v>

1556
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 3>that they can never use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1557
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>but they're accumulating it cause</v>

1558
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.090
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1559
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 5>they're like Marma sets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you ever see Marma sets at the</v>

1560
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.700
<v Speaker 5>zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put something colorful up against the</v>

1561
01:14:18.701 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 5>glass and you got their attention and</v>
<v Speaker 5>our personal details,</v>

1562
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 5>although completely fucking worthless</v>
<v Speaker 5>and useless and boring.</v>

1563
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they want that shit.</v>

1564
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:32.500
<v Speaker 5>They want to know who we're calling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're obsessed with that stuff because</v>

1565
01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 5>they're curious because there are people</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so they collect it thinking we might</v>

1566
01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:39.280
<v Speaker 5>get a use for this or we might figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out that somebody is a terrorist and</v>

1567
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 5>then we'll get everybody the day call</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they hang on to all this other</v>

1568
01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause that might be useful to,</v>

1569
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 5>they're just hoarders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're creepy hoarders.</v>

1570
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.900
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's under the guise that one day</v>

1571
01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:51.460
<v Speaker 5>you might commit a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:54.250
<v Speaker 5>One day we might need this so we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna keep this.</v>

1573
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 5>That's what a hoarder things.</v>

1574
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.720
<v Speaker 5>Well it's not really just hoarding cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1575
01:14:58.721 --> 01:15:00.670
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hoarding other people's stuff.</v>

1576
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really is other people's</v>

1577
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.470
<v Speaker 5>personal data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we haven't really,</v>

1578
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.480
<v Speaker 5>we haven't really made the concession</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if I use email or if I make phone</v>

1579
01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 5>calls or if I sent texts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government has all this,</v>

1580
01:15:13.271 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 5>we haven't made that concession.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.831
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1582
01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:16.810
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to be a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is reality.</v>

1583
01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But no one has agreed to that yet.</v>

1584
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 5>And they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1585
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 5>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Need it for freedom at well.</v>

1586
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.440
<v Speaker 5>And every time something like that goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>to court in an actual court as opposed</v>

1587
01:15:28.511 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 5>to their Pfizer courts where we're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>even allowed to know what they're asking</v>

1588
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they go in regular court,</v>

1589
01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 5>they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then they just go and do it in a</v>

1590
01:15:36.851 --> 01:15:38.950
<v Speaker 5>secret court that lets them do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck they want.</v>

1591
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 5>We'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know how many times terrorist</v>

1592
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:46.891
<v Speaker 5>attacks have been stopped by a tapping</v>
<v Speaker 5>into people's phones and reviewing</v>

1593
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.300
<v Speaker 5>people's emails?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to guess is zero.</v>

1594
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 5>I would say zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1595
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna go with zero.</v>

1596
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:57.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what they like to do?</v>

1597
01:15:57.731 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 5>That's adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They like to create terror scenarios.</v>

1598
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 5>Can we pay attention to those when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk a guy in the blowing something up,</v>

1599
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 5>give him a bomb on a rest and when he</v>
<v Speaker 5>tries to detonate the bomb because the</v>

1600
01:16:06.701 --> 01:16:08.080
<v Speaker 5>bomb wasn't real in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1601
01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 5>They used to do that to black panthers</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody in the sixties and</v>

1602
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.990
<v Speaker 5>seventies well they used to love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1603
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:17.290
<v Speaker 5>And that was another thing that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>learned about the Nixon administration</v>

1604
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:21.690
<v Speaker 5>with the terms of the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement and in terms of the antiwar</v>

1605
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.301
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1606
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the,</v>

1607
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.180
<v Speaker 5>this is the actual video itself.</v>

<v Speaker 4>runaway success.</v>

1615
01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:02.740
<v Speaker 4>Total attendance of three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the voice.</v>

1616
01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't forgive him.</v>

1617
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 4>And why</v>

1618
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.710
<v Speaker 8>did it change your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1619
01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.450
<v Speaker 8>your speech,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the excitement.</v>

1620
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:16.670
<v Speaker 8>I'm wearing that shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everything surrounding my mind is being</v>

1621
01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 8>changed tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Serious dude.</v>

1622
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.970
<v Speaker 8>Seriously.</v>

1623
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.610
<v Speaker 3>The scientologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were watching that they're going</v>

1624
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.090
<v Speaker 3>fuck wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could've got that guy.</v>

1625
01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:27.760
<v Speaker 3>We kind of got that guy now Nixon's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>him shit.</v>

1626
01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.860
<v Speaker 3>So that was what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1978 yeah.</v>

1627
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's many years after Watergate.</v>

1628
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.910
<v Speaker 3>Well they can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this whole email thing,</v>

1630
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 3>the Clinton email thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1631
01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:47.270
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bizarre.</v>

1632
01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 3>That's a bizarre one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what their problem is?</v>

1633
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:55.490
<v Speaker 3>What they did Whitewater and like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clintons beat him at Whitewater.</v>

1634
01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though he fucking pardoned people</v>

1635
01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>that worked for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did time,</v>

1636
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:04.580
<v Speaker 3>they beat Whitewater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Whitewater was,</v>

1637
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think it's Watergate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1638
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.690
<v Speaker 3>When you're a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in government,</v>

1639
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.900
<v Speaker 3>you're privy to some things about where</v>
<v Speaker 3>roads might go or where electricity</v>

1640
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 3>might be routed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just get information and if you do</v>

1641
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 3>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could make real estate investments.</v>

1642
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:30.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't profit from stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be wrong.</v>

1643
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 3>But what if your wife was a consultant?</v>

1644
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.880
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

1645
01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:40.570
<v Speaker 3>that's not exactly how Whitewater went</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

1646
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:45.630
<v Speaker 3>but that is how most of the corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians that you see operate,</v>

1647
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:51.870
<v Speaker 3>their wives have bullshit jobs and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bribes are funneled in through that in</v>

1648
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.890
<v Speaker 3>substantial part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it could be a green lighting</v>

1649
01:18:56.891 --> 01:18:58.540
<v Speaker 3>something or it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1650
01:18:58.541 --> 01:19:01.320
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just a real estate scandal and it</v>

1651
01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:05.140
<v Speaker 3>was probably just real estate</v>
<v Speaker 3>investments that went bad and their</v>

1652
01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:08.140
<v Speaker 3>books probably we're not in order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they had to keep their mouth</v>

1653
01:19:08.141 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 3>shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably weren't really fucking</v>

1654
01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:10.990
<v Speaker 3>around that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1655
01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:15.040
<v Speaker 3>What's really fascinating know there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that's more obvious and more blatant</v>

1656
01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.980
<v Speaker 3>that no one bats an eye on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the Dick Cheney Halliburton</v>

1657
01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:18.850
<v Speaker 3>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1658
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not family and it's not</v>

1659
01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:23.530
<v Speaker 3>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at the fact that this</v>

1660
01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:26.590
<v Speaker 3>guy was a ceo of Halliburton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then how Britain gets these no bid</v>

1661
01:19:26.591 --> 01:19:31.591
<v Speaker 3>contracts for billions of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>elected officials are supposed to suck,</v>

1662
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of sequester their assets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trusts a blind trusts so that they don't</v>

1663
01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:43.390
<v Speaker 3>really know if they're benefiting their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ownership interest in Halliburton or</v>

1664
01:19:43.391 --> 01:19:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Kellogg Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1665
01:19:45.610 --> 01:19:47.290
<v Speaker 3>it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>

1666
01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:49.450
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to just pretend like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't own it,</v>

1667
01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:54.780
<v Speaker 3>and if you put it on paper in a blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust meant to benefit you and your</v>

1668
01:19:55.061 --> 01:19:57.400
<v Speaker 3>assigns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you technically no longer own it.</v>

1669
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>

1670
01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.870
<v Speaker 3>let's just be like the most optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1671
01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:05.380
<v Speaker 3>Let's say Dick Cheney didn't profit from</v>
<v Speaker 3>how Burton having all these no bid</v>

1672
01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:07.950
<v Speaker 3>contracts and he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's hooked up a buddy.</v>

1673
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way it's these,</v>

1675
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:11.820
<v Speaker 2>he used to work there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1676
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:16.850
<v Speaker 2>He used to be the CEO and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he hooked him up with selling $48</v>

1677
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.650
<v Speaker 2>cases of soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>48 bucks.</v>

1678
01:20:19.770 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would cost a lot of money to get soda</v>

1679
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 2>to Iraq in his defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1680
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:26.530
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not get it.</v>

1681
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Put It on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to hire someone to carry it.</v>

1682
01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for that they could have built a</v>

1683
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 2>fucking Coca Cola plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 2>But you don't want to cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriation,</v>

1685
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go over there.</v>

1686
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super bad.</v>

1687
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Now that's over there with Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's colonialism.</v>

1688
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's technically called.</v>

1689
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:47.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing that they pulled that off</v>

1690
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.130
<v Speaker 2>and that's not under investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Whitewater,</v>

1691
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.580
<v Speaker 2>fucked up real estate venture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Like 4 million bucks worth of real</v>
<v Speaker 2>estate versus owl.</v>

1694
01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Know $1 trillion that may be incentive</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to war.</v>

1695
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do certain actions that caused massive</v>

1696
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 2>loss of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>

1697
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean they thought they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win and make a nice chunk of change.</v>

1698
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:13.350
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit spun out of control and they ended</v>

1699
01:21:13.351 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 2>up making a lot of money and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1700
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the movie going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to vet evidently,</v>

1701
01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 2>evidently eventually watch like there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a movie in maybe 10 or 15</v>

1702
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:30.381
<v Speaker 2>years where it shows the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the madness that was the original Iraq</v>

1703
01:21:31.411 --> 01:21:35.340
<v Speaker 2>war and the call to all these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was weapons of mass</v>

1704
01:21:35.341 --> 01:21:39.500
<v Speaker 2>destruction and people a testifying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and then realizing it was bullshit.</v>

1705
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the chaos involved and all the the</v>

1706
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.530
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone's going to do a bad ass</v>

1707
01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:46.830
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1708
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll put tune Oliver Stone style</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie about that war.</v>

1709
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.613
<v Speaker 2>It's common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1710
01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

1711
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've done the hurt locker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They done zero dark 30.</v>

1712
01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>They did a Tina fey one in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1713
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Tina fey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 2>the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.520

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:11.640

<v Speaker 2>Foxtrot.</v>

1718
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Is it been out yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just came out a couple of months ago.</v>

1719
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.160
<v Speaker 2>There's too many movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is there.</v>

1720
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:20.910
<v Speaker 2>There are literally too many movies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch because they don't stop making</v>

1721
01:22:20.911 --> 01:22:23.400
<v Speaker 2>movies and you can never watch all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies that have already been made.</v>

1722
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:25.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's like being in debt but still</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying shit.</v>

1723
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.660
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're going to catch up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the great movies.</v>

1724
01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:29.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch all the superhero movies</v>

1725
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many of them.</v>

1726
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm done.</v>

1727
01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:35.670
<v Speaker 2>They just too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're too obvious.</v>

1728
01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want more watchmen.</v>

1729
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1730
01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:43.380
<v Speaker 2>that was a real fucking superhero movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a great movie that I want</v>

1731
01:22:43.381 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 2>more of those come on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.610
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the last time I saw a</v>

1734
01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:54.420
<v Speaker 2>superhero movie that felt like it grew</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with me.</v>

1735
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you read it before?</v>

1736
01:22:57.571 --> 01:22:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Did you know anything about it but</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing new.</v>

1737
01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Nothing helps that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe it would be disappointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had read the stuff.</v>

1739
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.260
<v Speaker 2>They think they're fucking up your,</v>

1740
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:10.930
<v Speaker 4>that is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem if you're a hardcore</v>

1741
01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 4>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember in squad looks interesting</v>

1742
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 4>cause I've never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read that shit.</v>

1743
01:23:14.681 --> 01:23:16.900
<v Speaker 4>But it's cool to see a bunch of villains</v>
<v Speaker 4>get together and,</v>

1744
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.970
<v Speaker 4>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen him do.</v>

1745
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:20.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be cool.</v>

1746
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:21.700
<v Speaker 4>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks really fascinating.</v>

1747
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.400
<v Speaker 4>It looks like what's going to be really</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark and creepy and should maybe be fun.</v>

1748
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.620
<v Speaker 4>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be something like that</v>

1749
01:23:27.621 --> 01:23:28.250
<v Speaker 4>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1750
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:31.210
<v Speaker 4>but I think watchman's my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 4>superhero movie I think.</v>

1751
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:34.180
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's yours?</v>

1752
01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:37.660
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to remember like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember when I saw the avengers the</v>

1753
01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:38.494
<v Speaker 4>first one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1754
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:40.930
<v Speaker 4>A couple of years ago when I first came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out and they'd fucked up New York and</v>

1755
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:43.700
<v Speaker 4>everyone looked like that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it also could have been,</v>

1756
01:23:43.701 --> 01:23:47.380
<v Speaker 4>it was the first time we saw the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conglomeration of all the superheroes</v>

1757
01:23:47.381 --> 01:23:48.040
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1758
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.740
<v Speaker 4>I could go back and watch it now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably have different thoughts on</v>

1759
01:23:50.741 --> 01:23:51.101
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1760
01:23:51.101 --> 01:23:52.660
<v Speaker 4>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you do another one,</v>

1761
01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:53.950
<v Speaker 4>what we already know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get together,</v>

1762
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 4>like the whole charm of them getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>together for the first time it's been</v>

1763
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 4>worn off and how you're going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hook to listen to you get the fuck out</v>

1764
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:01.503
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1765
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.550
<v Speaker 4>I didn't buy any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1766
01:24:03.551 --> 01:24:06.190
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why he left.</v>

1767
01:24:06.191 --> 01:24:07.260
<v Speaker 4>He's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

1768
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 4>You can't find them now that he was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>best Hawk though that dude.</v>

1769
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.310
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1770
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.020
<v Speaker 4>that's the best talk movie I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1771
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1772
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:17.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 4>He was full on bill bixby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Mark Ravello is a bad ass act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

1775
01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:25.570
<v Speaker 4>I believe that he was smart enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>create the kind of,</v>

1776
01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions that would lead to him being</v>

1777
01:24:27.701 --> 01:24:28.170
<v Speaker 4>the hulk</v>

1778
01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:29.940
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he plays it like,</v>

1779
01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:33.930
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like a guy,</v>

1780
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:37.320
<v Speaker 3>like when Eric Bond and Norton did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1781
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.740
<v Speaker 3>they kind of missed the point of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're,</v>

1782
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a guy who turns into the Hawk</v>

1783
01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:44.490
<v Speaker 3>like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking sick of it.</v>

1784
01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not cool anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1785
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:49.080
<v Speaker 3>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God fucking dammit.</v>

1786
01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:50.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm the fucking hall could like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1787
01:24:50.821 --> 01:24:52.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like being an alcoholic,</v>

1788
01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:55.020
<v Speaker 3>like blacking out and waking up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tijuana.</v>

1789
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.840
<v Speaker 3>That's the hulks life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he asked to move on.</v>

1790
01:24:57.841 --> 01:25:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Like it's frustrating and like he played</v>
<v Speaker 3>that frustration really well.</v>

1791
01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:05.730
<v Speaker 4>You know what the number one problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all of the hulk movies and all the</v>

1792
01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:09.060
<v Speaker 4>whole comic books are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one problem is pants.</v>

1793
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:09.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1794
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:12.180
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Those pants would not survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so much bigger.</v>

1796
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:16.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then Mark Rufallo.</v>

1797
01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:19.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those pants stretched to fit his</v>

1798
01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.220
<v Speaker 4>gigantic ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just huge thighs.</v>

1799
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the shirts off a related story to</v>

1800
01:25:26.731 --> 01:25:28.890
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just typed in the hawk on Google.</v>

1801
01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:33.150
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to fight isis.</v>

1802
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 4>He looks like the hug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1803
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:38.900
<v Speaker 4>this guy's going to fight isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks like a gorilla.</v>

1804
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:40.380
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the hairiest guy.</v>

1805
01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.560
<v Speaker 4>Is he a Persian Hawk man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy was huge.</v>

1806
01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.800
<v Speaker 4>He wants to fight isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does he know they have guns?</v>

1807
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Giant 24 stone bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much that is.</v>

1808
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:53.400
<v Speaker 4>I think a stone is 13 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>

1809
01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Google?</v>

1810
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>24 how the fuck did you get that big at</v>

1811
01:25:57.421 --> 01:25:59.460
<v Speaker 4>24 hello?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long.</v>

1812
01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The giant man with a fierce as a cult</v>

1813
01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 4>following on instagram where he posts</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he does best.</v>

1814
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just a guy that wants attention</v>

1815
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.820
<v Speaker 4>and they're giving him attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so silly.</v>

1816
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.620
<v Speaker 4>He's got a stick his head back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>flexes traps and that's how he's going</v>

1817
01:26:17.621 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 4>to fight isis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's going to work.</v>

1818
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could probably throw tennis balls</v>

1819
01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Speaker 4>hard enough to kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably throw like five pound weights.</v>

1820
01:26:25.461 --> 01:26:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he'd kill anybody with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tennis ball,</v>

1821
01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.900
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe like choke them.</v>

1822
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you get it right in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth,</v>

1823
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:36.270
<v Speaker 4>even if you get it right in their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to hold it in there.</v>

1824
01:26:36.271 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 4>I take them breathe through their nose.</v>

1825
01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to like cover their</v>

1826
01:26:39.351 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 4>nose and that would be what kills him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

1827
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.950
<v Speaker 4>I have to rework my plan to kill a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people because they,</v>

1828
01:26:44.951 --> 01:26:47.110
<v Speaker 4>it involve tennis balls and I realize</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not gonna work.</v>

1829
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to work,</v>

1830
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.390
<v Speaker 4>but you can get fucked up by the tennis</v>
<v Speaker 4>ball.</v>

1831
01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:54.140
<v Speaker 4>You'd probably get some nice cte from a</v>
<v Speaker 4>head shot to the temple,</v>

1832
01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 4>but like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1833
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.010
<v Speaker 4>tennis machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it serves American gladiator.</v>

1834
01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Blop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blop like if you see how fast one of</v>

1835
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:03.760
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1852
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Can hit off of a solid piece of metal</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of just some strings.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 4>official to 37</v>

1867
01:28:19.551 --> 01:28:20.890

<v Speaker 4>That guy had some ass in that shot to</v>

1869
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>show that again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll call the ass that guy.</v>

1870
01:28:26.781 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten that shot and maybe that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the secret.</v>

1871
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody else works out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders and he's just like,</v>

1872
01:28:31.071 --> 01:28:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Nah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all in.</v>

1873
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 4>Well he's a big dude too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like with his thighs.</v>

1874
01:28:35.091 --> 01:28:36.170
<v Speaker 4>And all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but watch this,</v>

1875
01:28:36.171 --> 01:28:41.171
<v Speaker 4>watch this way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put that ass in there so it spin.</v>

1876
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Tiger's back is all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even play it now because</v>

1877
01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:46.160
<v Speaker 4>there's all the torque he's put on his</v>
<v Speaker 4>back over the years.</v>

1878
01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:48.550
<v Speaker 4>Really through all his powers come from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1879
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 4>they said that his stance and his stroke</v>
<v Speaker 4>were unconventional.</v>

1880
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.490
<v Speaker 4>So in the unconventional stance and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stroke,</v>

1881
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this is true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but did that put any pressure whatsoever</v>

1882
01:28:58.671 --> 01:29:01.000
<v Speaker 4>on his spine in some weird way to that?</v>

1883
01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Yet the amount of twist he was killing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ball.</v>

1884
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he also may have,</v>

1885
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:07.320
<v Speaker 4>may or may not have been canceling</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1886
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know as doctors,</v>

1887
01:29:09.841 --> 01:29:12.810
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they testing him?</v>

1888

<v Speaker 4>the top 10 earners the other day for,</v>

1893
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:30.450
<v Speaker 4>sport to the amount of money they make</v>
<v Speaker 4>from endorsements that three of the top</v>

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Mcelroy homeboy.</v>

1952
01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've never heard of him.</v>

1953
01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 4>If you heard of Mcelroy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No I have no.</v>

1954
01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:53.430
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Homeboy made $35 million.</v>

1955
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:55.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and endorsements.</v>

1956
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Golf is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What another game?</v>

1957
01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.610
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how many rich people</v>
<v Speaker 4>have attached themselves to that.</v>

1958
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.570
<v Speaker 4>What's the dumbest sport that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>made a lot of money and curling</v>

1959
01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.240
<v Speaker 4>endorsement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much you think they make curly?</v>

1960
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look for the top curler.</v>

1961
01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:08.410
<v Speaker 4>Crows getting mad when you bring this</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1962
01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:10.750
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of people in Canada got</v>

1963
01:32:10.751 --> 01:32:13.000
<v Speaker 4>really pissed at me for talking shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>about curling.</v>

1964
01:32:13.530 --> 01:32:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Think I actually got pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not unironically auto racing.</v>

1965
01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.050
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty bad ass though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Well earnhardt you'd think earnhardt</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be cleaning up way more than</v>

1967
01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 4>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Formula One.</v>

1968
01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>auto racing is amazing.</v>

1969
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to me is one of the craziest things</v>

1970
01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 4>to dedicate your life to those formula</v>
<v Speaker 4>one guys.</v>

1971
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:38.040
<v Speaker 4>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

1972
01:32:38.041 --> 01:32:39.970
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting how that doesn't really</v>

1973
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 4>fly over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1974
01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.310
<v Speaker 4>but yet we do like fast cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why don't we like Nascar but we</v>

1975
01:32:45.311 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 4>don't like Formula One.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1976
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I think NASCAR,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I didn't ask our start from a</v>

1977
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:53.910
<v Speaker 4>bootlegging races.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1978
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:57.100
<v Speaker 4>So that's pretty fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty cool.</v>

1979
01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 4>Pretty dope actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a formula one doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of fucking backstory.</v>

1981
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like these to have to have a trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas Formula One is just like really</v>

1982
01:33:05.951 --> 01:33:09.940
<v Speaker 4>a race car and Nascar vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to be able to store whiskey and</v>

1983
01:33:09.941 --> 01:33:11.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're avoiding the fas.</v>

1984
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:13.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1985
01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:16.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think the beauty of that is kind</v>

1986
01:33:16.051 --> 01:33:20.380
<v Speaker 4>of like for Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sorta has to be a car that you could</v>

1987
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:21.640
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1988
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 4>like it's gotta be based on a car that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of us could get.</v>

1989
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1990
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:28.990
<v Speaker 4>like when somebody just fucking crushing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a chevy.</v>

1991
01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:29.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Whereas opposed to when somebody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a goddamn 14 foot needle.</v>

1993
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:35.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

1994
01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 4>he's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.230
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy sitting in the cockpit which is</v>

1996
01:33:41.231 --> 01:33:43.620
<v Speaker 4>in the center and he's exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1998
01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:48.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ayrton Senna videos of him when he was</v>

1999
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.480
<v Speaker 4>at the top of the heap in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in racing and watching from his</v>

2000
01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you ever seen some of those</v>

2001
01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:55.870
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2002
01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you see the video from a</v>

2003
01:33:59.021 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 4>perspective of a person actually driving</v>
<v Speaker 4>the car,</v>

2004
01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.440
<v Speaker 4>it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2005
01:34:03.441 --> 01:34:06.100
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing what a us,</v>

2006
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.920
<v Speaker 4>a fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane experience.</v>

2007
01:34:08.921 --> 01:34:13.921
<v Speaker 4>It is to be in a formula one car and</v>
<v Speaker 4>make those turns like that to me is one</v>

2008
01:34:14.411 --> 01:34:17.710
<v Speaker 4>of the most exciting things to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of sports because they are just,</v>

2009
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 4>especially if you could look at it from</v>
<v Speaker 4>their point of view,</v>

2010
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're grabbing the cushions of the</v>

2011
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:22.871
<v Speaker 4>couch going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2012
01:34:22.871 --> 01:34:23.231
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2013
01:34:23.231 --> 01:34:23.800
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

2014
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause they're making these split second</v>

2015
01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:28.930
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to take these tight turns or</v>

2016
01:34:28.931 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 4>avoiding people around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to cut corners.</v>

2017
01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Like look at this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this fucking car.</v>

2018
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:36.063
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this.</v>

2019
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Now we're watching this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2020
01:34:40.630 --> 01:34:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the name of this video?</v>

2021
01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 4>It says a first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I level camera.</v>

2022
01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Formula One.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is probably what I've seen online.</v>

2023
01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this looks like so much God damn fun.</v>

2024
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's fucking in this thing</v>

2025
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't have a windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2026
01:35:00.730 --> 01:35:05.210
<v Speaker 2>this little tiny windshield that's about</v>
<v Speaker 2>six inches long or six inches high</v>

2027
01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's got just goggles on and a face</v>

2028
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:14.051
<v Speaker 2>mask and the whole deal and a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's essentially exposed in this</v>

2029
01:35:14.811 --> 01:35:19.160
<v Speaker 2>super rocket ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a controlled explosion going on</v>

2030
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:23.120
<v Speaker 2>flying around this track with amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds.</v>

2031
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:26.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just</v>

2032
01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.040
<v Speaker 2>says they'd do up to five g's and Nascar</v>
<v Speaker 2>get up,</v>

2033
01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:32.580
<v Speaker 2>gets up to only to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2034
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2035
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 2>five Jesus is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably have to have an insanely</v>

2036
01:35:38.571 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 2>strong neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2037
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 2>well I think your head's stuck in place</v>
<v Speaker 2>by some gadget now.</v>

2038
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean it definitely is in a nascar</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people got really</v>

2039
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:48.650
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2040
01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Little correction there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

2041
01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:53.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a quick move with the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who the ass and kicked out a little</v>

2042
01:35:53.751 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 2>bit on them dude.</v>

2043
01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Then fucking knobs on that car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>

2044
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:59.740
<v Speaker 2>donate what those buttons do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2045
01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:00.191
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2046
01:36:00.191 --> 01:36:02.990
<v Speaker 2>it is the green number two knob do well</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2047
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 2>well those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those lights that go across,</v>

2048
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:09.500
<v Speaker 2>those are indicating the rpms cause they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have those in some cars.</v>

2049
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 2>So when you see his light go and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from green,</v>

2050
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:14.430
<v Speaker 2>like before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see it in better,</v>

2051
01:36:14.431 --> 01:36:15.264
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>

2052
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:21.370
<v Speaker 2>But he has like see there those lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like to let him know most likely</v>

2053
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:24.980
<v Speaker 2>what is our rpms are at and when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's in danger of blowing his</v>

2054
01:36:24.981 --> 01:36:28.070
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if these guys have</v>

2055
01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.910
<v Speaker 2>regulators on their engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay.</v>

2056
01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:33.290
<v Speaker 5>This is probably stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Car people are going crazy cause like,</v>

2057
01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you buy a new car today,</v>

2058
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:39.840
<v Speaker 5>they have rev limiters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'll get to a certain rpm is where</v>

2059
01:36:39.841 --> 01:36:42.720
<v Speaker 5>you could fucking torture engine and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll back you off.</v>

2060
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 5>God Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that looks fun though.</v>

2061
01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.830
<v Speaker 5>I get excited just watching that</v>
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline.</v>

2062
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thrill of the chase and what else?</v>

2063
01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:53.543
<v Speaker 5>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike Schmidt.</v>

2064
01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.870
<v Speaker 5>Victory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Victory.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:58.050
<v Speaker 5>So you did this for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2067
01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.120
<v Speaker 5>And then a decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this,</v>

2068
01:37:00.121 --> 01:37:02.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah Yeah.</v>

2069
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:05.610
<v Speaker 5>Well I was doing that on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at one point I was like,</v>

2070
01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.473
<v Speaker 5>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2071
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:09.300
<v Speaker 5>they're never going to listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I guess I'm just going to go to tell</v>

2072
01:37:09.301 --> 01:37:10.590
<v Speaker 5>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2073
01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 5>So you tried to enact some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>reform or you tried to at least say what</v>

2074
01:37:14.701 --> 01:37:15.390
<v Speaker 5>the fuck's going on?</v>

2075
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:16.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2076
01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:20.160
<v Speaker 5>they don't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you bring any of this up in your</v>

2077
01:37:20.161 --> 01:37:21.450
<v Speaker 5>act?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2078
01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.440
<v Speaker 5>Now because it's really depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:27.203
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2080
01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.950
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2081
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:31.560
<v Speaker 5>to figure out a way to make that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause they like it's,</v>

2083
01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:38.970
<v Speaker 5>it's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like right now somebody since we started</v>

2084
01:37:38.971 --> 01:37:43.320
<v Speaker 5>talking is getting something onto a</v>
<v Speaker 5>computer record cause we used to not</v>

2085
01:37:43.321 --> 01:37:46.590
<v Speaker 5>have computer records and so now</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody is getting a computer record</v>

2086
01:37:46.591 --> 01:37:51.420
<v Speaker 5>that they shoplifted so there goes all</v>
<v Speaker 5>their entry level employment fucking</v>

2087
01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:52.380
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2088
01:37:52.381 --> 01:37:53.280
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four years.</v>

2089
01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 5>Good luck with have fun</v>

2090
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.930
<v Speaker 3>filing for disability that that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to somebody else and it's going</v>

2091
01:37:59.931 --> 01:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>to happen again in a couple more</v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

2092
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2093
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.390
<v Speaker 3>it's not the sensational cases that get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2094
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it's the grinding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the every single guy gets a little</v>

2095
01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 3>more than some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it's just a gradual creep.</v>

2096
01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Like mothers against drunk driving keeps</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing the law like the legal limit</v>

2097
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:23.781
<v Speaker 3>for alcohol down and down and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't change the study that</v>

2098
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 3>they have the cops point to to say why</v>
<v Speaker 3>the field sobriety tests work.</v>

2099
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So like in the 70s the horizontal gaze</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nystagmus test would say that a</v>

2100
01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 3>horizontal gaze Nystagmus sets in prior</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 45 degrees.</v>

2101
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Only if you're above a point to or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they redid the study and now</v>

2102
01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 3>his 0.15 and then they read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain what that means.</v>

2103
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever seen somebody get pulled</v>

2104
01:38:50.371 --> 01:38:54.180
<v Speaker 3>over by an officer and then the officer</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a bright light and they're on the</v>

2105
01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 3>side of the road as a bunch of cars go</v>
<v Speaker 3>past like fucking strobe lights.</v>

2106
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.300
<v Speaker 3>So they'll have you look at a pen and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll trace it like this.</v>

2107
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 3>And so prior to 45 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2108
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I should track very smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I move it quickly,</v>

2109
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.990
<v Speaker 3>if I move it slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be a little bit of Stutter,</v>

2110
01:39:12.991 --> 01:39:17.991
<v Speaker 3>but I'm supposed to do the test quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if I put it there and hold it,</v>

2111
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:20.640
<v Speaker 3>I look for a little bit of aggravated</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nystagmus.</v>

2112
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:25.940
<v Speaker 3>And so the national highway traffic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>safety authority or National Highway</v>

2113
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Traffic Safety Board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2114
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 3>put together this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>

2115
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.650
<v Speaker 3>and then the one leg stand and the walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>and turn test.</v>

2116
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And they say that you can tell if</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's drunk,</v>

2117
01:39:34.410 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 3>if they fail these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tests aren't accurate at all.</v>

2118
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 3>And they were originally picked in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>70s when the limit was higher.</v>

2119
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 3>And they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these tests will only detect somebody</v>

2120
01:39:43.951 --> 01:39:47.880
<v Speaker 3>above 0.2 and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they changed the legal limit,</v>

2121
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:52.910
<v Speaker 3>they didn't change the test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So remember in the 70s your eyes weren't</v>

2122
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:58.791
<v Speaker 3>going to quiver over here unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>above 0.2 but now in the 80s they're</v>

2123
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:04.941
<v Speaker 3>telling cops that the eyes will quiver</v>
<v Speaker 3>above 0.1 and now here in the two</v>

2124
01:40:05.101 --> 01:40:09.270
<v Speaker 3>thousands they're telling them cops that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eyes will quiver at that point above</v>

2125
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:10.104
<v Speaker 3>0.08</v>

2126
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:14.370
<v Speaker 2>so they've changed the data to</v>
<v Speaker 2>correspond with the new laws.</v>

2127
01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:17.460
<v Speaker 3>They didn't change the data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even they just said,</v>

2128
01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:21.150
<v Speaker 3>did it still works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the point of that test was</v>

2129
01:40:21.151 --> 01:40:25.590
<v Speaker 3>to pick people up above two point above,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much higher limit above.</v>

2130
01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.930
<v Speaker 3>They're looking for people at 0.15</v>

2131
01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.500
<v Speaker 2>so not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the data,</v>

2132
01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:30.200
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2133
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>the number that they use to determine</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're,</v>

2134
01:40:32.621 --> 01:40:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drunk or sober.</v>

2135
01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:35.210
<v Speaker 2>How did they know the method?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2136
01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Know what I'm saying is it's not a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

2137
01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:38.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they lowered the limit,</v>

2138
01:40:38.651 --> 01:40:39.461
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the lemon,</v>

2139
01:40:39.461 --> 01:40:41.770
<v Speaker 2>it used to be 2.0 yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now what is it now?</v>

2140
01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.500
<v Speaker 2>One Point six 0.0 8.08 sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did they use to determine?</v>

2142
01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:48.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2143
01:40:48.610 --> 01:40:51.310
<v Speaker 2>if that was what was originally</v>
<v Speaker 2>established that you had to do,</v>

2144
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>the field sobriety would indicate</v>

2145
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 5>that some was about how when once the</v>
<v Speaker 5>limit got lowered,</v>

2146
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:58.660
<v Speaker 5>how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do they keep that same test?</v>

2147
01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Like what are they used to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't care.</v>

2148
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.210
<v Speaker 5>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do they say in that?</v>

2149
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 5>The booklet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can tell it so they just say it</v>

2150
01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 5>just change the number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see it at 0.08 with no data to</v>

2151
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 5>back it up and alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Dad's got the fucking manual from the</v>

2152
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 5>70s he's got the manual from the 80s got</v>
<v Speaker 5>the manual from the 90s and got the</v>

2153
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:17.930
<v Speaker 5>manual from today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2154
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.520
<v Speaker 5>it seems so they don't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2155
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 5>but you assume though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2156
01:41:22.481 --> 01:41:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't you that if someone fails that</v>
<v Speaker 5>test,</v>

2157
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 5>that test would indicate their 2.0 will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll definitely 0.8 then.</v>

2158
01:41:28.730 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 5>So really you don't have to change it</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2159
01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:34.210
<v Speaker 5>but scientifically they probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well they established like when,</v>

2160
01:41:34.410 --> 01:41:38.110
<v Speaker 5>but they're using it for proof that</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody has a 0.08 right.</v>

2161
01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:42.970
<v Speaker 5>When it's only effective to prove that</v>
<v Speaker 5>their 0.15 or above for example.</v>

2162
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>

2163
01:41:44.291 --> 01:41:48.610
<v Speaker 5>this test is designed for people at 0.15</v>
<v Speaker 5>to fail and they're saying people at</v>

2164
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:51.010
<v Speaker 5>Point Oh eight or failing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing is though,</v>

2165
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 5>so they just don't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you,</v>

2166
01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:56.740
<v Speaker 5>when they test them with a breathalyzer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they just barely make it illegal,</v>

2167
01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 5>but they still fail the field sobriety</v>
<v Speaker 5>tests.</v>

2168
01:41:58.571 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2169
01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's subjective.</v>

2170
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The tests are subjective and we pretend</v>

2171
01:42:04.361 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 5>that Wa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like one leg stand,</v>

2172
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:10.300
<v Speaker 5>it's seven potential.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Qs is somehow an effective way of</v>

2173
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 5>looking at somebody and tell them if</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're drunk,</v>

2174
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:14.890
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now look at them would,</v>

2175
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 5>if somebody tells passes a test,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what have you pulled them over?</v>

2176
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:19.870
<v Speaker 5>They pass a test,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then they don't want to take any</v>

2177
01:42:19.871 --> 01:42:20.704
<v Speaker 5>further test.</v>

2178
01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:21.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2179
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:22.150
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I passed your test,</v>

2180
01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I did all your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to take any breathalyzer.</v>

2181
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 5>In most of the states of the union,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're required to give a sample of your</v>

2182
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:28.750
<v Speaker 5>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breath or urine.</v>

2183
01:42:28.751 --> 01:42:31.690
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they'll charge you with refusal.</v>

2184
01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.190
<v Speaker 5>That's a fourth amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fifth amendment violation if ever there</v>

2185
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:37.870
<v Speaker 5>was one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because the police,</v>

2186
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:42.070
<v Speaker 5>when most of their arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mostly okay,</v>

2187
01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 5>they had to go isolation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well because you can't be forced to give</v>

2188
01:42:45.971 --> 01:42:50.890
<v Speaker 5>evidence against yourself and they want</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to give evidence from you that</v>

2189
01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:54.250
<v Speaker 5>they'll use to convict you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they want to do that at the scene of</v>

2190
01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:57.530
<v Speaker 5>the crime with no legal representation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you have your lawyer there</v>

2191
01:42:57.531 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 5>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2192
01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:00.110
<v Speaker 5>Mr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying here,</v>

2193
01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:03.670
<v Speaker 5>they're saying we could only prove that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you drove drunk if you give us your</v>

2194
01:43:03.671 --> 01:43:05.800
<v Speaker 5>fucking blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now give us your blood.</v>

2195
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.800
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they used to be duped,</v>

2196
01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:11.290
<v Speaker 5>forcing blood draws and doing that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>without warrants.</v>

2197
01:43:11.291 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 5>And a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the supreme court was like,</v>

2198
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:15.580
<v Speaker 5>you guys need to get warrants for this</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2199
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:18.040
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is now they get warrants.</v>

2200
01:43:18.041 --> 01:43:20.980
<v Speaker 5>But isn't it problematic that it takes a</v>
<v Speaker 5>long time to get a warrant?</v>

2201
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:22.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long does it take to get a warrant?</v>

2202
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 5>Like say if a guy gets pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say,</v>

2203
01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:24.874
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this dude's drunk.</v>

2204
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Hey Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give me some blood.</v>

2205
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna give you any blood.</v>

2206
01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:28.060
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to call the cops.</v>

2207
01:43:28.061 --> 01:43:29.200
<v Speaker 5>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 minutes.</v>

2208
01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.310
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can be faster.</v>

2209
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.173
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Tell us that it was those warrants or</v>
<v Speaker 5>files.</v>

2211
01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:35.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2212
01:43:35.621 --> 01:43:38.560
<v Speaker 5>like some jurisdictions warrants do take</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2213
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:41.530
<v Speaker 5>but other places you can be issued a</v>
<v Speaker 5>warrant over the telephone.</v>

2214
01:43:41.531 --> 01:43:44.040
<v Speaker 5>But what if he gets to make a phone call</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it calls Governor Clinton?</v>

2215
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:45.460
<v Speaker 5>Governor Clinton says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2216
01:43:45.461 --> 01:43:48.480
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to let him call you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loosen your domain.</v>

2217
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.080
<v Speaker 5>I know a guy who knows God well</v>

2218
01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.450
<v Speaker 4>let just let them dry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can take the test in a little while.</v>

2219
01:43:56.710 --> 01:43:59.260
<v Speaker 4>He's not prepared when we need to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>over this paperwork first.</v>

2220
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so those tests are bullshit and they use</v>

2221
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:06.110
<v Speaker 4>them because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the officer needs to be able</v>

2222
01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 4>to sit up there and say that you did</v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit wrong.</v>

2223
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me say this a,</v>

2224
01:44:10.011 --> 01:44:13.280
<v Speaker 4>so if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are a criminal defense attorney.</v>

2225
01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 4>You get a guy who's on a drunk driving</v>
<v Speaker 4>case,</v>

2226
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cops busted them,</v>

2227
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.470
<v Speaker 4>but they busted him by forcing him to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give blood.</v>

2228
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.610
<v Speaker 4>How do you defend that?</v>

2229
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:29.250
<v Speaker 3>First you look at the stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you find out how long they were</v>

2230
01:44:29.251 --> 01:44:34.251
<v Speaker 3>following him and if how much a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving and how much bad driving they</v>

2231
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:37.050
<v Speaker 3>viewed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for that you would,</v>

2232
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do a good job,</v>

2233
01:44:39.451 --> 01:44:42.630
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're defending a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rich person who has the money to</v>

2234
01:44:42.631 --> 01:44:45.600
<v Speaker 3>pay for this Bill Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're defending Bill Gates.</v>

2235
01:44:45.601 --> 01:44:50.460
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to order the squad video</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to open records</v>

2236
01:44:50.461 --> 01:44:52.530
<v Speaker 3>requests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the radio communications and the</v>

2237
01:44:52.531 --> 01:44:55.830
<v Speaker 3>teletypes from the squad car to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>else because they might be saying</v>

2238
01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:57.930
<v Speaker 3>something racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they might be saying something.</v>

2239
01:44:58.410 --> 01:45:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So you pull the teletypes and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to want the conduct records</v>

2240
01:45:02.191 --> 01:45:05.400
<v Speaker 3>of all the officers and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to want to find out if you can</v>

2241
01:45:05.401 --> 01:45:09.480
<v Speaker 3>pursue any administrative appeals of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>temporary suspension of the license.</v>

2242
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:12.060
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to do that because two</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

2243
01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.800
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want your client's license</v>

2244
01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:14.910
<v Speaker 3>suspended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and two,</v>

2245
01:45:15.210 --> 01:45:18.150
<v Speaker 3>you might also find some things because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to get a couple of</v>

2246
01:45:18.151 --> 01:45:22.140
<v Speaker 3>records and forced the cops to show up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and drop some paperwork off for you that</v>

2247
01:45:22.141 --> 01:45:25.080
<v Speaker 3>you have in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're going to look at the stop</v>

2248
01:45:25.081 --> 01:45:29.040
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to file a motion saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the stop was illegal because of x,</v>

2249
01:45:29.041 --> 01:45:29.874
<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and z.</v>

2250
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll argue about the bail</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>

2251
01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Then you'll order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

2252
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:40.380
<v Speaker 3>you'll wait about six to eight weeks for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the results for the blood test results</v>

2253
01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:45.150
<v Speaker 3>to come back as soon as they come back</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even before you file a motion that</v>

2254
01:45:45.151 --> 01:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>you've been working on saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood test results are problematic</v>

2255
01:45:48.631 --> 01:45:53.580
<v Speaker 3>because they were illegally drawn or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>facility is not accredited or the person</v>

2256
01:45:53.581 --> 01:45:56.940
<v Speaker 3>who administered the test is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>accredited or the machine has not been</v>

2257
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:58.710
<v Speaker 3>maintained properly.</v>

2258
01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:03.030
<v Speaker 3>At the same time you order the reports</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the machine maintenance because</v>

2259
01:46:03.031 --> 01:46:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that when they do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blanks,</v>

2260
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:09.090
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they're not when they run them</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a gas chromatograph mass</v>

2261
01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:13.020
<v Speaker 3>spectrometer or whatever system they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to use when they do these samples.</v>

2262
01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.700
<v Speaker 3>So I mean these are guys with technical</v>
<v Speaker 3>college to degrees or bachelor's degrees</v>

2263
01:46:17.701 --> 01:46:20.670
<v Speaker 3>that have taken a six to eight week</v>
<v Speaker 3>course and they might be pretty good at</v>

2264
01:46:20.671 --> 01:46:22.260
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still fuck ups.</v>

2265
01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:25.680
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes things come in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not sealed.</v>

2266
01:46:25.681 --> 01:46:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there's a problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>vacuum cleaner that they use for the</v>

2267
01:46:28.861 --> 01:46:33.861
<v Speaker 3>blood draw and sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the stuff that they put in the</v>

2268
01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:40.191
<v Speaker 3>Vacu tainer in advance to keep the blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>from coagulating is expired or has a</v>

2269
01:46:43.321 --> 01:46:46.380
<v Speaker 3>problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to check that out.</v>

2270
01:46:46.381 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 3>So if you have an extremely rich</v>
<v Speaker 3>defendant,</v>

2271
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:55.190
<v Speaker 3>every thing from your fucking eye color</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in question.</v>

2272
01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.633
<v Speaker 3>Basically the,</v>

2273
01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.240
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2274
01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.700
<v Speaker 3>every step of the way where anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

2275
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you have a question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So wisdom machine properly and who</v>

2276
01:47:04.631 --> 01:47:07.630
<v Speaker 3>program these fucking machines?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I see the code?</v>

2277
01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Because if I can't see the code to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine,</v>

2278
01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't say at all if this machine</v>

2279
01:47:15.931 --> 01:47:18.240
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we don't know the code.</v>

2280
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.660
<v Speaker 3>And for a lot of these devices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the code is proprietary and they won't</v>

2281
01:47:23.791 --> 01:47:28.320
<v Speaker 3>give you the code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they won't allow you to know how some</v>

2282
01:47:28.321 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 3>of the machines that they use to watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work.</v>

2283
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.780
<v Speaker 3>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an attorney at war as a defendant,</v>

2284
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:37.290
<v Speaker 3>you can't actually point to a problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2285
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:40.260
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't carry the one and you doubled</v>

2286
01:47:40.261 --> 01:47:41.940
<v Speaker 3>my fucking result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>

2287
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this shows that it was,</v>

2288
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm patient four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

2289
01:47:46.111 --> 01:47:46.681
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

2290
01:47:46.681 --> 01:47:49.260
<v Speaker 3>this is for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sometimes they won't give you those</v>

2291
01:47:49.261 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 3>records or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you have a problem.</v>

2292
01:47:52.381 --> 01:47:56.820
<v Speaker 3>You hope actually that they don't give</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shit because when they do give you</v>

2293
01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:58.290
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's proof that it's generally in</v>

2294
01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:00.390
<v Speaker 3>working order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when shit comes late,</v>

2295
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.740
<v Speaker 3>it means there's a fucking problem.</v>

2296
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's when you know you smell blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you start to chase that down.</v>

2297
01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>

2298
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the next point you do is you go</v>

2299
01:48:10.621 --> 01:48:14.040
<v Speaker 3>and you try and settle the case and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think here are the guidelines.</v>

2300
01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Because most out of Uis guideline</v>
<v Speaker 3>offenses,</v>

2301
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.900
<v Speaker 3>most places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people get a first one and then</v>

2302
01:48:18.901 --> 01:48:20.850
<v Speaker 3>they get a second and a third and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fourth and fifth.</v>

2303
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:23.100
<v Speaker 3>And even though the penalties go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2304
01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause the more out of Uis people have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less dangerous they tend to be</v>

2305
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 3>during those adobe wys like sevens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll hit park cars all fucking day,</v>

2306
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:35.040
<v Speaker 3>but they don't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two's kill people.</v>

2307
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.630
<v Speaker 3>First offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk drivers,</v>

2308
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:39.240
<v Speaker 3>they fucking kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2309
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:42.870
<v Speaker 3>so people just get better at drunk</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving is absolutely they do.</v>

2310
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.400
<v Speaker 3>It's horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2311
01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:46.360
<v Speaker 3>they do make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

2312
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:48:46.610 --> 01:48:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With everything in line and they take</v>

2314
01:48:47.971 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 3>certain roads and they drive slower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they compensate for it.</v>

2315
01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:51.960
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2316
01:48:51.961 --> 01:48:54.180
<v Speaker 3>they're used to being drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're alcoholics,</v>

2317
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.280
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2318
01:48:56.281 --> 01:48:57.710
<v Speaker 3>that was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this surgical precisely this to the way</v>

2320
01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:04.350
<v Speaker 3>you broke down the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now what is the difference between a</v>

2321
01:49:04.351 --> 01:49:09.351
<v Speaker 3>rich person and someone who gets an</v>
<v Speaker 3>attorney assigned to them by the state.</v>

2322
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2323
01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 3>you want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2324
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:16.080
<v Speaker 3>you want to get like pick a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2325
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.830
<v Speaker 3>let's use the same crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2326
01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's drunk driving because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2327
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:20.650
<v Speaker 3>poor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2328
01:49:20.650 --> 01:49:22.020
<v Speaker 3>let's pull over and you're handling</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2329
01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't do all those things.</v>

2330
01:49:23.731 --> 01:49:24.960
<v Speaker 3>You want to know you can't do those</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2331
01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:30.200
<v Speaker 3>So what you have to do is you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do everything that you can do on that</v>

2332
01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:33.570
<v Speaker 3>list because in 90% of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kate,</v>

2333
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.290
<v Speaker 3>of those times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe even 99% of the time,</v>

2334
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 3>those avenues will be completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruitless.</v>

2335
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Those won't get you shit because route,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2336
01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 3>stops routinely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rubber stamped warrants,</v>

2337
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:54.130
<v Speaker 3>rubber stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the machines are generally agreed to</v>

2338
01:49:54.131 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 3>be in working order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of places there are statutes</v>

2339
01:49:56.891 --> 01:50:00.580
<v Speaker 3>meant to protect the you from even being</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to get this information.</v>

2340
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but things that really do work are like</v>

2341
01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:11.370
<v Speaker 3>bring their family to sentencing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people who are convicted of crimes</v>

2342
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:14.890
<v Speaker 3>had been convicted of a compliment</v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes and nobody shows up for them</v>

2343
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 3>anymore and nobody gives a shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2344
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:19.150
<v Speaker 3>And what's going to happen is they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to go in and they're going to do</v>

2345
01:50:19.151 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 3>their time and they're going to get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody's going to give shit about</v>

2346
01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:22.660
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they're going to do something else</v>

2347
01:50:22.661 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 3>and then you get to go back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you've got a family there,</v>

2348
01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:28.810
<v Speaker 3>the judge can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will somebody still cares about this</v>

2349
01:50:28.811 --> 01:50:29.440
<v Speaker 3>asshole?</v>

2350
01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Somebody still thinks there's some good</v>
<v Speaker 3>in them.</v>

2351
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:34.840
<v Speaker 3>I bet there's some good in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got a couple people who are</v>

2352
01:50:34.841 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 3>willing to show up and watch him take</v>
<v Speaker 3>his medicine,</v>

2353
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.410
<v Speaker 3>watch him see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch him admit he fucked up and</v>

2354
01:50:41.411 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 3>promised to try to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these guys are kind of on our side.</v>

2355
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:48.670
<v Speaker 3>These guys are going to try and help</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy not come back here and that</v>

2356
01:50:48.671 --> 01:50:52.000
<v Speaker 3>will shorten your sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have supportive people in your</v>

2357
01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 3>side of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will shorten your sentence.</v>

2358
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2359
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Things that are open to rich people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it.</v>

2360
01:50:59.681 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean all almost all expert witnesses</v>
<v Speaker 3>are horse.</v>

2361
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Like people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would ask me like,</v>

2362
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:10.090
<v Speaker 3>well how do you like how do you choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>an expert?</v>

2363
01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 3>And I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2364
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I just ask everybody else what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>expert they use.</v>

2365
01:51:14.410 --> 01:51:16.870
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if the expert says something you</v>

2366
01:51:16.871 --> 01:51:18.520
<v Speaker 3>don't want them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2367
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:21.580
<v Speaker 3>that does not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

2368
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.360
<v Speaker 3>do you tell the expert what to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2369
01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.840
<v Speaker 3>The expert knows if the prosecution or</v>
<v Speaker 3>defense or plaintiff or defendant calls</v>

2370
01:51:31.781 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know which side you're on.</v>

2371
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:38.050
<v Speaker 3>And miraculously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every fucking expert I've ever offered</v>

2372
01:51:38.051 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 3>money to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give me their honest and completely</v>

2373
01:51:41.381 --> 01:51:45.850
<v Speaker 3>unbiased opinion has said I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds?</v>

2374
01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Every single fucking one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must really know how to pick quality</v>

2375
01:51:49.211 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 3>attorneys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess quality,</v>

2376
01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:53.620
<v Speaker 3>professional experts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality experts.</v>

2377
01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:55.570
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is like they're just,</v>

2378
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:56.890
<v Speaker 3>they're whores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're whores,</v>

2379
01:51:56.950 --> 01:52:00.370
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a business in being a horse.</v>

2380
01:52:00.371 --> 01:52:04.300
<v Speaker 3>So like if you're looking for a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a a DNA expert or you're looking</v>

2381
01:52:04.301 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 3>for a guy who was a chemical expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know the guy to call because</v>

2382
01:52:07.901 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 3>other friends who have used them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar cases.</v>

2383
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:11.253
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2384
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:13.960
<v Speaker 3>and there are guys there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're all whores.</v>

2385
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:17.680
<v Speaker 3>There are some guys who are solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>because whores do tell the truth.</v>

2386
01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:20.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like horse do important work,</v>

2387
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:25.180
<v Speaker 3>but they are horse and you should never</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget that.</v>

2388
01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.050
<v Speaker 3>That's something I think Republicans get</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they argue about climate change.</v>

2389
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:33.400
<v Speaker 3>That's why they don't listen to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking billion scientists on one side</v>

2390
01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 3>because they know like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2391
01:52:34.721 --> 01:52:37.240
<v Speaker 3>you can just buy a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't realize that these are the</v>

2392
01:52:37.241 --> 01:52:40.810
<v Speaker 3>studies that weren't bought and that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>should actually believe these,</v>

2393
01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know how it is because they've seen</v>

2394
01:52:44.051 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 3>that happen over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

2395
01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Like Monsanto by studies and they marry</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies and attorneys do the same thing.</v>

2396
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:54.380
<v Speaker 3>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hire an expert and miraculously the</v>

2397
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:56.810
<v Speaker 3>expert just agrees with them every</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time.</v>

2398
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>

2399
01:52:57.950 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I would expect that I would hire an</v>
<v Speaker 3>expert sometime and they would say,</v>

2400
01:53:01.701 --> 01:53:02.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Schmidt,</v>

2401
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2402
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:09.020
<v Speaker 3>these fingerprints are a match,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then never know.</v>

2403
01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:12.170
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this is because I</v>

2404
01:53:12.171 --> 01:53:13.700
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you communicating with these guys</v>

2405
01:53:13.701 --> 01:53:14.840
<v Speaker 3>beforehand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you,</v>

2406
01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:16.340
<v Speaker 3>when you hire an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any,</v>

2407
01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:21.610
<v Speaker 3>I never ever said anything to any of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them about how I wanted them to just say</v>

2408
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.550
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how much do you pay in these guys?</v>

2409
01:53:25.551 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you bring a guy who was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fingerprints guy,</v>

2410
01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.520
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2411
01:53:28.730 --> 01:53:33.730
<v Speaker 3>if you're public defender's office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pay no more than a grand or</v>

2412
01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:35.330
<v Speaker 3>1500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

2413
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 3>And you got to pay it out of your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>pocket and then they'll reimburse you in</v>

2414
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:44.051
<v Speaker 3>like six months after the trials done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have experts functionally</v>

2415
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:49.130
<v Speaker 3>if you got money and expert can run yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 grand.</v>

2416
01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2417
01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.540
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it depends on the type of case.</v>

2418
01:53:52.541 --> 01:53:56.680
<v Speaker 3>If it's medical or if it's an end state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state will fly.</v>

2419
01:53:56.681 --> 01:54:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you throw piss on a guard,</v>

2420
01:54:01.210 --> 01:54:03.580
<v Speaker 3>do you know it's hard for them to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's pissed,</v>

2421
01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:07.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's a felony in most jurisdictions</v>
<v Speaker 3>to throw urine on uh,</v>

2422
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:11.320
<v Speaker 3>on security personnel at a prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called gassing,</v>

2423
01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:17.130
<v Speaker 3>but it costs extra money because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are actually very few experts who</v>

2424
01:54:19.451 --> 01:54:21.520
<v Speaker 3>can say that this is urine.</v>

2425
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2426
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:28.320
<v Speaker 3>This person through on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the test for urine versus it's</v>

2427
01:54:28.321 --> 01:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it costs money to fly someone to say</v>

2428
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:37.230
<v Speaker 3>that this guy did throw piss on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guard and here's this scientist who can</v>

2429
01:54:37.231 --> 01:54:40.320
<v Speaker 3>say beyond a reasonable doubt that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>pis.</v>

2430
01:54:41.190 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 3>They really have to fly someone from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia sometimes to Wisconsin to</v>

2431
01:54:46.231 --> 01:54:51.180
<v Speaker 3>say that was piss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucked up our system is.</v>

2432
01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.880
<v Speaker 3>That to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was pissed in a felony trial.</v>

2433
01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.860
<v Speaker 3>We need a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so no wonder they're fucking horse</v>

2434
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:06.480
<v Speaker 3>because that's the shit we put.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we make them privy or part of our</v>

2435
01:55:06.481 --> 01:55:10.380
<v Speaker 3>little stupid disputes like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>continuously and it warps them just the</v>

2436
01:55:10.381 --> 01:55:12.860
<v Speaker 3>same way it warps everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2437
01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.670
<v Speaker 3>good God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a bleak picture.</v>

2438
01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the important thing to remember is</v>

2439
01:55:19.771 --> 01:55:22.290
<v Speaker 3>most people are outside and having fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time.</v>

2440
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not important because what if</v>

2441
01:55:25.231 --> 01:55:29.100
<v Speaker 3>something happens and you happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving while black and all of a sudden</v>

2442
01:55:29.101 --> 01:55:31.320
<v Speaker 3>you're in the same situation that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>

2443
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:35.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you wind up getting extracted from</v>

2444
01:55:35.101 --> 01:55:36.720
<v Speaker 3>this beautiful outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Well stuck in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that we all have to do</v>

2446
01:55:39.781 --> 01:55:43.020
<v Speaker 3>something about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if anybody's got ideas,</v>

2447
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>well I</v>

2448
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>think talking about it is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2449
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't aware of it to the extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously I have zero knowledge</v>

2450
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:51.900
<v Speaker 2>of what it's like in Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin,</v>

2451
01:55:51.901 --> 01:55:54.990
<v Speaker 2>other than the few times I've visited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hearing you describe it and</v>

2452
01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 2>especially zero knowledge of what it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like inside the criminal justice system.</v>

2453
01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:00.990
<v Speaker 2>But hearing you describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2454
01:56:00.991 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2455
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty disheartening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2456
01:56:04.121 --> 01:56:05.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's atrocious.</v>

2457
01:56:05.281 --> 01:56:07.640
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary and it seems like an</v>

2458
01:56:07.641 --> 01:56:09.390
<v Speaker 2>excusable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like if you're looking at the</v>

2459
01:56:09.391 --> 01:56:13.350
<v Speaker 2>raw data as far as like what happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be both the black and what happens with</v>

2460
01:56:13.351 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 2>her wife at first offenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's garbage.</v>

2461
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our best idea was teaching some</v>

2462
01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:22.800
<v Speaker 2>children to garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2463
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2464
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:24.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a,</v>

2465
01:56:24.991 --> 01:56:28.920
<v Speaker 2>in yellowstone recently and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really beautiful,</v>

2466
01:56:28.921 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things it was freaking me</v>
<v Speaker 2>out was that it was,</v>

2467
01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:35.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created by an act of Congress in 1872.</v>

2468
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.781
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2469
01:56:36.781 --> 01:56:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good Lord,</v>

2470
01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.110
<v Speaker 2>like I'm 1872,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2471
01:56:40.111 --> 01:56:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I was alive in 1972.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago.</v>

2472
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 2>That's fairly recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was thinking that's only</v>

2473
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:51.621
<v Speaker 2>seven years after slavery was abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I looked it up and it's 14</v>

2474
01:56:52.201 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 2>years before the creation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gasoline powered automobile.</v>

2475
01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:57.533
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2476
01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.760
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2477
01:56:59.761 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing how recent all this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with someone,</v>

2479
01:57:07.110 --> 01:57:08.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Byron bowers,</v>

2480
01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:13.170
<v Speaker 2>do you know Byron area standup comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Byron was talking about,</v>

2481
01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Byron's black and he was talking about</v>

2482
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:20.781
<v Speaker 2>his grandmother remembering his great</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandmother telling her about the</v>

2483
01:57:21.931 --> 01:57:25.350
<v Speaker 2>invention of the cotton gin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eli Whitney.</v>

2484
01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she was around for that.</v>

2485
01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:31.440
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2486
01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about different relatives</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he had,</v>

2487
01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great grandmothers and what have you</v>

2488
01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:41.540
<v Speaker 2>that were slaves and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2489
01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 2>really hits home.</v>

2490
01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so like for us,</v>

2491
01:57:45.631 --> 01:57:46.630
<v Speaker 2>we grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

2492
01:57:46.631 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 2>when you were a little kid and you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>1865,</v>

2493
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:49.801
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2494
01:57:49.801 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking forever ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as life goes on,</v>

2495
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:56.800
<v Speaker 2>the perspective sort of comes clearer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and clearer and a focus when you</v>

2496
01:57:56.801 --> 01:57:57.631
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2497
01:57:57.631 --> 01:57:59.680
<v Speaker 2>like that was a blink ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2498
01:57:59.681 --> 01:58:02.700
<v Speaker 2>1965 was essentially a cultural blink</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

2499
01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:07.190
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at like the history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>China or the history of England even,</v>

2500
01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:09.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this massive long history.</v>

2501
01:58:09.601 --> 01:58:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And then the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know 1865 is fucking nothing.</v>

2502
01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2503
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2504
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:19.560
<v Speaker 2>we're really young country where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that are seven times as old as</v>

2505
01:58:19.561 --> 01:58:24.561
<v Speaker 2>we are and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all I got it.</v>

2506
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I want to say one more thing about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal justice system.</v>

2507
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas powered automobile electricity,</v>

2508
01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:37.490
<v Speaker 2>telecommunications space travel and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>slavery and we still have fundamentally</v>

2509
01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 2>the same criminal justice system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why we didn't improve</v>

2510
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.350
<v Speaker 5>on it one bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We added some,</v>

2511
01:58:44.351 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 5>we added a couple things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not fundamentally different.</v>

2512
01:58:47.771 --> 01:58:50.530
<v Speaker 5>It was designed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the Dana Law,</v>

2513
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking vikings used to use it and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it became the English common law,</v>

2514
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 5>like what should it be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think?</v>

2515
01:58:58.901 --> 01:59:01.870
<v Speaker 5>Like is there an ideal system with</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone as a proposed?</v>

2516
01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:02.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2517
01:59:02.741 --> 01:59:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's an ideal system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do think that right now a country</v>

2518
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:09.070
<v Speaker 5>of 346 million people.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's kind of the idea of the country.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

2538
01:59:53.651 --> 01:59:55.570
<v Speaker 5>If you fly over the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize there's a lot of spots.</v>

2539
01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of spots and we're kind of</v>

2540
01:59:57.341 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 5>being dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's some people who like,</v>

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.293
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2543
02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:06.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>president trump's going to pull a nice</v>

2544
02:00:06.731 --> 02:00:09.280
<v Speaker 5>wall and stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop everything.</v>

2545
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:13.810

<v Speaker 5>we should fucking put the feelers out,</v>

2546
02:00:13.811 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 5>put the vibes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then if we see like a population</v>

2547
02:00:16.931 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 5>that gets treated like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should fucking just steal them.</v>

2548
02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 5>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2549
02:00:21.401 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 5>there's countries where it's illegal to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be homosexual,</v>

2550
02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:27.010
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we got room,</v>

2551
02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.200
<v Speaker 5>we should just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>can you call your homos?</v>

<v Speaker 5>They all have discretionary income.</v>

2554
02:00:33.191 --> 02:00:35.140
<v Speaker 5>Cause most of the time they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids to go for the economy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>jail.</v>

2581
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.760
<v Speaker 5>And if you lock people up with hot</v>

<v Speaker 5>They're just going to bang each other.</v>

2586
02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.320
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with the policy then.</v>

2587
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it results in women</v>

2588
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 4>in prison films.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2589
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.180
<v Speaker 4>It's always the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's the female guard that gets</v>

02:01:45.181 --> 02:01:47.420
<v Speaker 4>reduced like that Tupac Song.</v>

2593
02:01:56.410 --> 02:01:58.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a guard,</v>

2594
02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:03.500
<v Speaker 4>it was like some movie about a guard</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had a relationship with some guy</v>

2595
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 4>who was a prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dude could apparently lie on his</v>

2596
02:02:06.561 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 4>back without touching his penis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can make his dick or rack and he</v>

2597
02:02:10.401 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 4>could ejaculate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he had time to practice.</v>

2598
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean that is amazing what it is.</v>

2599
02:02:18.201 --> 02:02:20.270
<v Speaker 4>Guy Put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see these urban myths,</v>

2600
02:02:20.271 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tell.</v>

2601
02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.960
<v Speaker 4>There's no camera on this dude deck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2602
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:25.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2603
02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:27.620
<v Speaker 4>if he could really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he die in prison?</v>

2604
02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2605
02:02:30.031 --> 02:02:32.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you could do that and you</v>

2606
02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 4>didn't die in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody probably paid you money to film</v>

2607
02:02:35.241 --> 02:02:35.450
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2608
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:36.261
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this.</v>

2609
02:02:36.261 --> 02:02:38.120
<v Speaker 4>When it's a subject to restitution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think,</v>

2610
02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>

2611
02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 4>I'll get off with time served plus</v>
<v Speaker 4>restitution.</v>

2612
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:47.470
<v Speaker 4>If you can make Dick porn and jail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like say if that guy didn't do anything</v>

2613
02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.340
<v Speaker 4>too terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe just robbed a bunch of liquor</v>

2614
02:02:49.341 --> 02:02:53.390
<v Speaker 4>stores or something like that and all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sudden he's in jail and he realizes</v>

2615
02:02:53.391 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 4>that he's practiced by himself in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>zen room so long that he could get his</v>

2616
02:02:57.651 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 4>dick hard and come all over himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would pay money to see that.</v>

2617
02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:02.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if he starts like his own,</v>

2618
02:03:02.841 --> 02:03:03.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2619
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:06.080
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I myself website from jail.</v>

2620
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Webcam service makes a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2621
02:03:08.530 --> 02:03:09.920
<v Speaker 4>It gives it to the victims.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2622
02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:12.080
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think it's constructive.</v>

2623
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he should start by,</v>

2624
02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 4>I think anyone who's interested in doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2625
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:20.390
<v Speaker 4>whatever correctional facility there in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps write to the judge that</v>

2626
02:03:20.391 --> 02:03:24.200
<v Speaker 4>sentenced you and request that you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same or just an opportunity.</v>

2627
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I have no doubt that people can do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if someone can have a wet dream,</v>

2628
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 4>that means their fantasy is allowing</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to ejaculate.</v>

2629
02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think there's some people that have</v>

2630
02:03:33.171 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 4>done some really amazing things with</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mind,</v>

2631
02:03:35.331 --> 02:03:37.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people that practice</v>

2632
02:03:37.221 --> 02:03:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Kundalini Yoga and they get to some</v>
<v Speaker 4>place where they can have some trance</v>

2633
02:03:40.131 --> 02:03:42.920
<v Speaker 4>and they have psychedelic states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2634
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:45.380
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not skeptical.</v>

2635
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you could do it.</v>

2636
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Like I bet that sounds like something</v>
<v Speaker 4>where if you practiced,</v>

2637
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:54.260
<v Speaker 4>if you just waited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause there's dudes who just in their</v>

2638
02:03:54.261 --> 02:03:55.760
<v Speaker 4>pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when women walk up to him,</v>

2639
02:03:56.050 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is just like a little bit more</v>

2640
02:03:59.061 --> 02:03:59.990
<v Speaker 4>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2641
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:02.690
<v Speaker 4>The fact that that dude did it for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guard.</v>

2642
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Kapow let her know what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2643
02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.070

<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

2644
02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like on command and salad bar must</v>

2645
02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:13.370
<v Speaker 4>happen because that's what I'll also</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened up in upstate New York.</v>

2646
02:04:13.371 --> 02:04:14.770
<v Speaker 4>When those guys get free and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2647
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:16.580
<v Speaker 4>those murders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tracked him to Canada.</v>

2648
02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:19.490
<v Speaker 4>The woman was supposed to let them out</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they escaped and the woman was</v>

2649
02:04:19.491 --> 02:04:21.140
<v Speaker 4>supposed to meet them outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

2650
02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the same situation.</v>

2651
02:04:23.451 --> 02:04:24.760
<v Speaker 4>Homely lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2654
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:28.663
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2655
02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:32.750
<v Speaker 4>when I first started visiting prisons</v>
<v Speaker 4>for clients,</v>

2656
02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:36.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy who was a former,</v>

2657
02:04:36.441 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 4>I think it was secretary of</v>

2658
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.150
<v Speaker 3>the Department of Corrections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was our criminal law professor ran us</v>

2659
02:04:42.151 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 3>through a whole bunch of shit we have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch out for when we go into prison.</v>

2660
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 3>And one of them was inmates trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>seduce you.</v>

2661
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2662
02:04:50.330 --> 02:04:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Even dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they got nothing going on.</v>

2664
02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just try it.</v>

2665
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:56.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No judge.</v>

2666
02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:57.474
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2667
02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:02.780
<v Speaker 3>And I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he ran it through us like to us</v>

2668
02:05:03.091 --> 02:05:04.530
<v Speaker 3>was like a little crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2669
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:05.970
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to try to,</v>

2670
02:05:05.971 --> 02:05:07.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to try to,</v>

2671
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually input too.</v>

2672
02:05:08.851 --> 02:05:11.100
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to try to walk on Zip that</v>

2673
02:05:11.101 --> 02:05:13.180
<v Speaker 3>flies and then we importuning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2674
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that word before.</v>

2675
02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.880
<v Speaker 3>I never heard anybody use that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2676
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Cause he was saying that they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>unzip their flies potentially and then</v>

2677
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.910
<v Speaker 3>take advantage of the fact that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't say anything about it the next</v>

2678
02:05:26.911 --> 02:05:29.460
<v Speaker 3>time</v>
<v Speaker 3>to call.</v>

2679
02:05:29.490 --> 02:05:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Basically to get us to commit a minor</v>
<v Speaker 3>offense so that we,</v>

2680
02:05:33.961 --> 02:05:38.961
<v Speaker 3>or break a little rule or lead us a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit down the path and then next</v>

2681
02:05:39.451 --> 02:05:41.760
<v Speaker 3>time they would try to take their dicks</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2682
02:05:42.450 --> 02:05:45.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't call him out on having</v>

2683
02:05:45.031 --> 02:05:47.040
<v Speaker 3>his fly down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an offense.</v>

2684
02:05:47.370 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2685
02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:51.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a crime.</v>

2686
02:05:51.661 --> 02:05:53.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a rule violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2687
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>But if he's got social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

2688
02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:00.150
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll sit differently like,</v>

2689
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.190
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if someone sits there with their</v>

2690
02:06:02.191 --> 02:06:03.450
<v Speaker 3>fly open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2691
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:05.820
<v Speaker 3>and it's like this and their crotches on</v>
<v Speaker 3>display,</v>

2692
02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.830
<v Speaker 3>they're letting you know they've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>some Dick for,</v>

2693
02:06:08.831 --> 02:06:09.630
<v Speaker 3>so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2694
02:06:09.630 --> 02:06:10.171
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2695
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some Dick in here.</v>

2696
02:06:12.330 --> 02:06:17.330
<v Speaker 3>And then next time they'll be more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there's a lot of sociopath's in</v>

2697
02:06:18.481 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2698
02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:22.620
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot for a lot of people,</v>

2699
02:06:22.621 --> 02:06:26.100
<v Speaker 3>what it comes down to is the sentencing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're guilty as shit.</v>

2700
02:06:26.130 --> 02:06:28.080
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of witnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2701
02:06:28.170 --> 02:06:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not made of money.</v>

2702
02:06:30.091 --> 02:06:34.740
<v Speaker 3>So they can't pay some expert to write a</v>
<v Speaker 3>report saying that jail would hurt their</v>

2703
02:06:34.741 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 3>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they fucking do if you have money.</v>

2704
02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes down to a lot of,</v>

2705
02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to take ownership of what</v>

2706
02:06:43.411 --> 02:06:47.880
<v Speaker 3>happened and what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of sociopaths are in prison</v>

2707
02:06:47.881 --> 02:06:51.690
<v Speaker 3>because they're too stupid to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 3>how everybody else apologizes.</v>

2708
02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 3>So sociopath's will say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2709
02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that I played a part in all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this or you know,</v>

2710
02:07:01.381 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to put myself in</v>

2711
02:07:03.691 --> 02:07:05.820
<v Speaker 3>situations like this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your honor,</v>

2712
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 3>when they're being convicted of beating</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of somebody,</v>

2713
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:09.630
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to put myself in</v>

2714
02:07:09.631 --> 02:07:12.870
<v Speaker 3>situations like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like they're taking ownership,</v>

2715
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:17.520
<v Speaker 3>but put in a situation just means you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>one small part of this fucking</v>

2716
02:07:17.521 --> 02:07:22.521
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multiple aggressors and loud noises and</v>

2717
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:26.190
<v Speaker 3>rankin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2718
02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 3>and to somebody that is making the</v>
<v Speaker 3>apology,</v>

2719
02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to a room full of people that hear</v>

2720
02:07:34.201 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>nothing but apologies all day</v>

2721
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 5>we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2722
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's how,</v>

2723
02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.600
<v Speaker 5>and the judges listen for that shit very</v>
<v Speaker 5>intently.</v>

2724
02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:48.960
<v Speaker 5>There's ways to fuck up and apology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only people who fuck up,</v>

2725
02:07:49.301 --> 02:07:54.301
<v Speaker 5>the apologies in that specific way are</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost completely incapable of putting</v>

2726
02:07:55.211 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 5>themselves in anybody else's shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>those types of people.</v>

2727
02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:04.330
<v Speaker 5>And I tend to do certain types of things</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's,</v>

2728
02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 5>they're always out for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

2729
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

2730
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 5>Why does he get to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't I do that?</v>

2731
02:08:09.490 --> 02:08:12.310
<v Speaker 5>Like that Shit like that child is</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2732
02:08:12.311 --> 02:08:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Self centered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>selfish or at all.</v>

2733
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:17.500
<v Speaker 5>But they're an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just what a sociopath is.</v>

2734
02:08:17.501 --> 02:08:19.420
<v Speaker 5>It's not that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>

2735
02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:22.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking silence of the lambs or some</v>

2736
02:08:22.121 --> 02:08:23.830
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just super selfish.</v>

2737
02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Super inconsiderate of the ramifications</v>
<v Speaker 5>of their actions.</v>

2738
02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:29.500
<v Speaker 5>And they are just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

2739
02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:35.350
<v Speaker 5>they don't even know how to relate to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest of us because they don't care.</v>

2740
02:08:35.690 --> 02:08:39.120
<v Speaker 5>I don't care to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're just robots to,</v>

2741
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:42.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your experience dealing with so many</v>

2742
02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.990
<v Speaker 5>of these different people and so many</v>
<v Speaker 5>different criminals,</v>

2743
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.670
<v Speaker 5>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think it's a nature thing or a</v>

2744
02:08:45.671 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Speaker 5>nurture thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nurture.</v>

2745
02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:49.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's nurture.</v>

2746
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:52.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some,</v>

2747
02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:53.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some broken folks,</v>

2748
02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:56.620
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people are born evil.</v>

2749
02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:00.070
<v Speaker 5>You just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people are born with bad kidneys,</v>

2750
02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:02.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So some people were born like,</v>

2751
02:09:02.441 --> 02:09:04.990
<v Speaker 5>didn't they say the Jeffrey Dahmer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a good example.</v>

2752
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:09.810
<v Speaker 5>Or of a guy who allegedly had a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>stable childhood with loving parents and</v>

2753
02:09:09.811 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 5>became a serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2754
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.880
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know,</v>

2755
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:14.140
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2756
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Like they're going to say they beat the</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2757
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're going to be like,</v>

2758
02:09:17.861 --> 02:09:18.431
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2759
02:09:18.431 --> 02:09:21.700
<v Speaker 5>we did them the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Charles Manson and Ted Bundys moms did</v>

2760
02:09:21.701 --> 02:09:22.720
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2761
02:09:22.721 --> 02:09:23.620
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to say that.</v>

2762
02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:25.990
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2763
02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 5>people who do that generally have kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of similar histories.</v>

2764
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think about the way a human being</v>

2765
02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:36.010
<v Speaker 5>could vary the way we behave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be like the most beautiful,</v>

2766
02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 5>generous kind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>caring person.</v>

2767
02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:43.420
<v Speaker 5>Or you could be a brutal dictator in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Congo and chopping people's arms off.</v>

2768
02:09:43.421 --> 02:09:46.060
<v Speaker 5>And you could be either one of those is</v>
<v Speaker 5>still be a human being.</v>

2769
02:09:46.150 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you,</v>

2770
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.950
<v Speaker 5>if you think about that and you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the conditions that you have to</v>

2771
02:09:50.951 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 5>sort of adapt to and if you were growing</v>
<v Speaker 5>up at some hellacious condition,</v>

2772
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:58.210
<v Speaker 5>you adapted to that helacious condition</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is,</v>

2773
02:09:58.211 --> 02:10:01.060
<v Speaker 5>you are literally a product of society</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

2774
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:06.040
<v Speaker 5>When you come across people like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're in the criminal defense</v>

2775
02:10:06.041 --> 02:10:08.410
<v Speaker 5>attorney world and you have to represent</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>

2776
02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:12.070
<v Speaker 5>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you try to think like is there a way</v>

2777
02:10:12.071 --> 02:10:14.350
<v Speaker 5>to fix this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean do you put that in your head or</v>

2778
02:10:14.351 --> 02:10:17.260
<v Speaker 5>do you just go and try to win?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try.</v>

2779
02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I get,</v>

2780
02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:22.720
<v Speaker 5>when I would get them to do the</v>
<v Speaker 5>apologies because one of,</v>

02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could totally do that.</v>

2862
02:13:55.471 --> 02:13:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Like if I could bail him out for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I can get him to make his bail,</v>

2863
02:13:59.101 --> 02:14:03.390
<v Speaker 3>if I can get his bail low enough and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I can get him to submit job</v>

2864
02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:08.391
<v Speaker 3>applications every single week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a lie when I came up with it a</v>

2865
02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:13.710
<v Speaker 3>couple minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in six months when this case finally</v>

2866
02:14:13.711 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 3>goes in front of the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll probably have a job and they would</v>

2867
02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.010
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just think about some shit.</v>

2868
02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:22.620
<v Speaker 3>You want to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to make it true.</v>

2869
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:26.040
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe he's got to have his kids</v>

2870
02:14:26.041 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 3>back or maybe he's had to have a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with his kids,</v>

2871
02:14:28.831 --> 02:14:31.890
<v Speaker 3>which means you start right in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking letters now because in six</v>

2872
02:14:31.891 --> 02:14:36.600
<v Speaker 3>months have them show up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just cause the thing is like,</v>

2873
02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:39.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lie if you have no intention of</v>

2874
02:14:39.151 --> 02:14:41.790
<v Speaker 3>making it true and we wouldn't say in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>advance,</v>

2875
02:14:41.791 --> 02:14:43.350
<v Speaker 3>I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

2876
02:14:43.530 --> 02:14:45.180
<v Speaker 5>so do you feel like you're coaching</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys,</v>

2877
02:14:45.181 --> 02:14:49.200
<v Speaker 5>not just through their trial but maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>through their understanding of the</v>

2878
02:14:49.201 --> 02:14:52.770
<v Speaker 5>implications of their crime as well?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you in some way sort of</v>

2879
02:14:52.771 --> 02:14:54.710
<v Speaker 5>educating them and to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2880
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:56.040
<v Speaker 5>cause if they have to be honest about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2881
02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.930
<v Speaker 5>they have to kind of be maybe educated</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the impact of their choices.</v>

2882
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2883
02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to the extent that I thought it</v>

2884
02:15:04.641 --> 02:15:05.660
<v Speaker 3>was appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2885
02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:08.930
<v Speaker 3>because I'm in a position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2886
02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:12.350
<v Speaker 3>emotional abuse is not proper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2887
02:15:12.351 --> 02:15:13.184
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2888
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:15.920
<v Speaker 5>like abusing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like insulting them or something like</v>

2889
02:15:15.921 --> 02:15:16.121
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:15:16.121 --> 02:15:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Like insulting them and there's people</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you would completely want to when</v>

2891
02:15:19.521 --> 02:15:21.620
<v Speaker 5>salt them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not appropriate because</v>

2892
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:26.000
<v Speaker 5>they're such terrible monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what do you do?</v>

2893
02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:27.830
<v Speaker 5>It's you're in one of those situations.</v>

2894
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had,</v>

2895
02:15:29.690 --> 02:15:30.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2896
02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:35.540
<v Speaker 3>I've had some guys that make my skin</v>
<v Speaker 3>crawl and like I've sat next to people,</v>

2897
02:15:35.850 --> 02:15:36.683
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2898
02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:42.410
<v Speaker 5>done horrible things to people where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't make my skin crawl and yet</v>

2899
02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:46.400
<v Speaker 5>these other people are just so far</v>
<v Speaker 5>beyond them in terms of like,</v>

2900
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.480
<v Speaker 5>we don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should probably lock him up forever.</v>

2901
02:15:51.380 --> 02:15:53.720
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't do anything because you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2902
02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:55.970
<v Speaker 5>you sort of have a mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2903
02:15:55.971 --> 02:15:58.430
<v Speaker 5>You have to win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to make them beat me.</v>

2904
02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:00.463
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2905
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:02.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you drink after work?</v>

2906
02:16:02.601 --> 02:16:03.950
<v Speaker 5>Would you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2907
02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.150
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't.</v>

2908
02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you do,</v>

2909
02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.490
<v Speaker 5>then you don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were,</v>

2910
02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:12.610
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of bars right by that</v>
<v Speaker 5>courthouse.</v>

2911
02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:14.780
<v Speaker 5>But imagine you were just wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 5>escape.</v>

2912
02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you just want to booze it up.</v>

2913
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Well because the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a defense attorney,</v>

2914
02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:22.850
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get your ass handed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>you so many fucking times that if I</v>

2915
02:16:22.851 --> 02:16:26.810
<v Speaker 5>drank one time for every time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like what a judge decided,</v>

2916
02:16:27.590 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 5>I would have been dead seven ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did</v>

2917
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you get high?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2918
02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:32.510
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2919
02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Just went home pot pies and dealt with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you did stand up and you started</v>

2922
02:16:40.811 --> 02:16:42.340
<v Speaker 2>doing standup while you were an</v>
<v Speaker 2>attorney.</v>

2923
02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:43.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But you're a smart guy so I can't</v>

2925

<v Speaker 2>imagine you would suck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2928
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:53.070

<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2929
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:54.580
<v Speaker 2>talking to at the comedy store was very</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>

2930
02:16:54.581 --> 02:16:58.750
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad we did this man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just did a two and a half hours of a</v>

2931
02:16:58.751 --> 02:17:01.480
<v Speaker 2>breakdown of the criminal justice system</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2932
02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>thought and especially the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice system there and outside of</v>

2933
02:17:05.861 --> 02:17:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin.</v>

2934
02:17:06.771 --> 02:17:08.400
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2935
02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:09.910
<v Speaker 2>how long have you been doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

2936
02:17:10.290 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven years,</v>

2940
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I was in Wisconsin,</v>

2941
02:17:19.971 --> 02:17:22.310
<v Speaker 3>but I moved here in January of last</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

2942
02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like pauly shore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2944
02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Like I was a kid in the 80s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I would see Sam kinison on TV</v>

2945
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>and pauly shore on TV and everybody on</v>

2947
02:17:41.871 --> 02:17:44.270
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like pauly shore's first album is I</v>

2948
02:17:44.271 --> 02:17:46.850
<v Speaker 3>think recorded at the comedy store and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hear Ron,</v>

2949

<v Speaker 3>Jeremy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gary Coleman in the background.</v>

2950
02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Like it's nuts and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh factory doesn't hire comics,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I worked in comedy clubs before,</v>

2953
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:03.620
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey.</v>

2954
02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 3>Also the reality of it is like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>potluck is so hard to get on that Monday</v>

2955
02:18:11.091 --> 02:18:15.860
<v Speaker 3>night potluck and I had signed up every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single Monday for six months and I</v>

2956
02:18:15.861 --> 02:18:18.950
<v Speaker 3>hadn't gotten on once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2957
02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:20.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2958
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:24.350
<v Speaker 3>they put out a list saying they're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do auditions for the new door guys.</v>

2959
02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So I signed up for it so that I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>get on the potluck.</v>

2960
02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:32.850
<v Speaker 2>But then it just went really well.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Skakel me.</v>

3012
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:29.270
<v Speaker 5>I could really read the whole list,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's an amazing lineup of known and</v>

3013
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:30.104
<v Speaker 5>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3014
02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:34.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean the guy in the second to last</v>
<v Speaker 5>spot created one of the shows on NBC</v>

3015
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:37.940
<v Speaker 5>that's gone into its third season and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who's going dead last to had a</v>

3016
02:20:37.941 --> 02:20:41.290
<v Speaker 5>movie on comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>

3017
02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:42.740
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's tom embarrassed though.</v>

3018
02:20:42.741 --> 02:20:46.340
<v Speaker 5>He's an icon Stephan situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he belongs in that late,</v>

3019
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:47.660
<v Speaker 5>late spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying,</v>

3020
02:20:47.661 --> 02:20:50.030
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's how fucking pack the</v>
<v Speaker 5>lineup is insane.</v>

3021
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not just that,</v>

3022
02:20:51.501 --> 02:20:56.330
<v Speaker 5>it's also the vibe because of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the store hires all comedians like</v>

3023
02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:58.670
<v Speaker 5>yourself and like all these other ones</v>
<v Speaker 5>that work there.</v>

3024
02:20:58.671 --> 02:21:00.650
<v Speaker 5>It's like everybody is one of us.</v>

3025
02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:04.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and many guys have gone from being in</v>

3026
02:21:04.311 --> 02:21:08.270
<v Speaker 5>the position of being a doorman or work</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the cover booth or what have you to</v>

3027
02:21:08.271 --> 02:21:12.470
<v Speaker 5>being like Ari Shaffir perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Duncan trussell perfect example.</v>

3028
02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:16.160
<v Speaker 5>You know that have gone on during the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time that I've known him went from</v>

3029
02:21:16.161 --> 02:21:19.040
<v Speaker 5>starting out to being like super</v>
<v Speaker 5>headliners on the road.</v>

3030
02:21:19.041 --> 02:21:20.450
<v Speaker 5>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fascinating.</v>

3031
02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:25.780
<v Speaker 5>So there's no clubs like that where the</v>
<v Speaker 5>employees become the star attraction.</v>

3032
02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:26.893
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3033
02:21:27.380 --> 02:21:28.161
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3034
02:21:28.161 --> 02:21:30.590
<v Speaker 5>It's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only club that has like a true</v>

3035
02:21:30.591 --> 02:21:31.850
<v Speaker 5>farm system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3036
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:33.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially in the fact that that farm</v>

3037
02:21:33.891 --> 02:21:36.710
<v Speaker 5>system exists in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And granted it's not,</v>

3038
02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:40.830
<v Speaker 5>it's not that easy to get into is you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can attest and it took six months of</v>

3039
02:21:40.850 --> 02:21:45.170
<v Speaker 5>nose to fucking the lineup is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just too many people that want</v>

3040
02:21:45.171 --> 02:21:46.970
<v Speaker 5>to become comics now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

3041
02:21:46.971 --> 02:21:48.380
<v Speaker 5>Was not like that before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

3042
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:51.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know when to get up every week before</v>

3043
02:21:51.890 --> 02:21:56.240
<v Speaker 5>those to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I started in Madison in 2000</v>

3044
02:21:56.570 --> 02:22:01.070
<v Speaker 5>whenever there was like eight people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight comics,</v>

3045
02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:06.520
<v Speaker 5>and then when I left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 60 then that would sign up for</v>

3046
02:22:07.371 --> 02:22:10.040
<v Speaker 5>the funniest comedian and Madison every</v>
<v Speaker 5>single year.</v>

3047
02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3048
02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:16.340
<v Speaker 5>it's booming and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but under noon it's booming and quality</v>

3049
02:22:16.341 --> 02:22:20.260
<v Speaker 5>as well because there's an aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 5>storm and drawing.</v>

3050
02:22:20.261 --> 02:22:23.720
<v Speaker 5>Like there's only so many spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these people have to be better.</v>

3051
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 5>Like these 60,</v>

3052
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:31.220
<v Speaker 2>like you start now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to know how you are the best and</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3057
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:51.390
