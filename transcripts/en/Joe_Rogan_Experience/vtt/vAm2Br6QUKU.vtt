1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Trey my day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have this full range of</v>
<v Speaker 1>options and possibilities inside the</v>

3
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>octagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're most likely limiting yourself.</v>

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>possibilities are nice when you change</v>
<v Speaker 1>things up.</v>

7
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we said earlier,</v>

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>confused the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them thinking about something else</v>

9
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's always nice.</v>

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think right now we're seeing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pack,</v>

12
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like the standard pack of,</v>

13
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>of athletes that are doing things in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way and then there's a few that</v>

14
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:37.041
<v Speaker 1>are moving away from the pack and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're expanding the potential of MMA.</v>

15
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you're one of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>

16
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And I thank you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those coaches,</v>

17
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>and there's a few guys out there I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like to hear,</v>

18
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>but Dominick Cruz is one of them.</v>

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He's also doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>

20
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about him today that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his style is so fucking odd.</v>

21
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's technically not sound actually,</v>

22
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses it the right way is he's got</v>

23
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>awesome timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a great cardio,</v>

24
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>he's got a great Chin and then he can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with the bad things he does</v>

25
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>cause he does them for the right way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

26
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think you can say</v>

27
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>it's technically bad because he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking successful and he knows how to</v>

28
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's not standard.</v>

29
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't like we're using Ramon</v>

30
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Dekkers as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does not throw kicks and punches like</v>

31
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Ramon Dekkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he does do is he throws him</v>

32
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>like Dominick Cruz where he's moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pendulum back and forth and it's</v>

33
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>footwork is so weird and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming your mind with</v>

34
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and he doesn't do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing twice.</v>

35
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>He mixes things up so well that he's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough nut to crack.</v>

36
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's tricky.</v>

37
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>He is trickier than I expected for sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

38
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of that,</v>

39
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game planning is the talks up to the</v>

40
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>fight to get them emotionally invested</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes a bit trickier to</v>

41
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>find the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were,</v>

43
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>when you were leading up to the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking so much yet,</v>

44
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>and you could tell that you were getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>so upset,</v>

45
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but that is a big factor in fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Because fights are so emotional because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the only sports in the world</v>

47
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>where your health is on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally like this,</v>

48
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you might get in a car</v>

49
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>accident when you're racing cars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>

50
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>But the goal of MMA is for you to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>up someone's body.</v>

51
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely man.</v>

52
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I think with him too that</v>

53
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>makes it pisses you off so much is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll attack anything and just talk</v>

54
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>about some of the Disney makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to talk and talk louder and faster</v>

55
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>and not dot give you a chance to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a high school girls just like</v>

56
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>bickering at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what pisses you off the</v>

57
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:33.451
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>cause he's not even actually making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great point.</v>

59
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>He's just making it and making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>louder.</v>

60
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very articulate.</v>

61
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was good.</v>

62
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Good analyst because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>and greed technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a chance to find him again</v>

64
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're paying the line.</v>

65
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

66
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you lost a very close decision to</v>

67
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>him and then you beat hot valence son</v>
<v Speaker 1>South,</v>

68
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>which in my opinion was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this today was an</v>

69
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>excellent example of how far you</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressed because you guys had a really</v>

70
00:02:59.171 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>tough fight.</v>

71
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>The first time he fought it was a close</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

72
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.580
<v Speaker 1>This fight was not close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just ran away from him and went,</v>

73
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>ran away with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the fight rather not wearing away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

75
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.501
<v Speaker 1>but rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a clear victory.</v>

77
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just were so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>technical.</v>

78
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>There was so many more options you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting to him and he was basically</v>

79
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>the same fighter that he was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe slightly better,</v>

80
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but you're all way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

81
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate him and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've worked hard.</v>

82
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>We've worked long hours where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

83
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

85
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>the sport works out how quick things can</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

86
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be on 11 fight win streak right</v>

87
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a split decision loss to have fail</v>

88
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

89
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I won that fight,</v>

90
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>a very close fight with Dominick Cruz</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I felt I want as well.</v>

91
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Those two fights go my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on 11 fight win streak.</v>

92
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>You still have the belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>known as hopefully one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>comp pound fighters in the world,</v>

94
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we still sell stuff for sure.</v>

95
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
