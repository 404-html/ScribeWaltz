<v Speaker 1>Talk about this.</v>

4
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about this.</v>

5
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

6
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I think I can other smooshy there.</v>

8
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to go,</v>

9
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>if you want to back things up there,</v>

10
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.191
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

11
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>how fucked is that picture?</v>

12
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.600
<v Speaker 1>That picture's Walrus is sitting on a concrete floor with,</v>

13
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>with her arm through.</v>

14
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a her right with her arm through a fucking prison cage.</v>

15
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>That's so dark,</v>

16
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

17
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So the story of smooshy is,</v>

18
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>she come in from like wild caught 18 months of age,</v>

20
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.901
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds.</v>

21
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.734
<v Speaker 1>He's this big,</v>

22
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>he's a big pillow.</v>

23
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.653
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Amy.</v>

24
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.553
<v Speaker 1>She's a baby.</v>

25
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>She's not,</v>

26
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>she didn't come in alone.</v>

27
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>She comes up with some other animals,</v>

28
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>walruses where they catch them,</v>

30
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Russia and the Black Sea.</v>

31
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>So she comes in and we start then now we got to get blood from him.</v>

32
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>We got to see if these animals are healthy.</v>

33
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So the way you do it with an untrained animal,</v>

34
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you throw a big net on him,</v>

35
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>physically jumped,</v>

36
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.453
<v Speaker 1>grabbed them.</v>

37
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>The fet sticks a needle in their vet or train or someone and they go to take the</v>

38
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.474
<v Speaker 1>blood out.</v>

39
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Well during this procedure,</v>

40
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>there was another walrus there that we were doing the procedure on.</v>

41
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>And here's smooshy who's,</v>

42
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>climbing up on the other walrus.</v>

44
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's make things very difficult.</v>

45
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>He Mat,</v>

46
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>

47
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>these guys are like linebackers.</v>

48
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>So all I do is I put my hands in front of her face like this and she opened up</v>

49
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.051
<v Speaker 1>her nostrils and,</v>

50
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

51
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I remember this vividly,</v>

52
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>she took a big breath.</v>

53
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>She started to follow me.</v>

54
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.191
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

55
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I started to backup.</v>

56
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>This animal followed me,</v>

57
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>big eyes staring at me,</v>

58
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.933
<v Speaker 1>following me.</v>

59
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen anything like this before.</v>

60
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:29.844
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like,</v>

61
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be just a onetime thing.</v>

62
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>She just followed me because this just made her nervous.</v>

63
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>What had happened at 18 months of age and at that specific time was I had</v>

64
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>imprinted on her.</v>

65
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in the wild.</v>

66
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.721
<v Speaker 1>You're a mother,</v>

67
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Walrus,</v>

68
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>you shit out a calf that animal's going to tattoo to its brain,</v>

69
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>your smell,</v>

70
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.353
<v Speaker 1>your sight,</v>

71
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.373
<v Speaker 1>the sound,</v>

72
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>everything so that you can be identified in,</v>

73
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>heard of hundreds.</v>

75
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>This happened at 18 months of phases.</v>

76
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So she imprinted on you.</v>

77
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 1>Just maybe she was her,</v>

78
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you imprinted on her because she was panicking.</v>

79
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to have been,</v>

80
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>it was at that moment,</v>

81
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>and no question because I know it's the baby.</v>

82
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>While this was all going down,</v>

83
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine the stress of being caught only maybe months before</v>

84
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>separated from your mother or witnessing her mother die in a harvest.</v>

85
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

86
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So this happened.</v>

87
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>So this animal I imprinted on her.</v>

88
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Well this is,</v>

89
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>this is an anomaly.</v>

90
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't happen.</v>

91
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>

92
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.151
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

93
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:21.984
<v Speaker 1>here's food.</v>

94
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>We're like best friends now.</v>

95
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

96
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>This is your my mommy.</v>

97
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the relationship we have.</v>

98
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

99
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

100
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

101
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:33.271
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>

102
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>So then when you start factoring in the fact that she's in the pool with a lot</v>

103
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:42.261
<v Speaker 1>of crazy chlorine values and she's getting chemical burns and everything else,</v>

104
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.674
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

105
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>so you almost have a,</v>

106
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>a paternal relationship with this?</v>

107
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Definitely have.</v>

108
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I definitely have a paternal hours.</v>

109
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.523
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

110
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

111
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And all because of the fact they're not cleaning the water.</v>

112
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.200
<v Speaker 1>She's getting sick while there's more to it than that point.</v>

113
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>She come in at 2004,</v>

114
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>so she's probably 10,</v>

115
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>a little over 10 years old now.</v>

116
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>this relationship also turned into,</v>

118
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>created some problems.</v>

119
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It manifested in like,</v>

120
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>physical manifestations of stress.</v>

122
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>She developed this uncontrollable regurgitating issue where she doesn't keep her</v>

123
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:21.881
<v Speaker 1>fish down,</v>

124
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>she pukes it up and it's from anxiety,</v>

125
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>from separation anxiety because I'm fast forwarding a bit from that moment of</v>

126
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>the imprint to now or well to prior to now of course.</v>

127
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>

128
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of challenges that that relationship post.</v>

129
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>So you try to train well,</v>

130
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.880
<v Speaker 1>so I developed this,</v>

131
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>this system where the animal consumes fish and thereafter consumed Jello.</v>

132
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I would teach her to eat the Gel and play with the Jello.</v>

133
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>So try to keep her from throwing up the,</v>

134
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>the nutrients that are keeping her from gaining weight and being healthy.</v>

135
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.314
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

136
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to train all the other people on this,</v>

137
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>tried to wean myself out a number of times.</v>

139
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

140
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>so the relationship was a blessing in the fact that this is,</v>

141
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing,</v>

142
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

143
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And it was also an,</v>

144
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>and more so now like an absolute curse because giving a shit about an animal in</v>

145
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 1>that at that level,</v>

146
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.041
<v Speaker 1>like what you're saying,</v>

147
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.770
