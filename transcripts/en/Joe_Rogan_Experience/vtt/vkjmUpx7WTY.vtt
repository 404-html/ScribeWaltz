00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>You can whip those people up and get on their frequency and then there's smart</v>

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>people that can be manipulated.</v>

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>They can be manipulated once they attach themselves to an ideology.</v>

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about like people on the left that are avoiding all the</v>

7
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>craziness about Hillary.</v>

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you had a quote that I really liked that's on your Twitter.</v>

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>You know that if like Hillary was a man that had done the all the same things</v>

10
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that she like,</v>

11
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.961
<v Speaker 1>what is the quote?</v>

12
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:25.794
<v Speaker 1>What does it your exact,</v>

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

14
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>remember I said a,</v>

15
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>if Hillary was a male republican with the exact same voting record,</v>

16
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>all of her supporters would hate her with a passion.</v>

17
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

19
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's 100% sure.</v>

20
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.033
<v Speaker 1>100% true.</v>

21
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not,</v>

22
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>this is not controversial in any way,</v>

23
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

24
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Hillary is is,</v>

25
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:42.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean the stuff I was saying before,</v>

27
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.414
<v Speaker 1>but she's,</v>

28
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>she's like courting the left.</v>

29
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>She's courting people who are supposed to be liberals and you'll go,</v>

30
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>she's supported every single war of my lifetime,</v>

31
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>every single war.</v>

32
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Well now they know they can get past that.</v>

33
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>She didn't support gay marriage up until 2013 even their pet issues.</v>

34
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

36
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

37
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>she's a weird one man.</v>

38
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>She's a really,</v>

39
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>really weird one.</v>

40
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That fucking Libya thing.</v>

41
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.841
<v Speaker 1>We came,</v>

42
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.560

44
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

45
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

46
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Like are you kidding me?</v>

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that lady is fucking crazy.</v>

61
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that ladies fucking cars.</v>

62
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you're down for her.</v>

64
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

65
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>that is a completely an ideology thing.</v>

66
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

67
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

68
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>she's on your team.</v>

69
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.741
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

70
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go along with it just like it's a religion.</v>

71
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:49.944
<v Speaker 1>Just like you're,</v>

72
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you're subscribing to some predetermined thing.</v>

73
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.971
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

74
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:54.171
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

75
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.004
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

76
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>it's weird for me to see,</v>

77
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.121
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

78
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it's weird that she wants to be president.</v>

79
00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.761
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

80
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>aren't you old?</v>

81
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you're an old lady.</v>

82
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>How much energy do you have?</v>

83
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Got a ton of money.</v>

84
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>You just had your first grandkid.</v>

85
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>You've got like perspective,</v>

86
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>like what it'll you're trying to do.</v>

87
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to make history as a woman.</v>

88
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:10.584
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

89
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>do you want to just like get back at your husband for getting his Dick Sucked</v>

91
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and in 1991 or whatever the fucking was?</v>

92
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:16.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it's that.</v>

95
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:17.961
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

96
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

97
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>who knows who I,</v>

99
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in their head,</v>

101
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:26.061
<v Speaker 1>but I think these people are like power brokers that just want more and more of</v>

102
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>it and it's a real,</v>

103
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it is probably a thrill unlike anything we could imagine to have that much power</v>

104
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.611
<v Speaker 1>and they've,</v>

105
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>they've tasted a little bit of that,</v>

106
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

107
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

109
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that she's like so old that she would just want to chill,</v>

110
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

111
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

112
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

113
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>she's an old lady.</v>

114
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Like she doesn't have good health.</v>

115
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the other thing that concerned with,</v>

116
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>she had some health issues.</v>

117
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Right then she had like concussions or something.</v>

118
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>There was hit in the head.</v>

120
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>

121
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but it was to beat the fuck out of our imagine.</v>

122
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that bill just wailed on her and she wants to keep it quiet until</v>

123
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking Kot.</v>

124
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>He's been accused of violence.</v>

125
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.331
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

126
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>She has suffered from fainting spells since at least 2005 and that year she</v>

127
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Speaker 1>passed out presumably so,</v>

128
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>or while giving a speech in 2012 she passed out yet again and suffered a</v>

129
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.794
<v Speaker 1>concussion.</v>

130
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

131
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Presumably sober is something that if they ever have to say it,</v>

132
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.653
<v Speaker 1>it's just not good.</v>

133
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You got issues.</v>

135
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>We're always presumably sober.</v>

136
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not usually pursuing,</v>

137
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.701
<v Speaker 1>but all right.</v>

138
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

139
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but this idea that she fell asleep and and hit her fucking head,</v>

140
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>like when people fall and hit their head,</v>

141
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the worst things about getting knocked out is not getting punched in</v>

142
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the head.</v>

143
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's you falling down and getting hit in the head with the earth.</v>

144
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Like their,</v>

146
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>their heads bounce off the ground.</v>

147
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>That's like a big issue in street fights and stuff.</v>

148
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>When you watch someone get sucker punched,</v>

149
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they will fall down in their head,</v>

150
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>gets bounced off the curb.</v>

151
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think people who have like epilepsy and things like that,</v>

152
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>like that's the big fairly,</v>

153
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that that you end up cracking your head on the ground.</v>

154
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the seizure seizures.</v>

155
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

156
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

157
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.913
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

158
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

159
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.043
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

160
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton said recently,</v>

161
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and this would probably be one of the tactics she tries to use against Trump,</v>

162
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but she said something along the gut.</v>

163
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.021
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

164
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:11.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

166
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.231
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

167
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's the type of guy we would want having control of the nuclear</v>

168
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.024
<v Speaker 1>codes.</v>

169
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like an interesting thing to look at what your like how crazy is</v>

170
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it that any one person has control of those nuclear codes?</v>

171
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Like we're just counting on one person to not snap,</v>

172
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>to not kill the whole world to just,</v>

173
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

174
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you don't ever just like,</v>

175
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I've had enough.</v>

176
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking,</v>

177
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

178
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.451
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

179
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the cigarettes and coffee thing or the staples of the alcoholics,</v>

180
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

181
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.081
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>

183
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>a people enjoy those cigarettes and they enjoy those,</v>

185
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>those coffees,</v>

187
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

188
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>in their eyes.</v>

189
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

191
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.901
<v Speaker 1>but in their eyes,</v>

192
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they've got the alcohol part under wraps now because this stuff</v>

193
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>just kind of keeps him going and this stuff is not ruining their life.</v>

194
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

195
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Alotta alcohol,</v>

196
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>she used cannabis the same way.</v>

197
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

198
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.231
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

199
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that's not really accepted by Aa.</v>

200
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>So I know a lot,</v>

201
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:08.161
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people who have kicked their alcoholism by moving more towards</v>

202
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

203
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.843
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

204
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 2>within the gay community that they don't like that,</v>

205
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>that's still considered a drug.</v>

206
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

207
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 2>but you can get it</v>

208
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>addicted to anything,</v>

209
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 1>whether it's set porn or dig MACs or where we can get it,</v>

211
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.870
<v Speaker 1>psychologically addicted to anything.</v>

213
00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>But Jamie didn't,</v>

214
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:27.830
<v Speaker 1>the guy who created,</v>

215
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics anonymous didn't have positive experiences with LSD.</v>

217
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

218
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.560
<v Speaker 1>That'd be funny.</v>

219
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.921
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>

220
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

221
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.210
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you did acid as the only thing you're in that to take guys.</v>

222
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like,</v>

223
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.411
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

224
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.710
<v Speaker 1>that was something that happened like maybe even after.</v>

226
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

227
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

228
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak out of school.</v>

229
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 1>my right.</v>

231
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

232
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.373
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up.</v>

233
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck?</v>

235
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

236
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.980
<v Speaker 1>that's why the government needs to live testing.</v>

237
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

238
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.241
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of things.</v>

239
00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:57.074
<v Speaker 2>So we know.</v>

240
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.933
<v Speaker 1>Scroll that up please.</v>

241
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Alcoholics anonymous foe a founder believed LSD could cure alcoholism.</v>

242
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.333
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

243
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 4>You've seen so much research now in psychedelics that clinics are opening up.</v>

244
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 4>There's a clinic in,</v>

245
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 4>in La for,</v>

246
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.073
<v Speaker 4>for Acadamin,</v>

247
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

248
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.910
<v Speaker 4>and you're seeing NDNA clinics opening up.</v>

249
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.891
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

250
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Most of them do not realize that the program's cofounder,</v>

251
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:23.951
<v Speaker 4>Bill Wilson credited the psychedelic drugs LSD for alleviating his alcoholism</v>

252
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 4>and believe the drug could be used to treat others as well.</v>

253
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.293
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

254
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 4>So those friends of bill,</v>

255
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 4>they didn't get all the information [inaudible] of bill.</v>

256
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 4>If you're in the alcoholics anonymous,</v>

257
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:37.221
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

258
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.031
<v Speaker 4>That's what they call themselves.</v>

259
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.691
<v Speaker 4>Like Ken's a bill.</v>

260
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like the code w but they didn't get that experience.</v>

261
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like the mushrooms,</v>

262
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 4>like quitting cigarettes.</v>

263
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

264
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 4>But do you think they tell them,</v>

265
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I never heard this before today.</v>

266
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 4>How could you not tell these people?</v>

267
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.390
<v Speaker 4>Wilson first became,</v>

268
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

269
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 4>began experimenting with Lsd in Los Angeles at the Veterans Administration back</v>

270
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 4>in 1956.</v>

271
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 4>But after taking his first hit of acid,</v>

272
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 4>he realized that it was not the aspect of terror that could help remedy</v>

273
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:05.211
<v Speaker 4>alcoholism,</v>

274
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:10.211
<v Speaker 4>but rather the insight one could attain from stepping into a world of simulated</v>

275
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 4>insanity.</v>

276
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.270
<v Speaker 4>And whoa.</v>

277
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Wilson believe that using the LSD could help the alcoholic discover a power</v>

278
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 4>greater than ourselves that in turn could restore us to sanity.</v>

279
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.151
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

280
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 4>he was adamant that using acid to combat the demons of alcoholism was not</v>

281
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 4>something that he could,</v>

282
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 4>that one could expect from a single dose.</v>

283
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 4>He's like more research is required and snacks.</v>

284
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.623
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

285
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

286
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.221
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting,</v>

287
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

288
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.331
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

289
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:38.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

290
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:39.141
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics,</v>

291
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I think as we experiment within,</v>

292
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 4>like medically,</v>

293
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 4>I going to reveal some secrets.</v>

294
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.201
<v Speaker 4>This guy's,</v>

295
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.720
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a heavy duty tripper.</v>

296
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 4>They're going further down.</v>

297
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 4>He was tripping with Aldous Huxley.</v>

298
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy.</v>

299
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like one experience he had.</v>

300
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

301
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 4>There's documentation that indicates Wilson was involved with many supervise LSD</v>

302
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:02.474
<v Speaker 4>trials,</v>

303
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 4>including some with psychology,</v>

304
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 4>a psychologist,</v>

305
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Betty Eisner and brave new world author,</v>

306
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Aldous Huxley,</v>

307
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 4>which led them to believe that the visions and insights given by l LSD could</v>

308
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 4>create a large incentive,</v>

309
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 4>at least in a considerable number of people.</v>

310
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.150
<v Speaker 4>And so this was with like a leader,</v>

311
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 4>and in fact,</v>

312
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 4>they lift the left this out of the AA pamphlet.</v>

313
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.430
<v Speaker 4>How do they,</v>

314
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 4>how could they leave this out?</v>

315
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:27.591
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

316
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:32.591
<v Speaker 4>Cause this seems like this had to play a major part in this guy's ability to</v>

317
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 4>kick alcohol</v>

318
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
