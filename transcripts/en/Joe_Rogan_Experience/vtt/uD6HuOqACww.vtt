28
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.541
<v Speaker 2>like this big fleshy thing and you tuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>it inside of you and then you pull it </v>

29
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.261
<v Speaker 2>out slowly and it feels really good.</v>

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:19.261
<v Speaker 2>vagina and it's the second use of the </v>

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but you want to make sure you don't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing in there because it </v>

32

124
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.581
<v Speaker 4>the word nootropics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best way to get information </v>

125
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.371
<v Speaker 4>on it and try a bunch of different stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>out before you ever even think about </v>

126
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 4>buying Alpha brain research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nootropics getting,</v>

127
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 4>get involved in looking at what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

128
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of studies about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

129
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them were done on people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's.</v>

130
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

131
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.450
<v Speaker 4>people whose brains weren't functioning </v>

132
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.571
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Various companies have a nootropic </v>

133
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 4>formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't necessarily go out and buy Alpha </v>

134
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.821
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you that we use it and </v>

135
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:47.821
<v Speaker 4>then it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

136
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.630

<v Speaker 4>you order it and it doesn't work for </v>

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.630
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't even have to return it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragons came.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a troll who came over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain with a battleaxe and came into </v>

145
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>town and took all the Algebra and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on Ebay or something.</v>

155
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't promote them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Women don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the things that he's </v>

184
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.500
<v Speaker 5>playing a practical joke on me right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

185
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 5>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is going to sound totally </v>

186
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know how guys will sometimes get</v>

187
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 5>divorced and the woman will get half a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy shit and then people will say,</v>

188
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fucked up that she never told a </v>

189
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 5>joke or she never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

190
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 5>made one point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

191
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:30.511
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck did she get half his money?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the combination of people sometimes </v>

192
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.910
<v Speaker 5>sometimes a woman will come into your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life and she's such a bad ass bitch and </v>

193
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.400
<v Speaker 5>you want to impress her so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will be a better person.</v>

194
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the flip side of that is I think</v>

195
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:46.891
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what chicks do not me know when you </v>

196
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:48.790
<v Speaker 5>start dating somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'll just like,</v>

197
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm the.</v>

198
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm like super cool new girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just sweep the crazy end of the rug for </v>

199
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 5>a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

200
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 5>you don't need to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to meet my mom,</v>

201
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 5>who I'm becoming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

202
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

203
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 5>the truth comes out eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you're like the best version</v>

204
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 5>of yourself at first and then you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>

205
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:11.031
<v Speaker 5>But that's why I always tell the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be the you who you're </v>

206
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:11.031
<v Speaker 5>pretending to be when you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get laid.</v>

207
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 5>If you do that day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that day,</v>

208
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 5>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be that guy.</v>

209
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 5>It is possible to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking hard to decide and work on.</v>

210
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 5>It might be the you that you pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be when you're trying to get laid.</v>

211
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 5>I think vitamin D or something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to do squats,</v>

212

<v Speaker 5>70 pounders.</v>

215
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 5>You've got to really work the spine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the core,</v>

216
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 5>all that is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta keep your core engaged.</v>

217
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My inner core.</v>

218

<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot going on here.</v>

223
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.450
<v Speaker 5>This is the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You feel the same way.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's a lot going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's not bad,</v>

226
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.630
<v Speaker 5>but I know that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is so ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I know what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get you pictures of you in the </v>

<v Speaker 5>sightings sightings.</v>

231
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 5>The attacks are usually on dogs and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of rabbits get fucked up and the </v>

232
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 5>occasional deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they catch a deer,</v>

233
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 5>they'll basically fuck up anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they try to avoid people as much as </v>

234
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.711
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's really weird that they've seen </v>

235
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 5>for or at least one four times in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>course of it might be the same one.</v>

236
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Most likely you ever watched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I survived and the mountain lion one's </v>

237
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 5>really fucked me up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like they scalp you,</v>

238
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 5>they're horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so dangerous.</v>

239
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 5>You don't even have any idea of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong they are when you see one.</v>

240
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 5>There was one when I was in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a stuffed one like this.</v>

241
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 5>They have this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a wildlife exhibit place where,</v>

242
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:07.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

243
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.840
<v Speaker 5>there was this guy taking care of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these different tigers that were </v>

244
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 5>from zoos and all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like a big,</v>

245
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 5>huge area filled with big cats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they had a stuffed mountain lion and</v>

246
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 5>it was like 200 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hundred 50,</v>

247
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 5>200 pounds.</v>

248
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at the dimensions,</v>

249
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.610
<v Speaker 5>that's what it freaks you out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see the width of its paws.</v>

250
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.620
<v Speaker 5>It's wrist is like twice the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>man's.</v>

251
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 5>There are enormous risks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you look at the bones of the </v>

252
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 5>pause and you look at the fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of it designed to fuck shit up.</v>

253
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Big Cat as big as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is essentially what it is.</v>

254
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a big man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a cat.</v>

255
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 5>Two hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking the one I saw and I survived.</v>

256
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.630
<v Speaker 5>The woman was trying to save.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Her husband had the and she was jamming </v>

257
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 5>a pen into the mountain lions and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't even reacting.</v>

258
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

259
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.180
<v Speaker 5>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

260
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to break that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you scared to be outside of your </v>

261
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 5>house?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I pack heat.</v>

262
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 5>You know what I do when I go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the Times I go outside to take a</v>

263
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 5>leak just to put my mark around the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

264
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.560
<v Speaker 5>That's not weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In my underwear with a gun in my </v>

265
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 5>underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just tucked the gun in my underwear.</v>

266
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.900
<v Speaker 2>See I just pooping little coffee cans </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside my house and then they just put </v>

267
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:26.900
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

268
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 5>We should have more secrets for me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>start now.</v>

269
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.090
<v Speaker 5>It'll just be a job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really walk around.</v>

270
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm just fucking around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I did when I was hiking in Colorado.</v>

271
00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:43.721
<v Speaker 5>I did always use to bring on just for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that very reason just for the mountain </v>

272
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:44.660
<v Speaker 5>lion reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most likely it never happens,</v>

273
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:46.070
<v Speaker 5>but fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it does happen,</v>

274
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:47.700
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't it be nice to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shoot that count,</v>

275
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.900
<v Speaker 5>those posters that say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just make yourself bigger,</v>

276
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 5>but you got to do something wild killer </v>
<v Speaker 5>is looking at you.</v>

277
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to throw my friend at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lion and I'll go get help or </v>

278
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 5>playing dead me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just push the south park.</v>

279
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.060
<v Speaker 5>When the actors had to save the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>record,</v>

280
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.070
<v Speaker 5>it was just human shield.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

281

<v Speaker 5>mountain lions eating your asshole.</v>

282
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.330

<v Speaker 2>That thing we talked about a while back </v>

283
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:32.330
<v Speaker 2>where I said if you ever get attacked by</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lion,</v>

284
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I would take like a piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to throw it.</v>

285
00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was a real cat and you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

286
00:13:35.451 --> 00:13:36.350

<v Speaker 2>documentary of this guy and you've </v>

288
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.360
<v Speaker 2>actually seen it before where he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>really close to dig this.</v>

289
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this line is male lion and this girl </v>

290
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.521
<v Speaker 2>lion and he's holding a toilet paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll and the whole time he's just </v>

291
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.000
<v Speaker 2>holding it like in his right hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then like at the cat starts coming up to</v>

292
00:13:53.001 --> 00:13:53.820
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

293
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.840
<v Speaker 2>like about the throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toilet paper roll and the cat just </v>

294
00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:58.840
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks over to the right and like,</v>

295
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like just like jerking off the cat right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

296
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Just kinda know.</v>

297
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.440
<v Speaker 2>But then at one point like he got really</v>
<v Speaker 2>close and the,</v>

298
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was going to use that to </v>

299
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 2>throw it in the opposite direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that that would be like his only</v>

300
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 2>chance to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that little toilet paper.</v>

301
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I could find the video,</v>

302
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to find out if anyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about.</v>

303
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>If I was to distract him with toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

304
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

305
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 2>we have to watch this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope somebody tweets me because you'll</v>

306
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 2>freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

307
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Because they've never seen anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>it before.</v>

308
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's because then their instincts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their instincts are still a cat.</v>

309
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Like where live you throw anything out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cat,</v>

310
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be like,</v>

311
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.140
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's that?</v>

312
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 5>We should kill all caps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love my cats and everything,</v>

313
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 5>but I know the only reason why I love </v>
<v Speaker 5>them is because of the size difference.</v>

314
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm way bigger than him.</v>

315
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 5>She wanted to fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If she wanted to fuck around and try to </v>

316
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 5>kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could snap her neck.</v>

317
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes you love something.</v>

318
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

319
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 3>That's why she loves me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm big enough,</v>

320
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.980
<v Speaker 3>but if the roles were reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cat would eat me.</v>

321
00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

322
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Should have cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

<v Speaker 5>when you've got a ponytail.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of this thing.</v>

348
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.780
<v Speaker 5>It gets intense here for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

349
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.450
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't even need this creepy music </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's just intense.</v>

350
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.160
<v Speaker 5>That is a big killer.</v>

351
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.810
<v Speaker 5>A big wild killer flips its tail around </v>
<v Speaker 5>sign that he was.</v>

352
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 5>My potential danger remains both </v>
<v Speaker 5>threatening with that line or that dude.</v>

353
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:38.940
<v Speaker 5>I think I'll take my chances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

354
00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:41.130
<v Speaker 5>this is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine that?</v>

355
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Look at the size of its arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look at that thing.</v>

356
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.220
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's horrifying.</v>

357
00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of that thing,</v>

358
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.540
<v Speaker 5>looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my 600 pound fucking monster,</v>

359
00:16:54.541 --> 00:16:59.541

<v Speaker 5>Africa at Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

360
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.840
<v Speaker 5>The second line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>second line,</v>

361
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:05.970
<v Speaker 5>second line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the back of,</v>

362
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.780
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

363
00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:14.500

<v Speaker 5>This guy in Narnia beyond the limits.</v>

364
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is fucking up here.</v>

365
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.230
<v Speaker 5>This is where it gets fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy,</v>

366
00:17:19.231 --> 00:17:20.910
<v Speaker 5>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't seem scared.</v>

367
00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 5>Is he just that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stoned?</v>

368
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put my bags and he's on meds.</v>

369
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Just dropped him in a field or a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>luck.</v>

370
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Here's a ball of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing like,</v>

371
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.490
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like a fucking werewolf movie.</v>

372
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

373
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This insane.</v>

374
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 5>It's walking away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

375
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 2>And then that is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

376
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.570
<v Speaker 2>I walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

377
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

378
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 2>so my paper theory is totally legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

379
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Brian read bids theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're getting attacked by a </v>

380
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 2>tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some paper,</v>

381
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 2>crinkle in the ball and then it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it attacks you,</v>

382
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:16.130
<v Speaker 2>just like you're going to throw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

383
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>is it the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotion of it?</v>

384
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Like you're throwing something white and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what the fuck it is.</v>

385
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a hack into the brain </v>

386
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 2>of a cat or a feline that for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>

387
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 2>they they that crinkly noise that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ball,</v>

388
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 2>that what's the in your hand type thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know what it is,</v>

389
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>so it's just spazzes out like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck this.</v>

390
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.850
<v Speaker 2>So lucky cats are stupid as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so lucky.</v>

391
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Toilet paper distracts them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

392
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 2>that was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those things.</v>

393
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.560
<v Speaker 2>We need those shitty blurry youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>style video who still absolutely </v>

394
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be an hd version of that.</v>

395
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

396
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:57.981

<v Speaker 2>A male lion and it's off the road.</v>

397
00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Is it the animal planet?</v>

398
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.750
<v Speaker 4>So it was like an animal planet DVD </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's available.</v>

399
00:19:01.751 --> 00:19:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Versus what it says,</v>

400
00:19:03.731 --> 00:19:08.731
<v Speaker 4>man vs wild pride and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's reverses wild prod Jesus Christ.</v>

401
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.940
<v Speaker 4>I want to know that guys deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude who's taken.</v>

402
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

403
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.790
<v Speaker 4>he's another one of those dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those wild.</v>

404
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get close to animal dudes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been popping up a lot lately.</v>

405
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.210
<v Speaker 2>We should really say rest in peace if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>is dead because he's probably as.</v>

406
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 2>That looks like an old video and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that kind of shit.</v>

407
00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:28.960
<v Speaker 2>He's probably not even alive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on his last leg</v>

408
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.080
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess Steve Irwin Sorta started that </v>

409
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.080
<v Speaker 4>all off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

410
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.460
<v Speaker 4>because he was like real wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The crocodile hunter dude.</v>

411
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.860
<v Speaker 4>He would get like right up to him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

412
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.900
<v Speaker 4>And what was the one with the black </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear?</v>

413
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.070
<v Speaker 4>What was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

414
00:19:43.071 --> 00:19:46.580
<v Speaker 4>grizzly man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a brown bear was.</v>

415
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brown bears are the big ones.</v>

416
00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 4>Have Black bears out that dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>black bears are.</v>

417
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.450
<v Speaker 4>They don't really attack people as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>or kill people as much.</v>

418
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Speaker 4>It's the bigger bears and brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

419
00:19:56.301 --> 00:20:01.301
<v Speaker 4>He was that dude who lives in Alaska and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said that he was essentially death </v>

420
00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:02.900
<v Speaker 4>by bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he suicided himself.</v>

421
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 4>He wanted to do that as suicide by bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just stayed late,</v>

422
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's supposed to be there.</v>

423
00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:12.731
<v Speaker 4>The bears that are awake are super </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous because they can't kill </v>

424
00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:12.731
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're not fat enough to hibernate,</v>

425
00:20:12.731 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

426
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.120
<v Speaker 4>And so they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll eat anything.</v>

427
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:15.670
<v Speaker 4>They eat babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were eating babies,</v>

428
00:20:15.671 --> 00:20:20.671
<v Speaker 4>so he caught the meeting babies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still stuck around for a girl.</v>

429
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.080
<v Speaker 4>I always think about his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

430
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.580
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She died after she tried to help him.</v>

431
00:20:28.581 --> 00:20:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the video is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a cap over the camera,</v>

432
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:36.800
<v Speaker 4>but the audio is there of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>event and it's like six minutes long.</v>

433
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he only played like the very </v>

434
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.240
<v Speaker 4>beginning of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

435
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't play any of the audio of the</v>

436
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.350
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The in the,</v>

437
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 4>in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his ex wife or his ex girlfriend,</v>

438
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is listening to it.</v>

439
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:56.070
<v Speaker 4>She's listening to the audio and she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one who decides at her and Werner </v>

440
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Herzog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

441
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who's director,</v>

442
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 4>they decided not to release it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a long audio too.</v>

443
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears don't kill you.</v>

444
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 4>They just eat</v>

445
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 5>and eventually you die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a completely different deal than a </v>

446
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.311
<v Speaker 5>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're way better off getting killed by </v>

447
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:12.311
<v Speaker 5>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cats,</v>

448
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:12.311
<v Speaker 5>cats kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

449
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 5>they kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first thing I'm going to do is grab </v>

450
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 5>a hold of your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they gonna kill you.</v>

451
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.470
<v Speaker 5>That's their instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harris just hold you and start eating.</v>

452
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:25.100
<v Speaker 5>Was there any proof that the wife of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that bear dude didn't have a penis,</v>

453
00:21:25.101 --> 00:21:25.400

<v Speaker 4>the desire to stay in the closet is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>

464
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.330
<v Speaker 4>It leads to be so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're willing to go live with,</v>

465

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he had this whole thing always </v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm protecting these bears.</v>

467
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.110
<v Speaker 5>Does the forest department want to help </v>
<v Speaker 5>them now?</v>

468
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.210

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 5>And he was like yelling and screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the camera and point at them and then he</v>

471
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 5>would</v>

472

478
00:22:18.631 --> 00:22:23.631
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was eight and he had this </v>

479
00:22:23.631 --> 00:22:23.631
<v Speaker 4>crazy thing where he was like walking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holding the camera,</v>

480
00:22:23.631 --> 00:22:24.630
<v Speaker 4>talking about if he was just gay,</v>

481
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 5>if I was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I could just go to.</v>

491
00:22:46.971 --> 00:22:50.030
<v Speaker 5>To pretend your whole life to be one </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing when you really.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They can't even actually consummate.</v>

511
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

512
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.260
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

513
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.060
<v Speaker 4>they just start twitching and coming on </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

514
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Great to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like</v>

515
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.090
<v Speaker 5>picturing bird's family,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Don't worry anybody's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This craziness in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're ready for anything.</v>

519
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.450
<v Speaker 5>It's probably best for him that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>running the house.</v>

520
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if he were in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house?</v>

521
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

522
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 5>I could just picture those girls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Making them dress up for a tea party.</v>

523
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.420

<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he does.</v>

524
00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:14.421
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do all this stuff when you </v>

525
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:14.421
<v Speaker 4>have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bert Kreischer,</v>

526
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:15.130
<v Speaker 4>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's uh,</v>

527
00:24:15.131 --> 00:24:20.131
<v Speaker 4>another one of those dudes that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Internet is perfect for,</v>

528
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people get to see the.</v>

529
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.480
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you get your hero,</v>

530
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.910
<v Speaker 5>like when he's on podcasts,</v>

<v Speaker 5>if he's doing let him or something,</v>

534
00:24:31.711 --> 00:24:33.780
<v Speaker 5>he's always hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he stuck to like seven minutes.</v>

535
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 5>He can get to really know them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The experience to Albert Christchurch </v>

536
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 5>brands.</v>

537
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.210
<v Speaker 4>Amy Schumer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long have you been doing comedy?</v>

538
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Seven and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

539
00:24:44.761 --> 00:24:46.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did that Charlie Sheen Bros.</v>

540
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.780
<v Speaker 4>And that's when I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

541
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.190
<v Speaker 4>that's when I found out about you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heArd your name before.</v>

542
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.620
<v Speaker 4>People say you really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to pull your head up.</v>

543
00:24:53.621 --> 00:24:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go.</v>

544
00:24:57.161 --> 00:24:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

545
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.850
<v Speaker 4>guys always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then someone will have </v>

546
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:02.850
<v Speaker 4>this conversation when you see like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really funny check,</v>

547
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

548
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.540
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's another one.</v>

549
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 4>So because you know how it is with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

550
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

551
00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:12.940
<v Speaker 4>there's lIke I'd say dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard enough to do comedy,</v>

552
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 4>to be a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to be a woman just to,</v>

553
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.900
<v Speaker 4>to get over this societal boundary of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you being the one talking,</v>

554
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.730
<v Speaker 4>I think it's way more difficult for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

555
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it's weighed more difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

556
00:25:23.771 --> 00:25:28.771
<v Speaker 4>especially meatheads and insecure guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>to accept the fact that a woman's </v>

557
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:33.211
<v Speaker 4>onstage talking and then your subject </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter is obviously going to be more </v>

558
00:25:33.211 --> 00:25:34.780
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say more restrictive,</v>

559
00:25:34.781 --> 00:25:37.990
<v Speaker 4>but it's more difficult for you to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>out certain things,</v>

560
00:25:37.991 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 4>especially sexual stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

561
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:43.030
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certain things about judgments and,</v>

562
00:25:43.031 --> 00:25:48.031
<v Speaker 4>and politics because people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>reluctant to take the opinion of a </v>

563
00:25:48.031 --> 00:25:48.031
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

564
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.910
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way harder I think for a chIck to,</v>

565
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 4>to make it and be a standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a bad motherfucker come </v>

566
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 4>along like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

567
00:25:57.551 --> 00:25:59.750
<v Speaker 4>I always get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always very impressed because um,</v>

568
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I know that it's harder for a woman to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do than a man.</v>

569
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.500
<v Speaker 4>And when I heard john and charlie sheen </v>
<v Speaker 4>row,</v>

570
00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:05.440
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit,</v>

571
00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:09.490
<v Speaker 4>this chicken is fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had some really funny lines.</v>

572
00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

573
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I generally a like a lot of times </v>

574
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 4>roasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

575
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:16.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

576
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.130
<v Speaker 4>You're just being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're being mean to each other.</v>

577
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it's funny and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

578
00:26:19.721 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like some weird,</v>

579
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:21.220

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.520
<v Speaker 5>shit that guy's been storing about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

581
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.230
<v Speaker 5>You know It's gross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

582
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.980
<v Speaker 4>The way you did it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fucking exchange.</v>

583
00:26:28.981 --> 00:26:31.680
<v Speaker 4>You've got him with Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we play that?</v>

584
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Can we play that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to play that.</v>

585
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:36.240
<v Speaker 4>If we can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we could find it.</v>

586
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.560
<v Speaker 4>If brian could find it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll put it up.</v>

587
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Because it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike tyson was trying to go back and </v>

588
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 4>forth with you and you just handled him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You handled</v>

589
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike tyson used to beat a boxer.</v>

590
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.830
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like when I watched that,</v>

591
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.540
<v Speaker 3>that was like in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

592
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.430
<v Speaker 3>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just happened.</v>

593
00:26:55.431 --> 00:26:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Like I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

594
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.930
<v Speaker 3>he just manhandled Mike Tyson in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>verbal,</v>

595
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:03.710
<v Speaker 3>in the white girl bubble enough still to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

596
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.750
<v Speaker 3>he won't come over here like I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a.</v>

597
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 3>But it was like afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

598
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't assume that.</v>

599
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Take a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's away calmer version of Mike </v>

600
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Tyson and he was back in his fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

601
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's a scary guy.</v>

602
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 3>Was still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

603
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:27.081
<v Speaker 3>there were some uncomfortable moments </v>
<v Speaker 3>still where you like Pretend to be like </v>

604
00:27:27.081 --> 00:27:27.081
<v Speaker 3>he was gonna hit someone and you're </v>

<v Speaker 3>but you will.</v>

606
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:31.080
<v Speaker 3>They'll laugh at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

607
00:27:31.081 --> 00:27:36.081
<v Speaker 3>If he has least fake punches at people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will laugh to out of uncomfort </v>

608
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:37.030
<v Speaker 3>and no one's going to be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what michael,</v>

609
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 3>that makes me uncomfortable crossing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>line mind.</v>

610
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:41.970
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you used to be a professional fighter,</v>

611
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to talk about my boundaries.</v>

612
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

613
00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you just have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

614
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:51.291
<v Speaker 3>that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to leave a couple minutes </v>

615
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:51.291
<v Speaker 3>early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them grab your dick.</v>

616
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 3>He grabbed my dick the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta let them,</v>

617
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.220
<v Speaker 3>as long as he's not squeezing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>squeezing it,</v>

618
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 3>and then you might want to call them</v>

619
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.870
<v Speaker 6>nothing but now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

620
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 6>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>afterwards I was like,</v>

621
00:28:00.321 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe that just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he did a great job.</v>

622
00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 6>I think he did even better than what </v>
<v Speaker 6>they made it look like.</v>

623
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.620
<v Speaker 6>The wrIters are all kind of sweating if </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was going to be able to deliver.</v>

624
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.940
<v Speaker 6>But I thought he like nailed it.</v>

625
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

626
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 4>what did you think that he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to do?</v>

627
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:14.810
<v Speaker 4>You just thought,</v>

628
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.710
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

629
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.500
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know the writers who had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>working with him were kind of like,</v>

630
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.660
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we hope he was like the wild card.</v>

631
00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:25.661
<v Speaker 6>Like he might just bug out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like say be completely incoherent </v>

632
00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:30.190
<v Speaker 6>because they had like a concept for him </v>
<v Speaker 6>that he was going to speak really </v>

633
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.930
<v Speaker 6>intelligently and spout poetry and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

634
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.030
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he did a great job.</v>

635
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he used,</v>

636
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.050
<v Speaker 4>that's what he mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a weird sort of a,</v>

637
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 4>a kind of almost like a ghetto </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosopher when he was a young guy </v>

638
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.840
<v Speaker 4>because he would like mess up words and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

639
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:48.740
<v Speaker 4>but he would quote you all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy things like he was,</v>

640
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.070
<v Speaker 4>he's a scholar on boxing history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

641
00:28:52.071 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 4>and when he was a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't a,</v>

642
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.030
<v Speaker 4>an inarticulate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

643
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much has changed,</v>

644
00:28:58.191 --> 00:29:01.800
<v Speaker 4>but there's an inevitable decline in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to function after getting</v>

645
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.190
<v Speaker 3>punched you in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

646
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.100
<v Speaker 3>It's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount,</v>

647
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount you eat and no one wants </v>

648
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.200
<v Speaker 3>to admit that or accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that is a fact.</v>

649
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.490
<v Speaker 6>To be totally honest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt the only sort of remorse I felt </v>

650
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.940
<v Speaker 6>that night was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was for him because it was like,</v>

651
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.300
<v Speaker 6>he's for sure brain damaged and it felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

652
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you fucking had to do what you </v>

653
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.941
<v Speaker 3>had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl with crocodiles and you poked in </v>

654
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:32.080
<v Speaker 3>the eyes and ran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't see me coming.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fucking body spray or the site.</v>

665
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it because they want to sell more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dvds?</v>

666
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to add stuff,</v>

667
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but they probably have a month somewhere</v>

<v Speaker 1>deep under commercial,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so dumb.</v>

670
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

671
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:11.260

672
00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 1>the more people would watch those </v>
<v Speaker 1>roasts.</v>

673
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If 100 million people watched the video,</v>

839
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.830
<v Speaker 3>because of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men go blank.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've dated guys and I've been the </v>

842
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.110
<v Speaker 3>one in a couple of relationships where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was always initiating sex.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm getting excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

848
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.010

<v Speaker 3>I feel driven by sex.</v>

850
00:37:53.651 --> 00:37:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you're driven by success?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to get sex?</v>

851
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.220
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

852
00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:01.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not driven by success.</v>

853
00:38:01.401 --> 00:38:04.160
<v Speaker 3>I feel like sexually driven like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the time.</v>

854
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:09.400
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is getting laid,</v>

856
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.980
<v Speaker 3>most likely that's just getting laid </v>
<v Speaker 3>like comes razor you would,</v>

857
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but you would think that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to send a message to you.</v>

858
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm the headliner</v>

859
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 3>loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like very.</v>

860
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Everything he did that weekend was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really annoying.</v>

861
00:38:26.511 --> 00:38:31.511
<v Speaker 3>Like he was trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would like take his coffee on stage </v>

862
00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:32.420
<v Speaker 3>and do a lot of crowd work and just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>stick around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to enjoy amy.</v>

866
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.450

<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

867
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.450
<v Speaker 6>Doing a lot of crowd work.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was his way of saying I'm the head.</v>

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he was saying like I should be </v>

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.090
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>expectation wise on the road.</v>

<v Speaker 4>how is he doing this?</v>

912
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.980
<v Speaker 4>You say you feel like when a guy does </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

913
00:40:18.981 --> 00:40:23.981
<v Speaker 4>he does this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't like respect to would a male </v>

914
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:23.981
<v Speaker 4>comic,</v>

915
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:27.060
<v Speaker 6>like I would like to be treated like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>comic,</v>

916
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.700
<v Speaker 6>like you would treat the headlining </v>
<v Speaker 6>comic while I'm on the road.</v>

917
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.070
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they treat me like a,</v>

918
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.130
<v Speaker 6>like a girl and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and guys are confused like how they </v>

<v Speaker 6>usually are with chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what,</v>

920
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.070
<v Speaker 6>how they treat me.</v>

921
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.190
<v Speaker 6>the headliner that weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just speaking to me like I'm working </v>

922
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.270
<v Speaker 6>with you rather than like throwing me </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything</v>

923
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 4>and you're not even trying to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominate them.</v>

924
00:40:49.961 --> 00:40:52.960
<v Speaker 4>You just don't try to dominate you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want them just getting weird.</v>

925
00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

926
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just want them to treat me like </v>

927
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.310
<v Speaker 6>normally and like they would treat any </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedian</v>

928
00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.690
<v Speaker 4>because there's some comics who won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even share a green room with,</v>

929
00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:03.120
<v Speaker 4>wIth the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle and the opening act.</v>

930
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Like they'll,</v>

931
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.710
<v Speaker 6>it might get to that point just because </v>
<v Speaker 6>of how much like bullshit.</v>

1085
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.980
<v Speaker 6>a whereas people in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if there's like an old rich mean </v>

1086
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.840

1089
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not everybody,</v>

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:51.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my best friends live out here.</v>

1091
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.990
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they're not like that,</v>

1092
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:53.280
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1093
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll do.</v>

1094
00:47:54.531 --> 00:47:56.750
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of people that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter,</v>

1095
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.180
<v Speaker 4>the higher percentage of them are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

1096
00:47:59.181 --> 00:48:00.740
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1097
00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:02.720
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like angry going into any </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant.</v>

1098
00:48:02.721 --> 00:48:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone's looking around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1099
00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:08.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just a totally different vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's all of the people.</v>

1100
00:48:08.361 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1101
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I say about cops,</v>

1102
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.130
<v Speaker 4>like most cops are cool as fuck I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1103
00:48:13.131 --> 00:48:17.450
<v Speaker 4>the cops that I run into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most cops are good guys that are working</v>

1104
00:48:17.451 --> 00:48:20.060
<v Speaker 4>on really tough job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a certaIn percentage,</v>

1105
00:48:20.061 --> 00:48:21.440
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one or two percent,</v>

1106
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:26.441
<v Speaker 4>10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And will you make the number up where </v>

1107
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:26.441
<v Speaker 4>they're just fucking cunts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just constant.</v>

1108
00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:27.860
<v Speaker 4>But there would be concept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were construction workers.</v>

1109
00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.080
<v Speaker 4>They would be counted if they worked at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the grocery store.</v>

1110
00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.180
<v Speaker 4>They just shitty human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think the percentage for la is.</v>

1111
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because of the fact that this is a </v>

1112
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 4>magnet for people that want showbiz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fame,</v>

1113
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:39.830
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1114
00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I can tell many people that come here </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a pr,</v>

1115
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.210
<v Speaker 4>not a real dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

1116
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:45.830
<v Speaker 4>well I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1117
00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:47.780
<v Speaker 4>and it's like they don't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1118
00:48:47.781 --> 00:48:52.781
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they came here initially to become </v>

1119
00:48:52.781 --> 00:48:52.781
<v Speaker 4>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1120
00:48:52.781 --> 00:48:54.530
<v Speaker 4>you'll meet them at flower stores,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll meet them in this,</v>

1121
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 4>this women people</v>

1122
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.360
<v Speaker 6>like I don't like those people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>

1123
00:48:57.361 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have like a weird,</v>

1124
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1125
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.680
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I want from this stuff is I'm </v>

1126
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.850
<v Speaker 6>confused by it because getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>recognized and all that stuff is not.</v>

1127
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.700
<v Speaker 6>I haven't experienced it as being fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like,</v>

1128
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.790
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten upgraded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes there's perks,</v>

1129
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:20.060
<v Speaker 6>but I like anonymity in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one gives a shit if you are the most </v>

1130
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.411
<v Speaker 6>famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like you can ride around the </v>

1131
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:24.411
<v Speaker 6>subway and people generally leave you </v>
<v Speaker 6>alone.</v>

1132
00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:26.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm jew because nobody gives a shit </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1133
00:49:26.701 --> 00:49:28.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just like it more there.</v>

1134
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 4>So you think people give a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're less than they give a shit here.</v>

1135
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:36.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what you want more people who </v>

1136
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:36.830
<v Speaker 4>just don't give a shit about famous.</v>

1137
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.080
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or about seeing someone famous or.</v>

1138
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.410
<v Speaker 6>And it's weird because it's like I want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to reach as many people as I can.</v>

1139
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:43.940
<v Speaker 6>Like that's the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't like.</v>

1140
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like,</v>

1143
00:49:48.011 --> 00:49:53.011

<v Speaker 4>You're going to get that in New York </v>

1144
00:49:53.011 --> 00:49:53.011
<v Speaker 4>city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get that anywhere.</v>

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.770

<v Speaker 4>and the one thing that I definitely got </v>

1148
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.461
<v Speaker 4>when I first came here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to totally move back to New </v>

1149
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:05.010
<v Speaker 4>York after my first sitcom was canceled </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't like the vibe out here </v>

1150
00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.371
<v Speaker 4>at all and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was my first time ever working with </v>

1151
00:50:08.371 --> 00:50:11.100
<v Speaker 4>actors ever in my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did this really bad sitcom on fox </v>

1152
00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.600
<v Speaker 4>called hardball was written by these two</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys that were brilliant writers.</v>

1153
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 4>They work for the simpsons and married </v>
<v Speaker 4>with children,</v>

1154
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:20.790
<v Speaker 4>but then fox got ahold of their sitcoms </v>
<v Speaker 4>just to stuck cox in phase shot sockets.</v>

1155
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Fucked</v>

1156
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.750

<v Speaker 1>It just really,</v>

1157
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.390
<v Speaker 1>it was like when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1158
00:50:31.391 --> 00:50:36.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1162
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.930
<v Speaker 1>like a glazed donut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sodomized.</v>

1163
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I always tell everybody this is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can believe how bad it was.</v>

1164
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:49.490
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1165
00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the guys who originally wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were really funny,</v>

1166
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 1>really funny guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pilot was funny.</v>

1167
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It could have been funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been a decent show,</v>

1168
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 1>but when they gave it to some guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to work on,</v>

1169
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach and he was like,</v>

1170
00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those.</v>

1171
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:07.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know those fucking robot shows where </v>

1172
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like you could just plug it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your computer.</v>

1173
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 1>And it would be it real easy to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show.</v>

1175
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And one of the lines was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a desk with this girl and I </v>

1176
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about to have sex,</v>

1177
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.820
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coach opens up the door and uh,</v>

1178
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1179
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 1>do you mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1180
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.590
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mind,</v>

1181
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my daughter.</v>

1182
00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 1>You're attempting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my desk.</v>

1183
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You're attempting to defile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what he says.</v>

1184
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not defiling the desk,</v>

1185
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm defiling her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was actually a line.</v>

1186
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approved.</v>

1187
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1188
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving onto the next line.</v>

1189
00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually said that with the cameras </v>

1190
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:52.600
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:52.630
<v Speaker 1>that's how bad the show had gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1192
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 1>it was death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1193
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I was ready to pack up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up and got a lease because I </v>

1194
00:51:59.720 --> 00:51:59.720
<v Speaker 1>thought this was going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So I had a lease for a year and I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>had an apartment in New York,</v>

1196
00:52:02.271 --> 00:52:03.770
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I going to do now?</v>

1197
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And I just like leave this spot on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I wound up doing another sitcom</v>

1198
00:52:08.451 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was ready to go and it was my,</v>

1199
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.450
<v Speaker 1>my thing was just dealing with actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just dealing with the.</v>

1200
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Did they're delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really liked New York actors.</v>

1201
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Well all of them though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like my comps and everything else.</v>

1203
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.220
<v Speaker 3>Most actors I think are fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be like 30 percent of them </v>

1204
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.450
<v Speaker 3>that you just fucking can't communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've found that it was the same </v>

1205
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.000
<v Speaker 3>essentially in new yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a,</v>

1206
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's the,</v>

1207
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hitting the hive.</v>

1208
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 3>The way girls dress for auditions is </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1209
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Like I always look like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked like newly homeless.</v>

1210
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I walk in the room they like are looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at me like is she unit parked cars and </v>

1211
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 3>they're all like perfectly flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A dress cool.</v>

1212
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:54.380
<v Speaker 3>And I get to be like nonthreatening </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

1213
00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:59.381
<v Speaker 3>They all talked to in the waiting room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in New York it's like I look like </v>

1214
00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:03.671
<v Speaker 3>the other girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all talk to you and when everyone </v>

1215
00:53:03.671 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 3>asks me questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know where the bathroom is?</v>

1216
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I think they think I'm weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The level of like cap beauty up here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1218

00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:53.691
<v Speaker 1>I'll follow them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the idea is that in case you </v>

1237
00:53:53.691 --> 00:53:56.451
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait too long and then your boxes </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1240
00:53:56.451 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 1>this way you'll have to move up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs.</v>

1241
00:53:57.181 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1242
00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 1>there's no eggs left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all fall out,</v>

1243
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:02.400
<v Speaker 1>fall out of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still got to suck them out early and</v>

1244
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

1245
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 1>let me write this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys,</v>

1246
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.610
<v Speaker 1>did you know that you're productive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice from joe and brian?</v>

1247
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the girl ethical terms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like suck out those eggs.</v>

1248
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>do you know girls out here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually store their body fat also,</v>

1249
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:20.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be used later as physicians in their </v>

1250
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:20.410
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1252
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything with your lips ever.</v>

1253
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunate that someone trick </v>

1254
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.221
<v Speaker 1>girls into fucking with their lips the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way they did with their tents </v>

1255
00:54:34.221 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 1>because the tents worked because guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't care what a guy,</v>

1256
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:38.380
<v Speaker 1>what a girl has faked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though we know that there's like</v>

1257
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:43.850
<v Speaker 1>a bag of water under the skin that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making them pop out like that was so </v>

1258
00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any,</v>

1259
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 1>any movement and change the direction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shape better.</v>

1260
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a egyptian hieroglyph thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like for whatever it is,</v>

1261
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>it's the shape of the woman's body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you know it's horseshit,</v>

1262
00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 1>but that is out the door with the lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to the lips though,</v>

1263
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:01.510
<v Speaker 1>we don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1264
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't apply the same principles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tits as you can to lips.</v>

1265
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:09.951
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make the lips crazy and </v>

1266
00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 1>puffed up thinking I'm just going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it the way they go with tits.</v>

1267
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.760
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went,</v>

1268
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1269
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:12.480
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1270
00:55:12.481 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is lips.</v>

1271
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.060
<v Speaker 1>You can't do lips the way you do tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tits on crazy and outrageous.</v>

1272
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat what's up like that you're doing,</v>

1273
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but you get all fish face on dudes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get creeped out.</v>

1274
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the lips.</v>

1275
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:27.550
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw a chicken the gym the other day.</v>

1276
00:55:27.551 --> 00:55:29.080
<v Speaker 6>She was blow drying her hair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

1277
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 6>not elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she's getting up there and she </v>

1278
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:34.610
<v Speaker 6>clearly had implants and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had like the,</v>

1279
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ellis diversity of her skin wasn't </v>

1280
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.180
<v Speaker 6>holding up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the implants that kind of fallen,</v>

1281
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 6>so her nipples were up top and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just,</v>

1282
00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:46.330
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't stop looking.</v>

1283
00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 6>I was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she was just blow drying her hair </v>

1284
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 6>like naked.</v>

1285
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was her way of warning.</v>

1286
00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe girls would just like to take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>rugged lesbians and it's like a,</v>

1287
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.880
<v Speaker 1>like a fad and the only way to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1288
00:55:58.881 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to let those rocks hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the bathroom.</v>

1289
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.760
<v Speaker 1>YeAh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a girl just looks like she's had a </v>

1290
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:06.760

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's like a guy just fetishize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are in a weird shit.</v>

1292
00:56:09.021 --> 00:56:14.021
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some lesbians that are </v>

1293
00:56:14.021 --> 00:56:14.050
<v Speaker 1>only into running into girls that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had hard lives and so like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

1296
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And the next thing you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

1297
00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.020

<v Speaker 1>No arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1299
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 1>No arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible implants like rock implants.</v>

1300
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want anything fake on </v>

1301
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.670
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird thing that dogs not just</v>

1302
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:36.100
<v Speaker 1>became accepted but fucking shot up.</v>

1303
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:38.650
<v Speaker 1>But I've seen girls that have got them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

1304
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1305
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 1>they had babies and then their boobies </v>
<v Speaker 1>got all dehydrated.</v>

1306
00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became pancake boobies and then </v>

1307
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 1>they got their breast implants and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt better.</v>

1308
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1309
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1310
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does make it look better.</v>

1311
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

1312
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like it should make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1313
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 1>but it totally works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a trick.</v>

1314
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like the dumbest magic trick of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1315
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 1>What's on my shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't know what's under there.</v>

1316
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a bag of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1317
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.310
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ooh,</v>

1318
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I like big cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big real titties to a man.</v>

1319
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Just that's the shape of it that is on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mud flap,</v>

1320
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets our testicles to tingle.</v>

1321
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a symbol.</v>

1322
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so iconic and the man's mind.</v>

1323
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:31.220
<v Speaker 1>This is the man's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just your mind like from </v>

1324
00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:31.220
<v Speaker 1>talking to people like guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1325
00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.971
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I could know if it's an </v>

1326
00:57:35.971 --> 00:57:38.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like you've talked to </v>

1327
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:38.790
<v Speaker 1>other people about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1328
00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 1>do I think that's why fake tits work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1329
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.670
<v Speaker 1>That's why I mean that shape the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hourglass shape of a woman,</v>

1330
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why that is like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iconic shape.</v>

1331
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the hour glass shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for a man,</v>

1332
00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean women like guys with nice bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there there's no like shape that you</v>

1333
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:54.940
<v Speaker 1>could put up that represents a man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to a woman.</v>

1334
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I think every woman is really as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different taste in men,</v>

1335
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:03.271
<v Speaker 1>men's bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think for dudes it's pretty </v>

1336
00:58:03.271 --> 00:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>classic hourglass big tits shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'S on the back.</v>

1337
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 1>waifs though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are broken.</v>

1338
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:12.120
<v Speaker 1>They're broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have broken balls or one of them </v>

1339
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:12.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1340
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.690
<v Speaker 1>What if it was suicide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear that.</v>

1341

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you haven't seen him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1507
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1508
01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.030
<v Speaker 4>we got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:03.210
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human body is a strange fucking </v>

1510
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:03.210
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1511
01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:06.391
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you had moments with someone and </v>

1512
01:06:06.391 --> 01:06:06.391
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden you're in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them again.</v>

1513
01:06:06.391 --> 01:06:06.610
<v Speaker 4>And especiallY when no one's around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1514
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:07.610
<v Speaker 4>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1515
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1516
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.660
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1517
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:13.950
<v Speaker 4>just for whatever strange reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just run into them somewhere and all of </v>

1518
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:15.370
<v Speaker 4>a sudden you're standing face to face </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want to give him a hug.</v>

1519
01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.320
<v Speaker 4>And so then you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the other thing,</v>

1520
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 4>now what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We broke up for a reason,</v>

1521
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>but the chemicals in your body or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does my penis starts going?</v>

1522
01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.310
<v Speaker 3>We used to fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1523
01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>We could do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

1524
01:06:32.671 --> 01:06:33.690
<v Speaker 3>this was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1525
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:35.490
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1526
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you just keep,</v>

1527
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 4>keep doing that over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll never get out of relationships.</v>

1528
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.670
<v Speaker 4>So my thing is don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be at the same place.</v>

1529
01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 4>I've had buddies that will break up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same girl six,</v>

1530
01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:46.900
<v Speaker 4>seven times because they will always get</v>
<v Speaker 4>together and</v>

1531
01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 3>just fucking is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they just feels like home and </v>

1532
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:52.790
<v Speaker 3>you're happy to not be fucking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger.</v>

1533
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.590
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be fucking the stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of it it's,</v>

1534
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.580
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nOt even that.</v>

1535
01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:59.880
<v Speaker 4>It's this weird thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you break up and then you make up.</v>

1536
01:06:59.881 --> 01:07:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Like the makeup</v>

1537
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:01.740
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's reallY intense,</v>

1538
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.560
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to make up.</v>

1539
01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:08.310
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have insulted each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said crazy shit to each other,</v>

1540
01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:13.860
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then people get in like patterns </v>

1541
01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can recognIze those patterns </v>

1542
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:17.360
<v Speaker 4>when you start dating someone because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll try to pull that shit on you.</v>

1543
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:17.360
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll look,</v>

1544
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.720
<v Speaker 4>you insult you and they'll say something</v>
<v Speaker 4>creepy to you and you're like,</v>

1545
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:20.860
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>

1546
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Speaker 4>It came out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What came out of nowhere because that's </v>

1547
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Speaker 4>just how they rock it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like every relay,</v>

1548
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:28.060
<v Speaker 4>every relationship they get in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like starts off real good,</v>

1549
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:33.061
<v Speaker 4>get real close to each other and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>get fucking nasty with each other and </v>

1550
01:07:33.061 --> 01:07:33.061
<v Speaker 4>then</v>

1551
01:07:33.061 --> 01:07:36.890
<v Speaker 3>cover and then recover and I only had </v>
<v Speaker 3>one relationship where we got nasty to </v>

1552
01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:42.351
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since then it's been pretty smooth </v>

1553
01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:42.351
<v Speaker 3>sailing in and out.</v>

1554
01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:46.370
<v Speaker 4>That is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no darker feeling than someone </v>

1555
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:47.700
<v Speaker 4>who you used to like tell I love you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to make out with them and use the,</v>

1556
01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:52.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have sex with them and then all </v>

1557
01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:53.730
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden you like elena and each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other and angry words and they're saying</v>

1558
01:07:53.731 --> 01:07:56.180
<v Speaker 4>insulting shit to you take back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're lIke,</v>

1559
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.320
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only had one like that.</v>

1560
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's been since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1561
01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.730
<v Speaker 4>I refuse to participate in that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1562
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:07.850
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had a relationship like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>since I was in my twenties and when I </v>

1563
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.830
<v Speaker 4>went to the last one that did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1564
01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:11.510
<v Speaker 4>I clearly remember saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1565
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 4>this is never going to happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can never allow myself to get in this </v>

1566
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 4>of a situation where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I'm around this person,</v>

1567
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:23.291
<v Speaker 4>there's some sort of like an argument or</v>
<v Speaker 4>debate or jockeying for position,</v>

1568
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a weird jockeying of power.</v>

1569
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it goes on in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>combinations of relationships.</v>

1570
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you,</v>

1571
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1572
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 4>your confidence triggers the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of some guy,</v>

1573
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had that happen where </v>

1574
01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.851
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy is probably pretty cool with a </v>

1575
01:08:42.851 --> 01:08:42.851
<v Speaker 4>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he gets her up.</v>

1576
01:08:42.851 --> 01:08:46.740
<v Speaker 4>Think like you being a comic and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart and quick like those two.</v>

1577
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that must be like issues with some </v>

1578
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>dudes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who aren't comics.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'd love to thank like.</v>

1585
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll never date a comic fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1586
01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's nice to be with somebody </v>

1587
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:11.460
<v Speaker 3>who speaks your language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does help.</v>

1588
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.980
<v Speaker 3>But do you want to date someone as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up as you really don't think I've</v>

<v Speaker 2>it seems like you always have to follow </v>

<v Speaker 2>clubs.</v>

1593
01:09:24.811 --> 01:09:26.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like working at a place,</v>

<v Speaker 3>doing your,</v>

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Was it your first black guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've yet to go to the dark side.</v>

1607
01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.650
<v Speaker 3>my new year's resolution though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a black guy.</v>

1612
01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Like why hAven't I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1613
01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I asked my therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1614
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.610
<v Speaker 3>does that make me racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>

1615
01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.830
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think she was just trying to make</v>

1616
01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 2>you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this guy that joe wants you to </v>

<v Speaker 2>while you fucked,</v>

1619
01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.230

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 4>We're a chest protector and you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>

1621
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:27.990
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>

1622
01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.100
<v Speaker 3>that's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want like a brother,</v>

1623
01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:32.650
<v Speaker 3>like I want to feel his ankle bracelet </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're fucking.</v>

1624
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.200
<v Speaker 3>We need like a ton of lube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just for his elbows.</v>

1625
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Coconut lotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hobos dark girl.</v>

1626
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Chance you went down weirdo lane.</v>

1627
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I went down racist land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1628
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:47.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1629
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really did make that as my new year's </v>

1630
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 3>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

1631
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's going to happen.</v>

1632
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know people that are comics and only </v>

1633
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:57.250
<v Speaker 4>day complex and it never works out.</v>

1634
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.110
<v Speaker 3>it's just like not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like high school.</v>

1635
01:10:58.111 --> 01:10:59.970
<v Speaker 3>You're at the same shows every night.</v>

1636
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

1637
01:11:00.701 --> 01:11:03.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it's better in life and in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>

1638
01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:06.370
<v Speaker 4>to experience things from when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're close with someone,</v>

1639
01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:09.990
<v Speaker 4>whether they're friends or whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're coworkers,</v>

1640
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.530
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1641
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:12.820
<v Speaker 4>when you're really close with someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're experiencing life,</v>

1642
01:11:12.821 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 4>when you communicate with them</v>

1643
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>through a different perspective in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different perspective.</v>

1644
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you're dating someone that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a completely different set of </v>

1645
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.731
<v Speaker 1>interests in a completely different set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of desires and like someone who sees </v>

1646
01:11:25.731 --> 01:11:25.731
<v Speaker 1>life from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1647
01:11:25.731 --> 01:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>a totally different viewpoint than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>performer.</v>

1648
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

1649
01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it will broaden your </v>

1650
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll get,</v>

1651
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I think when you date people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of your line of show business or</v>

1652
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:43.030
<v Speaker 1>even any line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think if you're,</v>

1653
01:11:43.031 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're limited.</v>

1654
01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're like a ceo and you're only </v>

1655
01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>date ceo checks and you'd get together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have some ceo sex,</v>

1656
01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 1>what kind of line are you staying on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started to feel very incestuous,</v>

1657
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:03.200
<v Speaker 1>like just talking about like hear what </v>
<v Speaker 1>quinton's said tonight,</v>

1658
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:07.230

<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1661
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Like when does the work stop and the so </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1662

<v Speaker 1>of the greatest comedy cds of all time,</v>

<v Speaker 1>juvenile for several for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1687

<v Speaker 1>For some people it's like not good.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was a complete cd of non comedy and </v>

<v Speaker 5>funny moments.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There was a guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy named Mike Donovan who was</v>

1711
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 4>boston legend and when I was coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was one of the guys that I really </v>

1712
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 4>admired and he was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

1713
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 5>counting dice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing nixon while he was eating the </v>

1714
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 5>girl's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1715
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:49.610
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do mixing in that ass is nixon </v>

1716
01:14:51.951 --> 01:14:56.951
<v Speaker 5>impression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Mike Donovan was crying tears for </v>

1717
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.400
<v Speaker 5>fears in the back room of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection,</v>

1718
01:14:58.401 --> 01:15:00.530
<v Speaker 5>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tears recounting it,</v>

1719
01:15:00.531 --> 01:15:04.160
<v Speaker 5>talking about how great that cd is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially for a comic,</v>

1720
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.530
<v Speaker 5>for any up and coming comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

1721
01:15:06.531 --> 01:15:10.340
<v Speaker 5>you must get the day the laughter died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You must get that</v>

1722
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 6>start and you will want the crowd to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you and then you get a healthy like</v>

1723
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:20.080
<v Speaker 6>hatred of the crowd and then an </v>
<v Speaker 6>indifference creeps in,</v>

1724
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 6>but that's where I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just total indifference.</v>

1725
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like ugly guys and girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ugly guys and girls have this thing </v>

1726
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love the girl,</v>

1727
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.970
<v Speaker 4>but the girl doesn't love them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every time they see an ugly,</v>

1728
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.460
<v Speaker 4>a pretty girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have this feeling of pain inside of</v>

1729
01:15:34.461 --> 01:15:36.590
<v Speaker 4>them that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that connection with rejection.</v>

1730
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that the crowd is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just in the beginning we're all </v>

1731
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.581
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we grow to hate the crowd because so </v>

1732
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:45.581
<v Speaker 4>many times they punished us</v>

1733
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:47.500
<v Speaker 6>for the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the truth,</v>

1734
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:51.280
<v Speaker 6>and then we love them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not satisfying enough.</v>

1735
01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to get good enough to be better </v>

1736
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 4>than them to sort of guide them along.</v>

1737
01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>BuT.</v>

1738
01:15:56.881 --> 01:16:01.290
<v Speaker 5>And then they're listening to my comedy </v>
<v Speaker 5>journey.</v>

1739
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.100
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1740
01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:04.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I honestly believe that there's a lot of</v>

1741
01:16:04.921 --> 01:16:09.921
<v Speaker 4>comics that develop this sort of hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>for their audience and it's really </v>

1742
01:16:09.921 --> 01:16:13.161
<v Speaker 4>strange and I think the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes sense is they connect it with bad </v>

1743
01:16:13.161 --> 01:16:16.371
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They connect their audience with some </v>

1744
01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:19.650
<v Speaker 4>reflection of how they've put out their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own energy and their own personality and</v>

1745
01:16:19.651 --> 01:16:22.650
<v Speaker 4>how people responded to that and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own material,</v>

1746
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:23.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1747
01:16:23.251 --> 01:16:26.280
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they've had bad sad or if they've had</v>

1748
01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:26.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1749
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.940
<v Speaker 4>bad things happen in the crowd and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>associate that,</v>

1750
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:32.580
<v Speaker 4>that bad feeling with everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to see them.</v>

1751
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:35.370
<v Speaker 4>And so they developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met a lot of old guys that had been</v>

1752
01:16:35.371 --> 01:16:38.550
<v Speaker 4>in the business for a long time and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck with these people.</v>

1753
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.560
<v Speaker 4>One or I'm going to feed them what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like it or they don't like it and </v>

1754
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:43.560
<v Speaker 4>the show is over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right folks,</v>

1755
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.111
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they really do develop that sort of </v>

1756
01:16:48.111 --> 01:16:48.111
<v Speaker 4>defense mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1757
01:16:48.111 --> 01:16:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I try to be exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to,</v>

1758
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.350
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I buy now,</v>

1759
01:16:52.351 --> 01:16:54.180
<v Speaker 4>I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I do shows,</v>

1760
01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.100
<v Speaker 4>people come out that know me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's there,</v>

1761
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.440
<v Speaker 4>it's my crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>

1762
01:16:58.441 --> 01:16:59.370
<v Speaker 4>It's my crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1763
01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:00.810
<v Speaker 4>it's way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

1764
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:01.980
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1765
01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:02.370

1766
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.280
<v Speaker 6>I feel like very open when I go out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and like,</v>

1767
01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:07.470
<v Speaker 6>just like when I meet someone like in </v>
<v Speaker 6>life,</v>

1768
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 6>I give them the benefit of the doubt and</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1769
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:12.430
<v Speaker 6>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm into it but it.</v>

1770
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:17.470
<v Speaker 6>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I don't need anYthing from </v>

1771
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.470
<v Speaker 6>them right now where I am.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1774
01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel scared at all.</v>

1775
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Youth as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an intelligent person,</v>

1776
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 4>when you were involved in this sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre line of work,</v>

1777
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:33.730
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's self analysis that comes along </v>

1778
01:17:33.730 --> 01:17:36.701
<v Speaker 4>with creating new material and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times you start looking at this weird </v>

1779
01:17:36.701 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 4>relationship that you have to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange group of people.</v>

1780
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm seeking their approval and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing this and I'm changing who I </v>

1781
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1782
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a weird,</v>

1783
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.570
<v Speaker 4>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a weird thing that goes back and</v>

1784
01:17:44.571 --> 01:17:49.571
<v Speaker 4>forth when you're an intelligent person </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're analyzing anything where you </v>

1785
01:17:49.571 --> 01:17:51.590
<v Speaker 4>sort of insisting on the approval of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mass amounts of people,</v>

1786
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 4>which is what your comedy is totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>more so than like music.</v>

1787
01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>BuT like,</v>

1788
01:17:56.431 --> 01:17:59.820
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but before you were saying about being a</v>

1789
01:17:59.821 --> 01:18:03.420
<v Speaker 6>chick and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it might limit the subject matter.</v>

1790
01:18:03.421 --> 01:18:04.300
<v Speaker 6>You Can talk about that.</v>

1791
01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.230
<v Speaker 4>I did want to say limit what I said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes it more difficult.</v>

1792
01:18:07.231 --> 01:18:12.231
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm more impressed when a chick </v>
<v Speaker 4>can skirt the issues of sex or politics </v>

1793
01:18:12.231 --> 01:18:13.080
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or any,</v>

1794
01:18:13.081 --> 01:18:14.960
<v Speaker 4>any position of authority or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

1795
01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:16.830
<v Speaker 4>or someone who makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1796
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Because guys don't want to hear a girl </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes sense that they haven't figured </v>

1797
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1798
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:27.200
<v Speaker 6>That makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's what I feel like I've been </v>

1799
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.111
<v Speaker 6>doing like onstage about sex stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about the,</v>

1800
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.720
<v Speaker 6>like the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the female experience and not for the </v>

1801
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.751
<v Speaker 6>sake of shock and not for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm making anybody uncomfortable or you </v>

1802
01:18:39.061 --> 01:18:44.061
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to belittle or alienate the </v>

1803
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:44.061
<v Speaker 6>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like that.</v>

1804
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:44.061
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1805
01:18:44.061 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 6>and I think that I've found a way to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like make it acceptable for people to </v>

1806
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 6>digest.</v>

1807
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 4>I bet you have your smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>

1808
01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.530
<v Speaker 4>It's not impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is,</v>

1809
01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.620
<v Speaker 4>it's more difficult</v>

1810
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.550
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in that way,</v>

1811
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 6>what I'm my reason for saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1812
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:00.230
<v Speaker 6>so I'm paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience of the audience is having,</v>

1813
01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 6>like if they're not laughing and not </v>
<v Speaker 6>with me,</v>

1814
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:03.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1815
01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the path I'm on.</v>

1816
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm fed by that and I really react to </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1817
01:19:07.221 --> 01:19:09.560
<v Speaker 6>but I just don't feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1818
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.640
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1819
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:12.150
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where I used to.</v>

1820
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 6>If a joke didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would sorta just tap dance to the next</v>

1821
01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:16.040
<v Speaker 6>one and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe this will.</v>

1822
01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:17.270
<v Speaker 6>And that just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1823
01:19:17.271 --> 01:19:22.271
<v Speaker 6>that I think just from bombing so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so many times the fear leaves you </v>

1824
01:19:22.271 --> 01:19:24.360
<v Speaker 6>because he was lived out all your fears </v>
<v Speaker 6>on stage.</v>

1825
01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:28.860
<v Speaker 4>The moments of deep bombing</v>

1827
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.360
<v Speaker 6>right now people are like kate upton,</v>

1828
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but it's true the bump bombing moments </v>
<v Speaker 4>or clarity moments.</v>

1829
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 4>But I think that that's where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>develop the,</v>

1830
01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bad relationship with the audience.</v>

1831
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a guy with an ugly dude with </v>

1832
01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.671
<v Speaker 4>pretty girls just so used to getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>rejected that you folk these bitches </v>

1833
01:19:48.671 --> 01:19:48.671
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always lose,</v>

1834
01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 4>will go to a strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a natural thing for people.</v>

1836
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 6>I loved your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I learned from that.</v>

1850

<v Speaker 1>disconnect from reality,</v>

2012
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.230
<v Speaker 1>absolute utter disconnect from</v>

01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.940
<v Speaker 6>You can go after him and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>once you have your set down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super easy.</v>

2471
01:46:45.811 --> 01:46:48.540

<v Speaker 1>The only difficult thing about comedy is</v>

2472
01:46:48.570 --> 01:46:49.500
<v Speaker 1>writing new stuff</v>

<v Speaker 3>there was an area of New York,</v>

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 3>jimmy norton would know where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be able to share it.</v>

2500
01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he knows where it moved to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably does.</v>

2501
01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.660
<v Speaker 3>There's an area that was like near the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shipyards and shit.</v>

2502
01:48:09.661 --> 01:48:14.661

<v Speaker 3>drive through and there was hookers </v>

2503

<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like night of the booker.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like it was only shipyards and hookers </v>

2511
01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.410
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like I remember thinking it was really </v>

2653
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.910
<v Speaker 3>dark out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was kind of vilified just for having</v>

2654
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:45.501
<v Speaker 3>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she was doing something to </v>

2655
01:54:45.501 --> 01:54:45.540
<v Speaker 3>everybody just by having boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I was,</v>

2658
01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I just remember.</v>

2659
01:54:49.190 --> 01:54:54.190
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had really like super critical taste </v>

2660
01:54:54.190 --> 01:54:54.190
<v Speaker 4>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a what?</v>

2662
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:57.420

<v Speaker 4>I was very critical about myself at this</v>

2663
01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 4>point in my life and so I was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical about like everything I saw on </v>

2664
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.200
<v Speaker 4>tv and the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just a weird time for me.</v>

2665
01:55:04.201 --> 01:55:04.860
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2666
01:55:04.861 --> 01:55:06.270
<v Speaker 4>the movie fucking sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Nick did you know</v>

2668
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:12.930

2673
01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.920

2674
01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:25.980
<v Speaker 4>friends talked me into it and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody described to me sam kennison,</v>

2675
01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:31.230
<v Speaker 4>the first sam kinison bid that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard was done for me by a girl in 19 </v>

<v Speaker 3>but I do know the story.</v>

2679
01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:38.520
<v Speaker 3>I should've just pretended like I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2680
01:55:38.730 --> 01:55:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I probably told him on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you must have told him on the toilet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2687
01:55:48.711 --> 01:55:51.240
<v Speaker 1>So it was such a funny bit that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl wasn't even a comedian,</v>

2688
01:55:51.241 --> 01:55:53.280

<v Speaker 1>It was really ridiculous because she's </v>

2694
01:56:05.511 --> 01:56:06.940
<v Speaker 1>lying on her stomach in the parking lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>

2707
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 1>parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just so,</v>

2708
01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:44.540
<v Speaker 1>such a preposterous scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's talking about getting fucked in </v>

2709
01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:48.261
<v Speaker 1>the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a corpse is a for folks who don't </v>

2710
01:56:48.261 --> 01:56:50.781
<v Speaker 1>know what the bid is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennison had a joke about homosexual </v>

2711
01:56:50.781 --> 01:56:53.841
<v Speaker 1>necrophilia tax that we're paying for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple hours undisturbed with the </v>

2712
01:56:53.841 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 1>freshest male corpses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had been arrested for it.</v>

2713
01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:59.390
<v Speaker 1>So he had this whole bit about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on a slab like,</v>

2716
01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts rocking back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth like,</v>

2717
01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:05.790

<v Speaker 1>19 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked at the boston athletic club.</v>

<v Speaker 1>athlete whose knees had been destroyed </v>

2734
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:05.560

<v Speaker 3>for like three days.</v>

2784
01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:50.010

01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 3>and it came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain came back,</v>

01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 3>like I hadn't even gotten the shot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I haven't run since then.</v>

2787
01:59:55.451 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't hurt me.</v>

2788
01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.770

<v Speaker 3>it's a muscle in my hip.</v>

2790
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:02.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a muscle in your short muscle.</v>

2791
02:00:02.291 --> 02:00:07.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and got x rays and a bit scary </v>

2792
02:00:07.291 --> 02:00:10.201
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people who have had hip </v>

2793
02:00:10.201 --> 02:00:10.201
<v Speaker 3>replacements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking dark.</v>

2794
02:00:10.201 --> 02:00:11.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the x rays looked totally fine,</v>

2795
02:00:11.201 --> 02:00:13.260
<v Speaker 3>But he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to shadow cortisone?</v>

2796
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2797
02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:19.380
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so excited that my hips didn't </v>

2798
02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:19.380
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still doesn't.</v>

2799
02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It still doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

2800
02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:21.210
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hurt now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2801
02:00:21.211 --> 02:00:22.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was running again,</v>

2802
02:00:22.541 --> 02:00:22.870
<v Speaker 3>it did.</v>

2803
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:27.950
<v Speaker 1>What if you have to get an iron hip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be crazy because I'm not getting </v>

2804
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>a hip replacement or a hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what they do?</v>

2805
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>they saw off the end of your bone where </v>
<v Speaker 1>your socket is.</v>

2806
02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>They literally saw it off and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>screw this fucking spike that goes deep,</v>

2807
02:00:39.661 --> 02:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

2808
02:00:40.261 --> 02:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like a foot into the bone with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial.</v>

2809
02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about it.</v>

2810
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't measure it.</v>

2811
02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't get crazy on the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they screw this fucking long pipe </v>

2812
02:00:51.630 --> 02:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>into the bone and then it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial hip socket that's on the top </v>

2813
02:00:56.630 --> 02:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it doesn't line up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2814
02:00:56.911 --> 02:01:01.911
<v Speaker 1>Like one leg might be just slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the other leg because of it </v>

2815
02:01:01.911 --> 02:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>and when you're walking you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little fucking hits to your stroke that </v>

2816
02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.061
<v Speaker 1>you'll never get away with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll never walk normal for the </v>

2817
02:01:08.061 --> 02:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life unless you want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to open you up and resize it again.</v>

2818
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 3>But I'm going to get out of here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>officials bomber and</v>

2819
02:01:15.190 --> 02:01:16.610

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2820
02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial everything in the future.</v>

2821
02:01:19.641 --> 02:01:24.641
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a titanium bone for a woman </v>

2822
02:01:24.641 --> 02:01:27.131
<v Speaker 1>who had some sort of bone cancer and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost her jaw and they created her a </v>

2823
02:01:27.131 --> 02:01:30.851
<v Speaker 1>titanium jaw and apparently it functions</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the regular jaw that's better </v>

2824
02:01:30.851 --> 02:01:35.231
<v Speaker 1>than her old inserted in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slightly heavier than the old job </v>

2825
02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going on.</v>
