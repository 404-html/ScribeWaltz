00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Good googly Mowgli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everybody.</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan experience</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.891
<v Speaker 1>podcast is brought to you by tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ting is one of my favorite sponsors on </v>

4
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:17.601
<v Speaker 1>the podcast because I have heard nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>but positive responses from people that </v>

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:22.641
<v Speaker 1>have used ting and have saved money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a no bullshit and mobile service </v>

6
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>and what they mean by no bullshit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no contracts,</v>

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>no early termination fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no ridiculous bundling or ride along </v>

8
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they set up their rates.</v>

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>You use what you use and you pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you use.</v>

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>No overage charges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no penalties,</v>

11
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>no add on charges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no mysterious line items on your bill.</v>

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>They decided to put together a mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>service the way mobile really should </v>

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>have been done from the beginning with </v>
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense and good service.</v>

14
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:58.281
<v Speaker 1>They use this sprint backbone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have a major provider that's </v>

15
00:00:58.281 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>providing your bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing your,</v>

16
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>your cell phone service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can get the top end android </v>

17
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>

18
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>When you buy a device from Ting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to Tim's website,</v>

19
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>if you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot com,</v>

20
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>you can actually save $25 off one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these android devices,</v>

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>but if you see the range of devices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>they have all the cool new gadgets like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung galaxy s three,</v>

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung Galaxy s four actually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new one,</v>

24
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>the Samsung Galaxy note three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I have.</v>

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>The htc one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have all the really cool,</v>

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.710

27
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you get sprint service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same as sprint.</v>

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not some weird mom and pop company </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's giving you some rinky dink cell </v>

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.451

<v Speaker 1>money and do it in a way where you don't</v>

30
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>feel gross at the end of the month like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

31
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Got Me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking creeps to kindle team will</v>

32
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:02.571
<v Speaker 1>also give you credit for $25 of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>early termination fee up to $75 per </v>

33
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

34
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five percent rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that again.</v>

35
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Tim will give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

36
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>They call it their early termination fee</v>
<v Speaker 1>relief program,</v>

37
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will give you credit for 25 percent</v>

38
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>of your early termination fee up to $75 </v>
<v Speaker 1>per device.</v>

39
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you're getting fucked by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>other company when you leave and go to </v>

41
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:29.181
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>

42
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:32.721
<v Speaker 1>mobile service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool way that they've </v>

43
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>decided to provide mobile service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just no nonsense.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the shit that's on it.</v>

54
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:13.250
<v Speaker 1>That confuses me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the baffling stuff about what,</v>

55
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>what antioxidants are necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

56
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>what about digestive enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did they come into play?</v>

57
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.830
<v Speaker 1>All these things are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very crucial for health and very </v>

58
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>confusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to get to that today,</v>

59
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>but on it.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>carries,</v>

60
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>we essentially try to carry everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we find beneficial and everything </v>

61
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that arbor uses,</v>

62
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>everything that our friends use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

63
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu people,</v>

64
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>things that things that would benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>your physical conditioning,</v>

65
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>things that would benefit your cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>

66
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>things that benefit your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your endurance,</v>

67
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>what we sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's our strength and </v>

68
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>conditioning equipment like kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle ropes,</v>

69
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maces,</v>

70
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>those things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's the nutritional </v>

71
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>supplements like hemp force protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>powder or new mood or Alpha brain.</v>

72
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>We just try to sell you the very best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most high quality supplements that are </v>

73
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>available in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever we can find.</v>

74
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620
<v Speaker 1>If we find stuff that's beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try to sell it to you and because </v>

75
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>some of the stuff that we sell at onnit </v>
<v Speaker 1>is controversial.</v>

76
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>We're in the process of running many </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

77
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:25.951
<v Speaker 1>We just got back the results where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually just started publishing the </v>

78
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>results of the double blind placebo </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests that we did on Alpha brain.</v>

79
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the audit website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the results of that test.</v>

80
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It was a pilot program of 20 people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those 20 people,</v>

81
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>a few dropped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were left with I think 16 or 17 </v>

82
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.641
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we got positive results from two </v>

83
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from memory and from execution.</v>

84
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.220
<v Speaker 1>The execution of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually verbal execution </v>

85
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.220
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

86
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you can learn on a.com.</v>

87
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind it is what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're taking something like a </v>

88
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.541
<v Speaker 1>nootropic is you're giving your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>the building blocks to produce human </v>

89
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:05.670
<v Speaker 1>transmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nutritional aspects of,</v>

90
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thought.</v>

91
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And when you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just getting that stuff </v>

93
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.531
<v Speaker 1>through food man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to take a lot of weird food </v>

94
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:19.290
<v Speaker 1>and you could take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a lot of it in like </v>

95
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>really high doses while mosses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasses and weird shit that you're not </v>

96
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>going to want to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it is very controversial,</v>

97
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>so we're in the process of continuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more studies.</v>

98
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:31.351
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the Alpha brain clinical </v>

99
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>trial results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have them all posted and we're in the</v>

100
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:37.801
<v Speaker 1>process of a much larger test right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also in the process of tests on </v>

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>several of the other supplements because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're controversial even though we 100</v>

102
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>percent back them and support them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you try them,</v>

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.840

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 2>the Joe Rogan experience?</v>

117
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan podcast all day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

118
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.900
<v Speaker 3>What's an APA?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brandon?</v>

119
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.210
<v Speaker 3>We could read it all off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would sound like another </v>

120
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.210
<v Speaker 3>commercial on top of a commercial.</v>

121
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.710
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially you said a transmitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>or somebody can serotonin.</v>

122
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo Doo.</v>

124
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I should give it to you so you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>

125
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

126
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if trip to fans in there,</v>

127
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a really.</v>

128
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is just one.</v>

129
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>This has alpha brand that has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different shit in it.</v>

130
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It is the stuff that we take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>

131
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

133
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the actual ingredients.</v>

134
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Read that right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the actual ingredients.</v>

135
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda Patrick reached out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>because she had some things to say about</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that other podcast </v>

137
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>guests said about nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about health,</v>

138
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>and tell the folks what your credentials</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

139
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are,</v>

140
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>why you are uniquely qualified to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain nutrition and health to his </v>

141
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

142
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my name is Rhonda Patrick,</v>

143
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.750
<v Speaker 2>I have a phd in biomedical science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my undergraduate work in </v>

144
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 2>biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry,</v>

145
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm doing a postdoctoral </v>

146
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.210
<v Speaker 2>fellowship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

147
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

148
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:51.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started out with synthesizing peptides </v>

149
00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:54.850
<v Speaker 2>and doing organic chemistry and I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>really bored with that and I was a </v>

150
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate student research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and intern.</v>

151
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 2>So then I decided to try biology out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Sulk Institute for </v>

152
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Biological Sciences in La Jolla and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did some research on aging using worms </v>

153
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 2>as a model because they haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>short lifespan.</v>

154
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:13.661
<v Speaker 2>And so it was really cool to do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic manipulation and see how that </v>

155
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 2>changed our lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from there I was like,</v>

156
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I freaking love this.</v>

157
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to get my phd in biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I decided to go to Memphis,</v>

158
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:25.091
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do research on cancer.</v>

159
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>And a St Jude Children's Research </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hospital is located in Memphis,</v>

160
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:32.651
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up going to University of </v>

161
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee to get my phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did all my research at St Jude.</v>

162
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely fantastic place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

163
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was doing a lot of research using </v>

164
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.031
<v Speaker 2>mice and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some human cells and then I decided I </v>

165
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:46.961
<v Speaker 2>wanted a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just glossing over that I did </v>

166
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.241
<v Speaker 2>research with mice and human cells and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean I could go on and on about my </v>

167
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 2>actual research mice people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

168
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make,</v>

169
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>I've been most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

170
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of work on Mitochondria and </v>

171
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.071
<v Speaker 2>mitochondrial metabolism and how that </v>
<v Speaker 2>relates to cancer and how cells die and </v>

172
00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>how they don't die and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.610
<v Speaker 2>what's going wrong with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got a really awesome publication </v>

174
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.610
<v Speaker 2>out of it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

175
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I decided that I was really wanting</v>

176
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 2>to move on to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>during your phd you like dig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dig,</v>

178
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 2>dig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dig,</v>

179
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.830
<v Speaker 2>dig deep deep mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

180
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>And finally you got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just keep digging deeper.</v>

181
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:28.371
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like I was lost from like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what everything meant and what was the </v>

182
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 2>significance of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

183
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:33.771
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you kind of have to do that in Grad </v>

184
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:33.771
<v Speaker 2>school because you're learning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

185
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to use tools to answer questions,</v>

186
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:36.640
<v Speaker 2>what kind of questions and how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>answered them.</v>

187
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:37.630
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

188
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I did really a lot of that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

189
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.580
<v Speaker 2>then I decided I wanted to kind of take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a step back and look at the big picture </v>

190
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 2>do some clinical research and apply the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools that I learned in graduate school </v>

192
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 2>and try to learn some things using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.830
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

195
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>so now I'm at the Children's Hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oakland Research Institute.</v>

196
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:03.231
<v Speaker 2>We're working with Bruce Ames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a WHO's pretty famous for his aims test </v>

197
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 2>carcinogenicity test where he basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this test.</v>

198
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 2>I could help you figure out whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a chemical was a Mutagen,</v>

199
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 2>meaning it caused cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

200
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm working with him and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually looking at,</v>

201
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:19.641
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what causes the amount of looking at a </v>

202
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm actually a fundamentally looking</v>

203
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:26.571
<v Speaker 2>at people that are obese and how obesity</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerates the aging process of people </v>

204
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 2>that are obese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

205
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 2>have all sorts of age related diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>sooner.</v>

206
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Cardiovascular disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes,</v>

207
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>cancer by the age of 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like there's a 14 year,</v>

208
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.200
<v Speaker 2>a reduction in their lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think even greater than </v>

209
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.991
<v Speaker 2>smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to understand fundamental </v>

210
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:49.190
<v Speaker 2>fundamental mechanisms like why these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are accelerating their aging </v>

211
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm actually looking at something</v>

212
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 2>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at their DNA.</v>

213
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:58.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking blood cells so we draw blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>from people that have a bmi of 30 or </v>

215
00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 2>above or 25 and below which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered normal or lean,</v>

216
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 2>which is body mass index.</v>

217
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.930
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just problems with like using body </v>

218
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 2>mass index as a marker for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 2>obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

220
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

221
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.370
<v Speaker 2>some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 2>lean and anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

223
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of marquee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to go into that.</v>

224
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 2>So I'm actually looking at a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I take their,</v>

225
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>their blood cells and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at their DNA.</v>

226
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much damages in their DNA,</v>

227
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 2>and I kinda want to get into that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little later.</v>

228
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of explain what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's Kinda what I'm doing.</v>

229
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also doing some research on vitamin </v>

230
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.671
<v Speaker 2>D and I have a paper that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out in six days.</v>

231
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 2>It's going to hit the press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

232
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I found that vitamin D actually regulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin,</v>

233
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 2>so it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense for people in Seattle.</v>

234
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Don't get any vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get any sun.</v>

235
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 2>They're all bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't no thing.</v>

236
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Every winter people in northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>latitudes,</v>

237
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are,</v>

238
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having adequate levels of vitamin D.</v>

239
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really important finding to.</v>

240
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.950
<v Speaker 2>So that can actually affect your mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supplementing with vitamin D when you </v>

241
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:10.190
<v Speaker 2>live in a place where it doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>sun.</v>

242
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to talk about the details </v>

243
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 2>of this paper because there's like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>embargo and all that,</v>

244
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.531
<v Speaker 2>but I will talk about absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin affects mood behavior,</v>

245
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I was asking if Tryptofan </v>

246
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>was in your Alpha brain because trip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fan is a rare amino acid that occurs in </v>

247
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 2>protein and most people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

248
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 2>I eat Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting my trip to fan.</v>

249
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is is that trip to fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to get converted into Serotonin</v>

250
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 2>has to get transported into your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this transporter.</v>

251
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>It converts to five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

252
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It does convert to convert to that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have five htp and then it converts into </v>

253
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

254
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the principle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients and knew mood knew mood is a</v>

255
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.330
<v Speaker 2>five htp and defend the idea being that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of a slow release effect.</v>

256
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.480
<v Speaker 2>The ultra defend converts to five htp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then five htp convert to Serotonin.</v>

257
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Five htp can actually cross the blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain barrier so that can already get </v>

258
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.140
<v Speaker 2>converted into Serotonin in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and Tryptophan.</v>

259
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.150
<v Speaker 2>So tryptophan actually competes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other branch chain amino acids like </v>

260
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Leucine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leucine,</v>

261
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 2>to get transported into the brain and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>loses.</v>

262
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.350
<v Speaker 2>So losing these branched chain amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids they're at and protein.</v>

263
00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:23.351
<v Speaker 2>So what ends up happening if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking something like five htp or </v>

264
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:23.351
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that um,</v>

265
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:27.740
<v Speaker 2>most of the time you're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough tryptophan transport into your </v>

266
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:27.740
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

267
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Now certain things can help alleviate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that competition like exercise.</v>

268
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:35.071
<v Speaker 2>So exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take up a bunch of branch chain </v>

269
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:37.171
<v Speaker 2>amino acids to make muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So exercise actually boost Serotonin in </v>

270
00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 2>your brain by allowing Tryptofan to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>transporting to brain.</v>

271
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Alleviating some of that competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>from other branch chain amino acids.</v>

272
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually it's really interesting.</v>

273
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 2>They've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually deplete someone's brain</v>

274
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.480
<v Speaker 2>tryptofan by giving them a big bolus </v>
<v Speaker 2>shake of branch chain amino acids </v>

275
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.631
<v Speaker 2>because then it really out competes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trip to fan that you've from your </v>

276
00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:01.711
<v Speaker 2>diet and within like four or five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can deplete like 90 percent of </v>

277
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.960
<v Speaker 2>someone's brain serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they do all these like </v>

278
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 2>behavioral tests to see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the results are,</v>

280
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

281
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 2>how not having Serotonin in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>impacts behavior and cognitive function.</v>

282
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And they found that it really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that are sort of</v>

283
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 2>messed up if you're not making </v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin,</v>

284
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you become impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive behavior.</v>

285
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Your longterm thinking kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

287
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 2>some of your method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually,</v>

288
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:33.091
<v Speaker 2>there's a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a study where they compared </v>

289
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 2>methamphetamine users,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine users,</v>

290
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>and then they depleted just normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

291
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:41.161
<v Speaker 2>They depleted their trip fan by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>method I just told you about and </v>

292
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:44.641
<v Speaker 2>depleting the trip to fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically depleting the Serotonin in </v>

293
00:14:44.641 --> 00:14:47.611
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were your do your scoring just as </v>

294
00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:50.761
<v Speaker 2>bad as a meth user.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Actually Meth Amphetamine Does </v>

295
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Deplete Your Sarah Tone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that frightening?</v>

296
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's wild wild.</v>

297
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>

298
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 2>the fact that serotonin's affecting our </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and that it's basically,</v>

299
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:04.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tryptophan and vitamin D are important </v>

300
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't realize,</v>

301
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition effects,</v>

302
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 2>effects the way your brain works.</v>

303
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so confusing.</v>

304
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And when you're a regular person that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to go online or read books about </v>

305
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>health and nutrition and what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you don't need,</v>

306
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>there's so much contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

307
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that tell you you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need anything.</v>

308
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Just a balanced diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:26.560
<v Speaker 1>what's a balanced diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then that gets squirrely.</v>

310
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balanced diet includes grains.</v>

311
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

312
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 1>don't eat gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gluten's bad,</v>

313
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from eggs,</v>

314
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:35.020
<v Speaker 1>eggs contain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>it just gets so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much information.</v>

316
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to separate the wheat from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaff.</v>

317
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

318
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Wheat from the chaff.</v>

319
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much noise out there.</v>

320
00:15:46.481 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 2>And it's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

321
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

322
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get getting your nutrition from your</v>

323
00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:53.140
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that would be ideal.</v>

324
00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the National Institute of Medicine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're conducting these surveys every </v>

326
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.121
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call them the nutrition and </v>

327
00:16:03.121 --> 00:16:03.820
<v Speaker 2>examination health surveys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hanes is very notorious.</v>

328
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

329
00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:08.410
<v Speaker 2>in the nutrition field there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we consider n hanes surveys to be pretty</v>

330
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.920
<v Speaker 2>accurate in determining what people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting from their diet.</v>

331
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.410
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these surveys are telling us no,</v>

332
00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:16.900
<v Speaker 2>people are not getting what they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their diet.</v>

333
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.900
<v Speaker 2>The majority of Americans are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting what they need in terms of,</v>

334
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients.</v>

335
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to do so.</v>

336
00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And to do so on a daily basis requires </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to really eat clean and healthy.</v>

337
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Mean you can get what you need from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

338
00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:36.291
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really mind what you're </v>

339
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:36.291
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

340
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You have to really work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

341
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of effort.</v>

342
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

344
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 1>and there's also the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of you just surviving and not </v>

345
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.820
<v Speaker 1>getting a disease and you being at </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal health.</v>

346
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

347
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:52.670
<v Speaker 2>That's something that our lab works on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 2>but where we've got this sort of theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

349
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do aging studies in people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and particularly looking at different,</v>

350
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:05.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals and what effects </v>

351
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:05.951
<v Speaker 2>they have longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

352
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:10.090
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the theories in our lab </v>

353
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.220
<v Speaker 2>that we've shown some evidence of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

354
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.000
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of vitamins and minerals,</v>

356
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 2>there are cofactors for many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemical pathways in your body.</v>

357
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were just gonna go buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemical pathways,</v>

358
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 2>you'll see this massive image come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like holy crap,</v>

359
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:33.011
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vitamins and minerals are cofactors </v>

360
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:35.711
<v Speaker 2>for enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning they need to be there for the </v>

361
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:39.011
<v Speaker 2>enzyme to work optimally in enzymes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins in your body are doing </v>

362
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

363
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 2>that's what's right and what's doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything everybody's doing.</v>

364
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you don't have,</v>

365
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain proteins that are </v>

366
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.270
<v Speaker 2>important to survive right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your sodium potassium atpase know,</v>

367
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 2>you want to make sure your heart's </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the right signals you want.</v>

368
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that shuts down,</v>

369
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>then you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

370
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these,</v>

371
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.620
<v Speaker 2>some of these functions are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

372
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's the biochemical pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about these.</v>

373
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a snapshot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a snapshot.</v>

374
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

375
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 2>all these different pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they require vitamins and minerals,</v>

376
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 2>essential fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

377
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>

378
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And so cheeseburgers don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give that everything it needs.</v>

379
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

380
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

381
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

382
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>

383
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:32.090
<v Speaker 2>what is it that someone should </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely supplement with on a daily </v>

384
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.980
<v Speaker 2>basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

385
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I would say definitely most people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not getting enough vitamin D and that </v>

386
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a steroid hormone.</v>

387
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a hormone that controls the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of over a thousand different </v>

388
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.471
<v Speaker 2>genes in our body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is literally like 24th of our </v>

389
00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 2>human genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them in our brain.</v>

390
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what that means is without vitamin D,</v>

391
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 2>so vitamin D is so important that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it from the sun.</v>

392
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

393
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us aren't out in the sun a lot,</v>

394
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not,</v>

395
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm always at my computer inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

396
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 2>and when I'm out I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:19:09.051 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 2>we're worried about skin aging if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a female or skin cancer,</v>

398
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm bring sunscreen of course.</v>

399
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a majority of the people from the</v>

400
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 2>surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.050
<v Speaker 2>if you look at people that supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't supplement in the United </v>

402
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.320
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 70 percent don't get adequate </v>

403
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.301
<v Speaker 2>levels of vitamin D and actually the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we determine what's adequate is based on</v>

404
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:33.350
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D's classical function of bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeostasis,</v>

405
00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:38.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we know vitamin D is important to </v>

406
00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:38.351
<v Speaker 2>make sure that our bones don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't start breaking down,</v>

407
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>but in fact there's a thousand other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things it's doing and we don't know how </v>

408
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 2>much vitamin D we need to do those other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

409
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 2>but to at least maintain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's considered adequate.</v>

410
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's like 30 nanograms per </v>
<v Speaker 2>milliliter of the precursor vitamin D </v>

411
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.360
<v Speaker 2>called 25 Hydroxyvitamin d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what most people,</v>

412
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 2>when you get your levels measured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they measure.</v>

413
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 2>So what should you take on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 2>basis?</v>

414
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 2>definitely you should probably be taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vitamin D supplement.</v>

416
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And what dose do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>

417
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different things regulate </v>

418
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absorption and bioavailability.</v>

419
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one,</v>

420
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 2>it is a fat soluble vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more body fat you have,</v>

421
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:23.571
<v Speaker 2>the more it's stored in that fat and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>less of it can be released in the </v>

422
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:27.591
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream to be circulated and brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>to different organs in your body and </v>

423
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:28.720
<v Speaker 2>then get into the cells to do its thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

424
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:33.830
<v Speaker 2>so people that are obese actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>require much higher levels of vitamin D </v>

425
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>because it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 2>it's been shown that vitamin D </v>
<v Speaker 2>bioavailability is reduced by up to 50 </v>

427
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 2>percent and like severely obese people.</v>

428
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's one thing to consider is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much per body fat,</v>

429
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.370
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

430
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think generally a good marker is like </v>

431
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 2>a thousand I use per 25 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>

432
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>25 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be 25 pounds of muscle.</v>

433
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

434
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 2>I think the best way to really gauge how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much vitamin D you need is to just get a</v>

435
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go,</v>

436
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:01.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

437
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 2>if you have health insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health insurance pays for it.</v>

438
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other places that you can get </v>

439
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.500
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D levels tested cheaply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cheaply and it's just so worth it.</v>

440
00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:16.501
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get mine tested routinely because I </v>

441
00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:16.501
<v Speaker 2>just want to make sure that my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

442
00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 2>dosing is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I personally take 4,000</v>

443
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Ius a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a lot?</v>

444
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pretty,</v>

445
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 2>pretty standard for an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

446
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.800
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>normal weight and in pretty good shape.</v>

448
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

449
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:35.371
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pretty standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't say that everyone should go </v>

450
00:21:35.371 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 2>out and take 4,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use a day.</v>

451
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It can say that you should definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you have levels in your </v>

452
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 2>blood that's higher than 30 nanograms </v>
<v Speaker 2>per milliliter,</v>

453
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 2>which is above the adequate status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>

454
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 2>if we look at studies where they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at,</v>

455
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:50.350
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all car cause mortality,</v>

456
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 2>lowering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowering,</v>

457
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 2>all calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality,</v>

458
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.530
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

459
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge like large cohort studies.</v>

460
00:21:56.621 --> 00:22:01.621
<v Speaker 2>They've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've looked at the levels of vitamin </v>

461
00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:01.990
<v Speaker 2>D and then looked at mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying of different,</v>

462
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>

463
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with levels of vitamin D between </v>

464
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.641
<v Speaker 2>40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their blood had the least amount of all </v>

465
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:16.681
<v Speaker 2>cores caused mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically they were living the </v>

466
00:22:16.681 --> 00:22:16.681
<v Speaker 2>longest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

467
00:22:16.681 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:21.901
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want to have between 40 and 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>nanograms per milliliter or based on </v>

469
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:21.980
<v Speaker 2>that study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

471
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to get the levels tested.</v>

472
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.370
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda what I like to,</v>

473
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate because it's so cheap and easy </v>

474
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 2>use</v>

475
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.220
<v Speaker 4>and why not very few people ever get the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body tested for their vitamin levels.</v>

476
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

477
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 4>it is kind of unusual that we think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about health and nutrition,</v>

478
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 4>but how few people actually get their </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood tested.</v>

479
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.710
<v Speaker 4>It's the future really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're going to start to do that.</v>

480
00:22:48.711 --> 00:22:53.711
<v Speaker 4>It preventative medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to know if we have adequate </v>

481
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:56.311
<v Speaker 4>amounts of vitamin minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna get easier and easier the </v>

482
00:22:56.311 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 4>next couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you reached out to me because of</v>

483
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:02.671
<v Speaker 4>people on the podcast saying things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't think were accurate and you </v>

484
00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 4>got upset and sent me some videos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

485
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.970
<v Speaker 4>some different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the sort of describe what </v>

486
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 4>disinformation these people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>releasing more erroneous information,</v>

487
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

488
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.020
<v Speaker 4>give us some specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what thing will,</v>

489
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.100
<v Speaker 4>let's just talk about what bugged you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the erroneous facts were that </v>

490
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.110
<v Speaker 4>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most Americans,</v>

491
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 4>get all the micronutrients they need </v>
<v Speaker 4>from their diet.</v>

492
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 4>That was Brian Dunning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was Brian.</v>

493
00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Denny is not proportionately based on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

494
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 4>the National Institute of Medicine doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>these surveys.</v>

495
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 4>We know that's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in fact they've even done surveys </v>

496
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 4>where they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

497
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.580
<v Speaker 4>looked at people that supplement versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>people</v>

498
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 2>that don't supplement and people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement have much more adequate </v>

499
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 2>levels of these certain vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals.</v>

500
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

502
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 2>that's already the first thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not true.</v>

503
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

504
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:55.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

505
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.320
<v Speaker 2>this recent editorial that came out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the annals of internal medicine was </v>

506
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:07.931
<v Speaker 2>really upsetting because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically saying that multivitamins do </v>

507
00:24:07.931 --> 00:24:09.230
<v Speaker 2>nothing and not only do they nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do nothing,</v>

508
00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:11.390
<v Speaker 2>they're bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you mentioned that,</v>

509
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>you actually mentioned that on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast that you had with dunning.</v>

510
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

511
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that research that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

512
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:24.611
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of most irresponsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies or the most irresponsible press </v>

513
00:24:24.611 --> 00:24:28.931
<v Speaker 1>releases I've ever read because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually read what the studies were in </v>

514
00:24:28.931 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>comparison to what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying vitamins don't work,</v>

515
00:24:31.851 --> 00:24:36.851
<v Speaker 1>case closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the studies that they did were on </v>

516
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's patients not showing a any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of improvement.</v>

517
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.280
<v Speaker 1>People over 65 that had heart attacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>not showing any improvement.</v>

518
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean just those two things were two </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the three tasks that they did at.</v>

519
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:52.811
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that vitamins don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about a generic </v>

520
00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:55.530
<v Speaker 1>multivitamin to synthetic multivitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those centrum ones,</v>

521
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.670
<v Speaker 1>those ones that they find in the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Porta potties.</v>

522
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:00.020
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they clean out,</v>

523
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.290
<v Speaker 1>they find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find those little blue pills still </v>

524
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 1>like intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they pass through people's back.</v>

525
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly that might not be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never learned.</v>

526
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.080
<v Speaker 1>What do I know if I even looked online </v>
<v Speaker 1>to research.</v>

527
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just parroting it like little </v>
<v Speaker 1>minor bird,</v>

528
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but the studies themselves were were </v>
<v Speaker 1>really shocking.</v>

529
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you the the three things.</v>

530
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.740
<v Speaker 1>A male physicians over 65 showed no </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement in cognitive decline using a</v>

531
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.230
<v Speaker 1>generic multivitamins supplementation </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're dying.</v>

532
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I please just tell me that?</v>

533
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 2>So that study was so infuriating because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were giving these,</v>

534
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>these guys six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

535
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:43.091
<v Speaker 2>This was supposed to be a high dose </v>
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin and they were giving him </v>

536
00:25:43.091 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 2>six pills a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six pills a day.</v>

537
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a high dose multivitamin.</v>

538
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It's one pill a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

539
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their total vitamin D levels were,</v>

540
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.880
<v Speaker 2>were like 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use like 100 I use a vitamin D won't </v>

541
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.570
<v Speaker 2>do anything and that was considered a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high dose.</v>

542
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And their compliance meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

543
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you're asking someone to take six pills </v>
<v Speaker 2>a day for like 10 years.</v>

544
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call them up every three months.</v>

545
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 2>And did you take your six pills?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

546
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I took it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

547
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:10.180
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

548
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I took it for the last three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't measure any,</v>

549
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>there was no quantitative like </v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemical analysis,</v>

550
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 2>meaning they didn't measure any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

551
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 2>any vitamins like choose one vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in that your,</v>

552
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:27.221
<v Speaker 2>your multivitamin concoction and see if </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're giving them actually raises </v>

553
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:27.221
<v Speaker 2>the level of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 2>to show that they're a compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be that you're giving them a dose that's</v>

555
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:31.220
<v Speaker 2>actually doing something.</v>

556
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.450
<v Speaker 1>So you're leaving it up to the person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it as well.</v>

557
00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And especially when you're doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

558
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:36.360
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

559
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.810
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems pretty faulty.</v>

560
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And also you say that you take 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>units and they had 100.</v>

561
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other aspect of the study was that </v>

562
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 1>high dose multivitamins had no effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the progression of heart disease and </v>

563
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 1>heart attack survivors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

564
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.910
<v Speaker 1>they're dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>These are dying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not people who.</v>

566
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Preventative medicine is what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you talked about </v>

567
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:02.420
<v Speaker 1>earlier about testing blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

568
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that is the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about catching you when you're </v>

569
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.911
<v Speaker 1>falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about making sure you don't fall </v>

570
00:27:10.911 --> 00:27:13.701
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving your body the natural building </v>

571
00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 1>blocks to repair cells to keep your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy from the jump.</v>

572
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be doing in intelligently </v>

573
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 1>thinking ahead while you're healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're young.</v>

574
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.160
<v Speaker 2>It's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

575
00:27:25.161 --> 00:27:30.161
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 45 percent of the US population </v>

576
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.390
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have adequate levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnesium and you know,</v>

577
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people in the fitness </v>

578
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:39.400
<v Speaker 2>community are concerned with magnesium </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're always like,</v>

579
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sweat it out.</v>

580
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.490
<v Speaker 2>I got to replace my magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

581
00:27:42.491 --> 00:27:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that's their major concern or </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle cramping and things like that.</v>

582
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:51.071
<v Speaker 2>But magnesium is an essential cofactor </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a DNA repair enzymes.</v>

583
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.320
<v Speaker 2>So let me explain what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because poorly,</v>

584
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.150
<v Speaker 2>what's DNA repair enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

585
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

586
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.250
<v Speaker 2>everyday just normal metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our mitochondria are there,</v>

587
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:06.170
<v Speaker 2>they're taking food that we eat in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's carbohydrates or protein or</v>

588
00:28:06.171 --> 00:28:11.171
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're generating what's called </v>

589
00:28:11.171 --> 00:28:11.810
<v Speaker 2>electron reducing equivalents through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole krebs cycle.</v>

590
00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:16.811
<v Speaker 2>If you ever learned in biochemistry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those electron reducing equivalents are </v>

591
00:28:16.811 --> 00:28:19.370
<v Speaker 2>really important because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen which has an electron.</v>

592
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:23.330
<v Speaker 2>And a proton and these electrons get </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed along inside your Mitochondria,</v>

593
00:28:23.331 --> 00:28:28.331
<v Speaker 2>these various proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they shoot out protons at the same </v>

594
00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:32.351
<v Speaker 2>time and this is basically the way it </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally generates energy to then take </v>

595
00:28:32.351 --> 00:28:36.521
<v Speaker 2>the oxygen you breathe in and reduce it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to water and couple that to making ATP </v>

596
00:28:36.521 --> 00:28:40.610
<v Speaker 2>anyways so these electrons get passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and what happens is they often,</v>

597
00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:45.611
<v Speaker 2>because you're taking oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you breathe in and making water to </v>

598
00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>generate the energy you need to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>atp.</v>

599
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.940
<v Speaker 2>You start making super oxide and on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start making reactive oxygen species</v>

600
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:52.520
<v Speaker 2>in your Mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyday we're doing this,</v>

601
00:28:52.521 --> 00:28:57.521
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the major source of </v>

602
00:28:57.521 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Speaker 2>reactive oxygen species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've heard of that.</v>

603
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in these reactive oxygen species.</v>

604
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.210
<v Speaker 2>They react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

605
00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:04.880
<v Speaker 2>They react with your DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the react with liquids.</v>

606
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Your cell membranes erected the proteins</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the damage and what happens when </v>

607
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called DNA damage.</v>

608
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>When it reacts with Your Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.860
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you get like an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

610
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bulky Adec that's attached on or </v>

611
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you get like an oxide of </v>
<v Speaker 2>product which then can cause a break.</v>

612
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Your DNA is double stranded and cause a </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

613
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.230
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.640
<v Speaker 2>the cells in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in different organs like your kidneys </v>

615
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:33.640
<v Speaker 2>and your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these cells have a limited lifespan.</v>

616
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 2>And so they have to replicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to synthesize their DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate in order to replace their </v>

618
00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 2>limited lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

619
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the cell then tries to replicate </v>

620
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 2>its DNA and there's just like funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff there,</v>

621
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:46.960
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what is this?</v>

622
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes it puts another </v>
<v Speaker 2>nucleotide,</v>

623
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:52.900
<v Speaker 2>what's not supposed to be there and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes a mutation and then you have this</v>

624
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 2>mutation.</v>

625
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

626
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:55.660
<v Speaker 2>well you can't go back once you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutation,</v>

627
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:57.310
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

628
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a mutation in a coding region of</v>

629
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 2>a gene that does something important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could really screw stuff up.</v>

630
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

631
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.720
<v Speaker 2>in order to prevent that from happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have what's called DNA repair </v>

632
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:09.720
<v Speaker 2>enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

633
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.441
<v Speaker 2>and they basically take this damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's there and they repair it and </v>

634
00:30:13.441 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 2>those DNA repair enzymes require </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnesium without magnesium.</v>

635
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 2>They do not work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not work well.</v>

636
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 2>They're very inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not getting enough </v>

637
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.171
<v Speaker 2>magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your DNA repair isn't going well and </v>

638
00:30:28.171 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you're probably getting more damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that this is,</v>

639
00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:33.631
<v Speaker 2>this is a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes decades for this to rear its </v>

640
00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:33.631
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

641
00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:34.780
<v Speaker 2>you've got a bunch of you and we've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA damage,</v>

642
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but you can't look in the mirror and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

643
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have DNA damage today.</v>

644
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

645
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:40.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look in the mirror and be like,</v>

646
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 2>oh my gums are falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably have scurvy.</v>

647
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

648
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.410
<v Speaker 2>this is something you can't see and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is over a year,</v>

649
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.610
<v Speaker 2>over decades of getting this DNA damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it happens at random places in </v>

650
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:57.691
<v Speaker 2>your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually you get it into place that </v>

651
00:30:57.691 --> 00:31:00.181
<v Speaker 2>you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get it in a gene that's important </v>

652
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:02.761
<v Speaker 2>for controlling cell cycle or stopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad cells from dividing and </v>

653
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:07.771
<v Speaker 2>proliferating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are called tumor suppressor genes </v>

654
00:31:07.771 --> 00:31:10.680
<v Speaker 2>and when you get it in one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're screwed because now you got some </v>

655
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.161
<v Speaker 2>funky cell that doesn't pass those </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkpoints that usually our genes and </v>

656
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 2>making sure they don't pass the </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkpoint if they're funny,</v>

657
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.130
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll pass it and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>dividing and proliferating and now </v>

658
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 2>you've got this clonal population of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer cells,</v>

659
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes decades to happen.</v>

660
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you're walking around with not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:35.450
<v Speaker 2>not sub adequate levels of magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to know anything until </v>

662
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you're in your fifties or sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.960
<v Speaker 2>you come down with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

664
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when you read something like </v>

665
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

666
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins don't work,</v>

667
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:50.881
<v Speaker 2>case closed and you find out this is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research that they did and this is the </v>

668
00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that they came to from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

669
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.180
<v Speaker 2>That's so irresponsible and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>infuriating.</v>

670
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

671
00:31:56.501 --> 00:32:01.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of studies out there that </v>

672
00:32:01.501 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I've done Meta analyses and shown just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite.</v>

673
00:32:02.141 --> 00:32:07.141
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like this is the only research </v>

674
00:32:07.141 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>that's been done on vitamin and mineral </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplementation.</v>

675
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.750
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's really infuriating is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big overgeneralizations they did </v>

676
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.690
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

677
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:18.691
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there is an important case were </v>

678
00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:23.341
<v Speaker 2>taking some vitamins and minerals can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad and that is when you have cancer and</v>

679
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:29.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people had the opportunity to </v>

680
00:32:29.461 --> 00:32:29.461
<v Speaker 2>point that out instead of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

681
00:32:29.461 --> 00:32:31.840
<v Speaker 2>vitamins or bad meaning like everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't take vitamins.</v>

682
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.280
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should,</v>

684
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 2>they should be educating people on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

685
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Speaker 2>well you already have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This can happen to you.</v>

686
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:44.290
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the perfect example is full eight.</v>

687
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Full eight isn't essential b vitamin and</v>

688
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.040
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly fortified in a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>breads and even junk food like chips and</v>

689
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in chips and crackers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

690
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:58.710
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not that many people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States are deficient in anymore.</v>

691
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I think like 14 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

692
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge problem.</v>

693
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:07.511
<v Speaker 2>Like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However I'm full eight is it's essential</v>

694
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 2>to make one of your nucleotides in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA timing,</v>

695
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.770
<v Speaker 2>which means without full eight you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not making mean and you have to.</v>

696
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 2>You need full eight to basically make </v>
<v Speaker 2>new DNA for these new cells that you're </v>

697
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.000
<v Speaker 2>making in your body every day.</v>

698
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you don't have full eight,</v>

699
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.450
<v Speaker 2>that can actually cause a single strand </v>
<v Speaker 2>break in your DNA and it can do the </v>

700
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.141
<v Speaker 2>stuff I was telling you about by causing</v>
<v Speaker 2>mutations and leading to cancer </v>

701
00:33:32.141 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

702
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:35.330
<v Speaker 2>if you already have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's good for you,</v>

703
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like cancer drugs on crack,</v>

704
00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

705
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for you.</v>

706
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave me some of that.</v>

707
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:40.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

708
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just take over everything that's </v>

709
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 2>good and because well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 2>they want to keep that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their goal,</v>

711
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 2>propagate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to propagate and take over.</v>

712
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>So with fall late because cancer cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

713
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 2>they're dividing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to replicate themselves.</v>

714
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:02.170
<v Speaker 2>They love fully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it because that's what they </v>

715
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 2>need to make more DNA to make more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cancer cells.</v>

716
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So someone that already has cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be taking high levels of Foley</v>

717
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:12.610
<v Speaker 2>and really I think these people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote this editorial had an obligation </v>

718
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 2>to educate them and specifically point </v>
<v Speaker 2>this out.</v>

719
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a mechanism why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about it instead of making </v>

720
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 2>this huge overgeneralization saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins are bad.</v>

721
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:26.110
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the motivation behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>the study or the conclusion like that </v>

722
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 2>since it seems kind of unscientific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's confusing,</v>

723
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:34.511
<v Speaker 2>like I don't understand why they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be motivated to say that based on the </v>

724
00:34:34.511 --> 00:34:38.141
<v Speaker 2>findings of the got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless putting out that sort of </v>

725
00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:41.051
<v Speaker 2>salacious headline would get people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking or get people responding and </v>

726
00:34:41.051 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 2>cause attention to their work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

727
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's attention grabbing,</v>

728
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.120
<v Speaker 2>negative negative things like that get </v>
<v Speaker 2>press,</v>

729
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 2>they get attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their motive was.</v>

730
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I F I kind of feel like that's part of </v>

731
00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think another part of it is that a lot</v>

732
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:03.371
<v Speaker 2>of medical doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't trained in nutrition and </v>

733
00:35:03.371 --> 00:35:04.280
<v Speaker 2>they aren't trained in preventative </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

734
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 2>They aren't trained to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of all these vitamins and </v>

735
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.791
<v Speaker 2>minerals and essential fatty acids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how their cofactors for these proteins </v>

736
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 2>and what they're doing longterm versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>short term.</v>

737
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

738
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're trained,</v>

739
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:21.431
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually trained to understand </v>

740
00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:22.070
<v Speaker 2>how different pharmacological drugs act </v>
<v Speaker 2>on certain receptors.</v>

741
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:22.470
<v Speaker 2>How that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a different training.</v>

743
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think in some cases when you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about nutrition and preventative</v>

744
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people,</v>

745
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know about it and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of threatened and you feel like,</v>

746
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be wrong,</v>

747
00:35:35.391 --> 00:35:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 2>kind of like one of those responses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

749
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 2>and I think that may also have something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the fish.</v>

750
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the physicians that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're involved in the,</v>

751
00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

752
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.790
<v Speaker 1>this is need to be like a no nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>person Ho come on and all that.</v>

753
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bunch of Hooey,</v>

754
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need any of that so complicated.</v>

755
00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that a response to not wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>delve into the incredibly deep waters of</v>

756
00:36:03.801 --> 00:36:06.710
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and figure out what all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms are?</v>

757
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the sort of a knee jerk </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction to,</v>

758
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:11.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bunch of bs.</v>

759
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's two reasons.</v>

760
00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is absolutely,</v>

761
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:21.411
<v Speaker 2>it's a visceral response because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a load of crap out there and it's </v>

762
00:36:21.411 --> 00:36:24.861
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is hard to differentiate between </v>

763
00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 2>what's the noise in the signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some people are just like,</v>

764
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:26.340
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all crap,</v>

765
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's also people that </v>

766
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:31.360
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too much work.</v>

767
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:37.491
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep eating what I'm eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want to believe it's fine and </v>

769
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:37.491
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to believe it.</v>

770
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that's another really mindset </v>
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be changed.</v>

771
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see people eating more,</v>

773
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.730
<v Speaker 2>more Greens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more more of these dark green leafy </v>

775
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 2>vegetables which are rich and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different micronutrients like vitamin K,</v>

776
00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.210
<v Speaker 2>folic acid and magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

777
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about that in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think for people that are just,</v>

778
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.370
<v Speaker 2>that aren't going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.380
<v Speaker 2>at least give them a vitamin that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to give him some of these trace </v>

780
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.741
<v Speaker 2>elements and minerals and vitamin D and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these important micronutrients </v>

781
00:37:12.741 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 2>that they really do need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Magnesium.</v>

782
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at the very least it's just,</v>

783
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 2>it's an easy way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

784
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.790
<v Speaker 2>it's an easy way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that in order to really </v>

786
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 1>get a grasp on what is required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is necessary for your body,</v>

787
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it takes an incredible amount of study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

788
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.740
<v Speaker 1>there's so much information that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get,</v>

789
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.790
<v Speaker 1>not just as far as dietary information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but supplemental information is,</v>

790
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:49.250
<v Speaker 1>there's just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost feels you feel a little </v>

791
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.600
<v Speaker 1>hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like trying to absorb it all and figure </v>

792
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.211
<v Speaker 1>out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you actually need and what you </v>

793
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:56.211
<v Speaker 1>don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you read a study like that,</v>

794
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>vitamins don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case closed.</v>

795
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can not think.</v>

796
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Let me push that aside and just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an apple and feel like I'm doing my</v>

797
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

798
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I made a video to</v>

799
00:38:06.911 --> 00:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

800
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.990
<v Speaker 2>responds to this editorial was because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:15.991
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I could have done some </v>

802
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:15.991
<v Speaker 2>scientific paper and gone through peer </v>
<v Speaker 2>review and,</v>

803
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

804
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I want to get it to the people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like at some level,</v>

805
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this other scientists,</v>

806
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:24.220
<v Speaker 2>they don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the people to realize that,</v>

807
00:38:24.221 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because these people,</v>

808
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:30.181
<v Speaker 2>like my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad takes a multivitamin and he </v>

809
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:30.880
<v Speaker 2>listens to the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets his information from the TV like</v>

810
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.180
<v Speaker 2>that generation does and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

811
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:39.270
<v Speaker 2>it's so upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of a sudden my dad could stop </v>

812
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 2>taking his vitamin and I don't want them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop taking his vitamin because it's,</v>

813
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:45.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important that he does take his </v>

814
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.390
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

815
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.390
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain,</v>

816
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think components in that multivitamin </v>

817
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.160
<v Speaker 2>that I know he's not getting from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

818
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.480
<v Speaker 2>so at least let them get it from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin.</v>

819
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 2>So I this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this study,</v>

820
00:38:55.330 --> 00:39:00.330
<v Speaker 2>there was a Meta analysis that included </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30 different studies and I really </v>

821
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 2>read through them all and there were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of methodological errors and I point</v>

822
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:05.590
<v Speaker 2>them out in the video where people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

823
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 2>they weren't measuring levels of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals and saying they're</v>

824
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:14.630
<v Speaker 2>there were measuring some outcome like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular disease or cognitive </v>

825
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:18.190
<v Speaker 2>function without any biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was no biomarkers saying,</v>

826
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.360
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gave him this,</v>

827
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 2>this changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

828
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 2>that's important when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition research.</v>

829
00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a really important thing.</v>

830
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:26.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at some of the studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did do that,</v>

831
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were giving them vitamin D,</v>

832
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 2>they gave him vitamin D to a severely </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficient population,</v>

833
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.850
<v Speaker 2>which is like 12 nanograms per mil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's severely deficient.</v>

834
00:39:36.851 --> 00:39:41.851
<v Speaker 2>We're talking like rickets deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after their supplementation </v>

835
00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:41.851
<v Speaker 2>they were still deficient.</v>

836
00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 2>They were still less than 20 nanograms </v>
<v Speaker 2>per mil,</v>

837
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 2>which is considered deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

838
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:50.191
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're trying to look at this </v>

839
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:50.191
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet the vitamin D supplement,</v>

840
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:54.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dose that you gave these people was </v>

841
00:39:54.811 --> 00:39:54.811
<v Speaker 2>inadequate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

842
00:39:54.811 --> 00:39:54.811
<v Speaker 2>you didn't raise their levels to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

843
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was considered adequate by,</v>

844
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>by the National Institute of Medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when when people take vitamin D,</v>

845
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 2>which is the exact vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to take it,</v>

846
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to take like d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

847
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.450
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

848
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

849
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.420
<v Speaker 2>d three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take d two,</v>

850
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's just less efficient to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>converted into the active hormone.</v>

851
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 2>T three is optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>D three is optimal.</v>

852
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>T three is optimal and you know,</v>

853
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:24.031
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally can't tell people how much </v>

854
00:40:24.031 --> 00:40:24.460
<v Speaker 2>to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell them what I take,</v>

855
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:30.030
<v Speaker 2>which is $4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day and honestly I can tell them that </v>

856
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.291
<v Speaker 2>they should have levels of vitamin D in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their blood greater than 30 nanograms </v>

857
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:37.801
<v Speaker 2>per mill and we should also tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not familiar with taking </v>

858
00:40:37.801 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamins need to be taken with food.</v>

859
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can definitely get nauseous </v>

860
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.401
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're taking your vitamins on an </v>

861
00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:48.280
<v Speaker 2>empty stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus some vitamins like vitamin B 12.</v>

862
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>If you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a.</v>

863
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have an acidic environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your stomach,</v>

864
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

865
00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 2>you basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to have aesthetic of an </v>

866
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.820
<v Speaker 2>environment than you can't absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like there's,</v>

867
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:05.821
<v Speaker 2>there is factors that come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's complicated and also your </v>

868
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:09.400
<v Speaker 2>gut bacteria also play a role in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absorbing,</v>

869
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:14.610
<v Speaker 2>particularly in minerals and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you take vitamins on an </v>

870
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.631
<v Speaker 2>empty stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not attached to fats and </v>

871
00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:19.670
<v Speaker 2>proteins and carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they absorb as easily?</v>

872
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.670
<v Speaker 2>It seems that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

873
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been research done that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that your,</v>

874
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:29.511
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body doesn't really exactly know </v>

875
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:29.511
<v Speaker 2>what to do with vitamins and vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

876
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 2>If you take them on an empty stomach </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no food attached to them.</v>

877
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

878
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it depends on what,</v>

879
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 4>if it's a mineral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what vitamin.</v>

880
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exactly sure,</v>

881
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.570
<v Speaker 4>but some things you're supposed to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>on an empty stomach,</v>

882
00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.500
<v Speaker 4>like amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some amino acids.</v>

883
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.930
<v Speaker 4>You take it on an empty stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exactly sure about that.</v>

884
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

885
00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.420
<v Speaker 4>So complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even for Rhonda,</v>

886
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:56.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's so much to know about </v>

887
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.040
<v Speaker 4>what to take away to my friend Dr Mark </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon.</v>

888
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:03.041
<v Speaker 4>Every time I talked to him he fills my </v>
<v Speaker 4>head up with shit that I'm never going </v>

889
00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:05.511
<v Speaker 4>to remember the newest information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Glutathione and this and that and just,</v>

890
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to keep up with it.</v>

891
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.640
<v Speaker 4>It is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things do get complicated and,</v>

892
00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:13.540
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

893
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't have all the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do.</v>

894
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.680
<v Speaker 4>I do dig pretty deep and try to get some</v>
<v Speaker 4>information out there to people.</v>

895
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 4>That's why these folks who are inclined </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be of the no nonsense group,</v>

896
00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they find it so easy to dismiss this.</v>

897
00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:27.610
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

898
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.800
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he and I were talking and he goes,</v>

899
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had this smug look on his face,</v>

900
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 4>see that thing they said about vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't work.</v>

901
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you read it?</v>

902
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

903
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.490
<v Speaker 4>I glossed over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

904
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.520
<v Speaker 4>did you fucking read it man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

905
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say vitamins aren't working.</v>

906
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I go to some what they say and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed him what they actually said.</v>

907
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here.</v>

908
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 4>That was the test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

909
00:42:49.611 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the test.</v>

910
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.080
<v Speaker 4>Old people with heart attacks and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave him a pill.</v>

911
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't fucking die in a a longer.</v>

912
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 4>They didn't live any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

913
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:03.830
<v Speaker 4>And how do you even measure cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>decline in people over 65 with cognitive</v>

914
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 4>decline by a phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way isn't real.</v>

915
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.670
<v Speaker 4>Was by phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by a phone call.</v>

916
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 4>So they called them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you feeling?</v>

917
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No improvement,</v>

918
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 4>no improvement by a phone call that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was.</v>

919
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.310
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that really got me.</v>

920
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The specific.</v>

921
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 4>You were reacting to Brian dunning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who uh,</v>

922
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:30.330
<v Speaker 4>what specific things was he saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you got so fired up about that you had </v>

923
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 4>to contact me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

924
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:32.750
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one was that,</v>

925
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 4>that everyone gets there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there.</v>

926
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing was he was saying </v>

927
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 4>that was the vitamin C thing that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting to me too.</v>

928
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was going on about not needing a </v>

929
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.390
<v Speaker 4>thousand milligrams of vitamin C and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I looked up some of his stuff and </v>

930
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.511
<v Speaker 4>he was also talking about vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 4>napping important or not doing anything </v>

931
00:43:55.511 --> 00:43:59.081
<v Speaker 4>for immune function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he started talking about some </v>

932
00:43:59.081 --> 00:43:59.081
<v Speaker 4>Linus Pauling's.</v>

933
00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you what's wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy and it a bunch of things,</v>

934
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:06.260
<v Speaker 4>but one of the main reasons he does what</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does is that he grew up Mormon,</v>

935
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.680
<v Speaker 4>very strict Mormon background and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>refuted it and now he's an adult and </v>

936
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.601
<v Speaker 4>he's just not gonna take any nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grew up with all nonsense and now </v>

937
00:44:16.601 --> 00:44:21.341
<v Speaker 4>he's no nonsense and I have a unique </v>
<v Speaker 4>insight into this because I have some </v>

938
00:44:21.341 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 4>friends that grew up Mormon and now they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

939
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.260
<v Speaker 4>They abandoned it actually in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>forties and it's really interesting </v>

940
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.680
<v Speaker 4>because they're like children in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of ways.</v>

941
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 4>They really</v>

942
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.070
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the fundamentalists lifestyle </v>

943
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.830
<v Speaker 1>like growing up in a fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion where everything is spelled out</v>

944
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:42.831
<v Speaker 1>for you and everything is preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've accepted that your whole </v>

945
00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've accepted and you were told not to</v>

946
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 1>question and you're told to follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of this,</v>

947
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 1>this ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get away from that and you need</v>

948
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:54.120
<v Speaker 1>to try to like figure the world out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>

949
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking and developed in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fucked up way,</v>

950
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.640
<v Speaker 1>the way you make your connections to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like you have this black and </v>

951
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:10.371
<v Speaker 1>white sort of connection thing going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your head and that's his </v>

952
00:45:10.371 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism translated to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental skepticism.</v>

953
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 1>So his skepticism is fundamentalism now </v>
<v Speaker 1>he automatically is skeptical of </v>

954
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:26.511
<v Speaker 1>anything that might require additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking or curiosity or or something </v>

955
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:32.181
<v Speaker 1>that's going to counter what like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think like intuitively </v>

956
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:39.621
<v Speaker 1>think to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like anything that is a bizarre or </v>

957
00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:42.360
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that like doesn't seem like you</v>

958
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 1>think about someone and then the phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings and it's them nonsense nonsense.</v>

959
00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Immediately try to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

960
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want anything to be weird.</v>

961
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Can wipe it out from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific perspective,</v>

962
00:45:55.110 --> 00:46:00.110
<v Speaker 2>a sciences so often so often gray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so often not black and white.</v>

963
00:46:01.771 --> 00:46:04.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many gray areas and there's</v>

964
00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 2>so many trade offs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trade offs are really another thing.</v>

965
00:46:08.221 --> 00:46:08.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're,</v>

966
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.970
<v Speaker 2>you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

967
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you have this certain Diet and you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like going to give me best </v>

968
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.591
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to give me best cognitive </v>

969
00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:18.591
<v Speaker 2>function and make me live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

970
00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:22.581
<v Speaker 2>well there's some trade offs here for </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting all these things and I think </v>

971
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 2>actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really important.</v>

972
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not black and white and so people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have that type of thinking that </v>

973
00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 2>have been trained that way and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>

974
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

975
00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.270
<v Speaker 2>they've built up these connections </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

976
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

977
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:35.250
<v Speaker 2>it's black and white and if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>black it's definitely white.</v>

978
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that's just not how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it</v>

979
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.800
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their religion becomes just this </v>

980
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.220
<v Speaker 1>skepticism and instead of it being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>open minded objective analysis of what's</v>

981
00:46:43.221 --> 00:46:48.080
<v Speaker 1>at hand and instead until they just want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stuff it into this skepticism box,</v>

982
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and immediately debunk things.</v>

983
00:46:50.271 --> 00:46:54.320
<v Speaker 1>People love to debunk things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like a badge of honor.</v>

984
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.420
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like they get a checkmark </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in there,</v>

985
00:46:56.421 --> 00:46:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Carlo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

986
00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.220
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

987
00:46:58.221 --> 00:47:03.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're talking about science </v>

988
00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:03.221
<v Speaker 1>being gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course oftentimes it's not.</v>

989
00:47:03.221 --> 00:47:04.370
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often times it is,</v>

990
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:09.550
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of the science of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology is what's really important to </v>

991
00:47:10.191 --> 00:47:15.191
<v Speaker 1>kind of drive home human beings very so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

992
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.180
<v Speaker 1>If you get a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

993
00:47:17.181 --> 00:47:18.560
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phone that I have here,</v>

994
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I have a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works great,</v>

995
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but you could get a same manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same Samsung Galaxy note three.</v>

996
00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>You can get it from somebody else or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from from a provider.</v>

997
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the same components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built the same way.</v>

998
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>It weighs the same thing on a scale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sucks.</v>

999
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.060
<v Speaker 1>It fucking breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1000
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you a perfect example,</v>

1001
00:47:39.681 --> 00:47:41.420
<v Speaker 2>so I was talking about Foley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1002
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.500
<v Speaker 2>It's important to make timing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>timing it.</v>

1003
00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Nucleotide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also important to when you eat </v>

1004
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 2>protein and amino acid protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets converted into homocysteine and </v>

1005
00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need fall late because it's a methyl</v>

1006
00:47:54.921 --> 00:47:59.921
<v Speaker 2>donor that then gets methylated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconverted back in any because you </v>

1007
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:03.731
<v Speaker 2>don't want too much homocysteine around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're in your body because it does </v>

1008
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:03.731
<v Speaker 2>bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1009
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:08.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically makes protein started </v>

1010
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:08.760
<v Speaker 2>aggregating and it causes vascular </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and cognitive decline.</v>

1011
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.730
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent,</v>

1012
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually 10 percent,</v>

1013
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 2>40 percent of North Americans have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>polymorphism in a gene called the </v>

1014
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 2>methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also known as the mth empty t hfr or the</v>

1015
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:30.220
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker gene basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 40 percent of North Americans have </v>

1016
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.080
<v Speaker 2>this polymorphism in this gene that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make it work correctly.</v>

1017
00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:38.081
<v Speaker 2>And so what ends up happening is they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't read methalate this homocysteine </v>

1018
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:41.090
<v Speaker 2>to convert it back into mining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they end up having elevated levels of</v>

1019
00:48:41.091 --> 00:48:46.091
<v Speaker 2>homocysteine in your blood and unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>they take more folic acid to sort of </v>

1020
00:48:46.611 --> 00:48:51.611
<v Speaker 2>compensate from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have higher levels of </v>

1021
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:51.611
<v Speaker 2>homelessness in their blood and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1022
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:54.050
<v Speaker 2>which will lead to vascular problems and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive decline.</v>

1023
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.870
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the perfect thing.</v>

1024
00:48:56.871 --> 00:48:59.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like how much full at I take versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you take.</v>

1025
00:48:59.241 --> 00:49:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Or if I'm from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.580
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1027
00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you may have this polymorphism and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take,</v>

1028
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five times more fully than I do.</v>

1029
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the variables like how many</v>

1030
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 1>people grow up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1031
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you're in an environment that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology is not accustomed to.</v>

1032
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.470
<v Speaker 1>People who come from other countries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're in a specific country </v>

1033
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that's unique to their biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they're like what,</v>

1034
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 1>what the native Americans experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were introduced to alcohol,</v>

1035
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:35.100
<v Speaker 1>like this is not something that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology was accustomed to and they </v>

1036
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 1>really didn't have the ability to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1037
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Europeans who had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking alcohol for untold years,</v>

1038
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:46.530
<v Speaker 1>they were so accustomed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a normal part of their existence </v>

1039
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that their bodies have adapted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the native Americans just </v>

1040
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.461
<v Speaker 1>hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts to what it needs to </v>

1041
00:49:53.461 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 1>adapt to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts to its environment.</v>

1042
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:58.981
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts to its diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body adapts to the genes that have </v>

1043
00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 1>been passed down for your ancestor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor of epigenetics are attached.</v>

1044
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much.</v>

1045
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So for someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't need this and you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's like,</v>

1047
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much.</v>

1048
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>So there's so many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many components.</v>

1049
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 1>There's so it's so complicated.</v>

1050
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1051
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:22.490
<v Speaker 2>even your gut microbiome like adapts </v>
<v Speaker 2>like within 24 hours,</v>

1052
00:50:22.491 --> 00:50:24.110
<v Speaker 2>like if you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1053
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.260
<v Speaker 2>mostly a protein diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different like interior types that </v>

1054
00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.650
<v Speaker 2>are in your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:50:29.651 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 2>or are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

1056
00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that people that eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly meat and fat,</v>

1057
00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:39.110
<v Speaker 2>there are bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have bacteria that's like geared </v>

1058
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 2>towards breaking down amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking down lipids,</v>

1059
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 2>metabolizing glutamine because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>given it,</v>

1060
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:45.250
<v Speaker 2>a ton of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people that mostly,</v>

1061
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetable,</v>

1062
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 2>fiber and carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1063
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.570
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of bacteria that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in amino acid synthesis,</v>

1064
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.940
<v Speaker 2>synthesizing these things because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting as much.</v>

1065
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 2>But you can take that person that's had </v>
<v Speaker 2>this longterm diet and give them,</v>

1066
00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and within 24 hours to start to get</v>

1067
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:06.980
<v Speaker 2>that bacteria that starts to break down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the amino acids.</v>

1068
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:11.981
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is very plastic and it does </v>

1069
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 2>adapt to different dietary changes.</v>

1070
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you take probiotics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1071
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1072
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1073
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I do take probiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there.</v>

1074
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 2>The whole gut is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fascinating.</v>

1075
00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with someone that's doing a lot </v>

1076
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:30.180
<v Speaker 2>of research on the gut and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I get to learn just just from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and reading on my own,</v>

1078
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the complexities of it,</v>

1079
00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:40.451
<v Speaker 2>but it's fascinating like how important </v>
<v Speaker 2>important that bacteria is in our gut </v>

1080
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.510
<v Speaker 2>and how important certain types are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1081
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.810
<v Speaker 2>and how that affects the way we respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>to disease the way we age.</v>

1082
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

1083
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1084
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complicated.</v>

1085
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.360
<v Speaker 2>It is complicated in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1086
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:02.240
<v Speaker 2>the environment that's inside your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually can contribute to your mood.</v>

1087
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.600
<v Speaker 2>It can contribute to depression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute to all,</v>

1088
00:52:05.601 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of various aspects of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system.</v>

1089
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely info.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're.</v>

1090
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your,</v>

1091
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 2>if your gut is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
<v Speaker 2>if you have basically your innate immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems being active down there because </v>

1093
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.510
<v Speaker 2>it's unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1094
00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:25.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing inflammation and things like </v>

1095
00:52:25.511 --> 00:52:25.790
<v Speaker 2>having high c reactive protein has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated to depression.</v>

1096
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a biomarker that you </v>

1097
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:35.111
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think can be used with depression is </v>

1098
00:52:35.111 --> 00:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>actually c reactive protein instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just this vague kind of,</v>

1099
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:37.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel this,</v>

1100
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:42.911
<v Speaker 2>I feel that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's measure your c reactive protein </v>

1101
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:42.911
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1102
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:42.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1103
00:52:42.911 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 2>They're really high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1104
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.710
<v Speaker 2>they've even done some studies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

1105
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:49.830
<v Speaker 2>they've found they've gotten depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patients found that they had highest </v>

1106
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 2>direct protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him like two grams of EPA.</v>

1107
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>EPA is the omega three fatty acid that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>important for.</v>

1108
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like anti-inflammatory as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Dha,</v>

1109
00:52:58.581 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 2>which is most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 2>most of your brain lipitor a Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two grams of EPA day,</v>

1111
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I forgot for how long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they lowered their c reactive </v>

1112
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:09.710
<v Speaker 2>protein and helped with her depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1113
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.580
<v Speaker 2>so that's pretty profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very profound.</v>

1114
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:18.610
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connection between the human body </v>

1115
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>and depression is such a weird one </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for so many folks,</v>

1116
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 2>the go to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel good.</v>

1117
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:25.380
<v Speaker 2>The doctor gives them an antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel better.</v>

1118
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>And then that's</v>

1119
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.560
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

1120
00:53:27.561 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 1>there could have been so many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that could have been manipulated</v>

1121
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 1>either their diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their exercise routines,</v>

1122
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 1>hydrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1123
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.590
<v Speaker 1>how many people are fucking just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dehydrated.</v>

1124
00:53:38.591 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 1>They'd feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1125
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 1>how many people get out of a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

1126
00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1127
00:53:42.421 --> 00:53:44.490
<v Speaker 1>how many people have a bad job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1128
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.820
<v Speaker 1>consider what people considered to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1129
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:50.230
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1130
00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1131
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you're moody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're down the dumps,</v>

1132
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1133
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not feeling good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1134
00:53:55.821 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you have bad thoughts all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then consider what's the stimulation</v>

1135
00:54:00.391 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is receiving everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you driving and traffic in fucking</v>

1136
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:09.051
<v Speaker 1>pollution to a cubicle where you sit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do shit that you don't want to do all </v>

1137
00:54:09.051 --> 00:54:13.460
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get home and then you force feed </v>

1138
00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:13.460
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 1>some terrible foods because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and you're,</v>

1140
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of indulging,</v>

1141
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.980
<v Speaker 1>giving yourself some pleasure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shitty macaroni and cheese or </v>

1142
00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:25.791
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stuffing down your face and then </v>

1143
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:25.791
<v Speaker 1>you wonder why you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1144
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:25.791
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1145
00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This reminds me of a study where,</v>

1146
00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:27.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1147
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:32.470
<v Speaker 2>they're using telomere length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So telomeres are like caps at the end of</v>

1148
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 2>your chromosomes that prevent your DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>from degrading and from getting damaged.</v>

1149
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often refer to like the tips of </v>

1150
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:43.180
<v Speaker 2>shoelaces like telomeres because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent your shoelaces from fraying.</v>

1151
00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And these telomere length,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>

1152
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:47.410
<v Speaker 2>they're there when you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're long,</v>

1153
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.860
<v Speaker 2>but each time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each time your cell divides,</v>

1154
00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 2>they get shorter and shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with each year they're getting </v>

1155
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.320
<v Speaker 2>shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you lose like 22 nucleotides a </v>

1156
00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.350
<v Speaker 2>year off your telomeres and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological marker for aging.</v>

1157
00:54:59.351 --> 00:55:02.200
<v Speaker 2>So the shorter your telomeres are a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 2>the shorter your life is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at lingers for a young </v>

1159
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.661
<v Speaker 2>person versus an old person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see dramatic differences and </v>

1160
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stress has been correlated with taking </v>

1161
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:13.930
<v Speaker 2>like five years off your team length.</v>

1162
00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite has been true.</v>

1163
00:55:15.581 --> 00:55:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that meditation,</v>

1164
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:20.380
<v Speaker 2>there's actually an enzyme that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuild your telomeres,</v>

1165
00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.480
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't express it in high levels,</v>

1166
00:55:22.481 --> 00:55:27.481
<v Speaker 2>it's called telomerase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Meditation can actually boost the </v>

1167
00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:31.570
<v Speaker 2>expression of telomerase and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cause your telomeres to get longer.</v>

1168
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's really something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1169
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.820
<v Speaker 2>having a more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to meditate,</v>

1170
00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:38.900
<v Speaker 2>not having a lot of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1171
00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting the way you age literally.</v>

1172
00:55:41.711 --> 00:55:44.380
<v Speaker 2>And we have a biological marker for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1173
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:45.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

1174
00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D I wanted to,</v>

1175
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:50.080
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D affects the telomere length </v>
<v Speaker 2>also.</v>

1176
00:55:50.081 --> 00:55:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1177
00:55:51.461 --> 00:55:56.461
<v Speaker 2>if you google vitamin D receptor mice </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pull up this image with the mice.</v>

1178
00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:02.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm aging mice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so vitamin D actually does affect the </v>

1179
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:02.560
<v Speaker 2>way we age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1180
00:56:02.561 --> 00:56:06.550
<v Speaker 2>and they did this study on twins where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at their vitamin D levels,</v>

1181
00:56:06.551 --> 00:56:09.790
<v Speaker 2>they measured their vitamin D levels and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at their telomere length and</v>

1182
00:56:09.791 --> 00:56:14.110
<v Speaker 2>they found that those twins with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest levels of vitamin D also had the</v>

1183
00:56:14.111 --> 00:56:19.111
<v Speaker 2>longest telomeres that corresponded to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually five years being five years </v>

1184
00:56:19.111 --> 00:56:20.290
<v Speaker 2>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they were twins.</v>

1185
00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 2>They're same chronological age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their team members looked,</v>

1186
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 2>they were five years younger if they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher levels of Vitamin D.</v>

1187
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 2>So what do you know anything about t a </v>
<v Speaker 2>65.</v>

1189
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I saw sort of a supplement that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to enhance your telomere </v>

1190
00:56:37.871 --> 00:56:40.750
<v Speaker 2>lengths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard of it.</v>

1191
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm now so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but vitamin D exercise is another one </v>

1192
00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:47.940
<v Speaker 2>that does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done studies showing a,</v>

1193
00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.530
<v Speaker 2>again in twins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1194
00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:54.540
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exercise the most actually had two </v>

1195
00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.720
<v Speaker 2>of them are length that corresponded to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being 10 years younger.</v>

1196
00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exercise sort of like average </v>

1197
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 2>compared to those that didn't have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average of like,</v>

1198
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I think four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1199
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1200
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:08.550
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things that affect the way you </v>

1201
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:08.550
<v Speaker 2>age and we have markers for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological markers like Taylor,</v>

1202
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 2>my length that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that proves your lifestyle is indeed,</v>

1203
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting the way you age you.</v>

1204
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I'd read this telomere study and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen this with this supplement.</v>

1205
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1206
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:24.770
<v Speaker 2>So let's check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those two minds on that decay,</v>

1207
00:57:24.771 --> 00:57:27.630
<v Speaker 2>these are the same age mouse said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top panel,</v>

1208
00:57:27.631 --> 00:57:32.631
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mice are about four and a half </v>

1209
00:57:32.631 --> 00:57:34.050
<v Speaker 2>months old and the one on the left is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D receptor knockout,</v>

1210
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>knockout mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it can't respond to vitamin </v>

1211
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:39.300
<v Speaker 2>D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1212
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like not having any vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the lower panel,</v>

1213
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:42.520
<v Speaker 2>those are the same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months later.</v>

1214
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Look how rapidly that mouse aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having vitamin D.</v>

1215
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things going wrong.</v>

1216
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:54.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you that vitamin D's regulating </v>

1217
00:57:54.511 --> 00:57:54.511
<v Speaker 2>over a thousand different genes in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1218
00:57:54.511 --> 00:57:56.260
<v Speaker 2>So inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cognitive function.</v>

1219
00:57:56.261 --> 00:57:57.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things,</v>

1220
00:57:57.581 --> 00:57:59.620
<v Speaker 2>but look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty striking.</v>

1221
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about going into </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1222
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.880
<v Speaker 2>like where you provide some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>service where people get tested and then</v>

1223
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.570
<v Speaker 2>they develop a specific vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>protocols for each individual person?</v>

1224
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1225
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.920
<v Speaker 2>We're like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1226
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.550
<v Speaker 2>my boss and I were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about that all the time.</v>

1227
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like I've got this asset where</v>

1228
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:27.511
<v Speaker 2>I can actually measure DNA damage in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body from your blood and that's </v>

1229
00:58:27.511 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 2>also a marker for age because the older </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

1230
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 2>the more DNA damage you have and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure that clinically.</v>

1231
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 2>So what we're thinking is like giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>people magnesium and seeing if we can,</v>

1232
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:42.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than that damage because there are </v>

1233
00:58:42.391 --> 00:58:42.670
<v Speaker 2>DNA repairs working better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1234
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 2>but that would be really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing would be vitamin D,</v>

1235
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring during the vitamin D,</v>

1236
00:58:48.401 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 2>magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:58:48.911 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a few,</v>

1238
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:57.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients that we know of that are </v>

1239
00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:57.220
<v Speaker 2>really important for longterm effects.</v>

1240
00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1241
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 2>like I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's often this tradeoff where,</v>

1242
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you,</v>

1243
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting some vitamin K but you </v>

1244
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 2>don't have enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1245
00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 2>35 percent of the US population doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get enough.</v>

1246
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin K,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin K is found in plants because </v>

1247
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need it for photosynthesis.</v>

1248
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not eating a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of green plants,</v>

1249
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1250
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you might not be getting enough vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>K.</v>

1251
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1252
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:25.060
<v Speaker 2>vitamin K is often known for being part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of coagulation,</v>

1253
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 2>being important to make your blood clot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1254
00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:30.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's an essential function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure any vitamin K you're getting</v>

1255
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 2>is going towards that because you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood to clot,</v>

1256
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:38.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to bleed out and have a </v>

1257
00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:38.171
<v Speaker 2>hemorrhage rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's other important functions of</v>

1258
00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:42.431
<v Speaker 2>vitamin K.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin K also prevents the </v>

1259
00:59:42.431 --> 00:59:42.431
<v Speaker 2>calcification of the arteries.</v>

1260
00:59:42.431 --> 00:59:46.330
<v Speaker 2>And so if all your vitamin K is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards the proteins that are important </v>

1261
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:50.741
<v Speaker 2>for clotting than the proteins that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for not having calcification </v>

1262
00:59:50.741 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 2>in your arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't getting any,</v>

1263
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1264
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three decades later and you start to see</v>

1265
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 2>this calcification in the arteries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact people that are given Warfarin,</v>

1266
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>which is a really common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drug for inhibiting vitaminK ,</v>

1267
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:08.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up having problems with </v>

1268
01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 2>calcification of arteries and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1269
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1270
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot to understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>how these micronutrients work that we </v>

1271
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:22.571
<v Speaker 2>don't know yet and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to try to be able to do </v>

1272
01:00:22.571 --> 01:00:23.760
<v Speaker 2>some experiments to understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1273
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 2>your body's smart and if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough of a certain vitamin or mineral,</v>

1275
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to shunt it to the one that's</v>

1276
01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:35.590
<v Speaker 2>going to help you survive now and help </v>
<v Speaker 2>you reproduce because that's the,</v>

1277
01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>that's what he wants to do.</v>

1278
01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>And these other things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:43.010
<v Speaker 2>in Dna repairing damaged DNA or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1280
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:48.011
<v Speaker 2>having to brain work optimally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be that smart to </v>

1281
01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:48.011
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably get the short end,</v>

1283
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of like,</v>

1284
01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:56.021
<v Speaker 2>it's a vitamins in my mind is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a long longterm thinking when </v>

1285
01:00:56.021 --> 01:00:56.070
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking long term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1286
01:00:56.071 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1287
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:59.660
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not walking around with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acute deficiencies,</v>

1288
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:01.550
<v Speaker 2>which is what most people think when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking,</v>

1289
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough vitamins and minerals </v>

1290
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have very buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

1291
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1292
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 2>these problems that are severe </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies.</v>

1293
01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:10.760
<v Speaker 2>That's like if you're severely </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficient,</v>

1294
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have some symptoms that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll notice,</v>

1295
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:15.710
<v Speaker 2>but most of these symptoms you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to notice and they,</v>

1296
01:01:15.711 --> 01:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>they're insidious damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening,</v>

1297
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit at a time over decades.</v>

1298
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to me that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of these like a center</v>

1299
01:01:27.301 --> 01:01:32.301
<v Speaker 1>where you could go and get a full workup</v>
<v Speaker 1>done and they provide you with like a </v>

1300
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>recipe for your vitamin supplementation </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs</v>

1301
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.620
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what we want.</v>

1302
01:01:37.621 --> 01:01:42.621
<v Speaker 2>Like we want to get it to where we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just get a finger prick of blood and </v>

1303
01:01:42.621 --> 01:01:45.240
<v Speaker 2>will know different proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can measure that are we know,</v>

1304
01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:50.241
<v Speaker 2>are involved in longterm functions </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus a short term functions of these </v>

1305
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and we can say based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.510
<v Speaker 2>having looking at these proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say okay,</v>

1307
01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:59.511
<v Speaker 2>you need more of this and this and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin like that's going to be the </v>

1308
01:01:59.511 --> 01:01:59.511
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1309
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>It would seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean you'd go to the dentist,</v>

1310
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the dentist is a normal common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere to repair your teeth </v>

1311
01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's such a basic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1312
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of going to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures your blood and finds out what </v>

1313
01:02:13.181 --> 01:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you're lacking in your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not</v>

1314
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.740
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think instead of going to a doctor to </v>

1315
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 2>try to find a quick fix to get some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they gave you an Ssri.</v>

1317
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what these,</v>

1318
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>what the longterm effects of some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these pharmaceutical drugs are in our </v>

1319
01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.021
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just had this study that came </v>

1320
01:02:33.021 --> 01:02:33.021
<v Speaker 2>out a couple months ago on anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotics,</v>

1321
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:38.030
<v Speaker 2>which they give routinely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave people with schizophrenia and they </v>

1322
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:41.811
<v Speaker 2>found that these anti psychotics in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dose dependent manner cause brain </v>

1323
01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1324
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 2>And they followed these people for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1325
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:49.550
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first longterm effect of </v>

1326
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.881
<v Speaker 2>Anti psychotics that came out that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a really big study and they showed </v>

1327
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:58.371
<v Speaker 2>that these skits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia patients like the higher </v>

1328
01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:01.191
<v Speaker 2>the dose of Anti Psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on the more brain atrophy and </v>

1329
01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:01.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1330
01:03:01.191 --> 01:03:05.180
<v Speaker 2>so here you are giving these people anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotics and you know,</v>

1331
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:10.580
<v Speaker 2>15 years from now their brain is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally it's an atrophying at a rapid </v>

1332
01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:10.580
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>

1333
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's just a classic example of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what some of these long term</v>

1334
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 2>effects of some of these pharma logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that we're doing.</v>

1335
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it comes to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many feedback loops.</v>

1336
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:25.401
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're inhibiting serotonin from </v>

1337
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.651
<v Speaker 2>being metabolized or re uptake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've got serotonin sitting </v>

1338
01:03:27.651 --> 01:03:30.801
<v Speaker 2>around your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to downregulate serotonin </v>

1339
01:03:30.801 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 2>receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how your body responds to Sarah</v>

1340
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1341
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:36.561
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's feedback things going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on that I don't think we even </v>

1342
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:36.750
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1343
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 2>one out of 10 Americans is taking an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ssri so crazy.</v>

1344
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1345
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And I know that they have benefited some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1346
01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I know people that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

1347
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's have they exhausted all the other </v>

1348
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:56.041
<v Speaker 1>possible options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's on an SSRI and he </v>

1349
01:03:56.041 --> 01:04:00.271
<v Speaker 1>recently found out that he had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking propecia and he recently found </v>

1350
01:04:01.541 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>out that propecia actually caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression on,</v>

1351
01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>in some people it can cause depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people.</v>

1352
01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1353
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:12.951
<v Speaker 1>he quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he quit taking propecia and he's </v>

1354
01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>starting to feel like maybe that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause of the depression the first place.</v>

1355
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>But he's unnecessarily now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he has to figure out what to do.</v>

1356
01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

1357
01:04:18.851 --> 01:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>was it the propecia that caused his </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression?</v>

1358
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Was it going to happen anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the SSRI that he needs?</v>

1359
01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>But he also eats a lot of candy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't take care of his body and </v>

1360
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really exercise.</v>

1361
01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a shitty diet.</v>

1362
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>All those things can factor into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low production of Serotonin in your </v>

1363
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things can factor into,</v>

1364
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a clogging of the pathways of </v>

1365
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitter.</v>

1366
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean to omega three fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1367
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent of your brain is made up Dha,</v>

1368
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:56.631
<v Speaker 2>which is an omega three fatty acid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that actually Dha affects </v>

1369
01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:58.260
<v Speaker 2>the way dopamine signaling in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

1370
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:03.261
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of like back to the </v>

1371
01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with schizophrenia,</v>

1372
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:08.870
<v Speaker 2>you ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make dopamine in this frontal part </v>

1373
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 2>of your cortex and the dopamine that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>make there negatively feeds back on,</v>

1374
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>on this dopamine that you make in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>back part of your brain.</v>

1375
01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have that negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback,</v>

1376
01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you start making more in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that back part of your brand,</v>

1377
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.180
<v Speaker 2>you start to have like negative things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like hallucinations and paranoia and </v>

1378
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:23.180
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've shown that Omega three that </v>

1380
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:28.170
<v Speaker 2>they've actually given omega three fatty</v>
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>

1381
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:32.971
<v Speaker 2>Dha to schizophrenia and shown that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually elevates the dopamine and the </v>

1382
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>frontal part of the brain and helps </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate some of that negative feedback,</v>

1383
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like how many people are </v>

1384
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>getting their eating fish every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>day are getting their omega three fatty </v>

1385
01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 2>acids for the brain every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1386
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I know I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty much an exception,</v>

1387
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that are depressed.</v>

1388
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1389
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:58.411
<v Speaker 2>the EPA is another big thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation has been shown to be </v>

1390
01:05:58.411 --> 01:05:58.870
<v Speaker 2>correlated with depression.</v>

1391
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of omega three fatty </v>
<v Speaker 1>acids,</v>

1392
01:06:02.201 --> 01:06:03.900
<v Speaker 1>especially in fish oil form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1393
01:06:03.901 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Lily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make such a huge,</v>

1394
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 1>a difference in how my joints feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inflammation,</v>

1395
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 1>anti inflammation qualities of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really incredible.</v>

1396
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few things that I always</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend to anybody if they tell me </v>

1397
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:18.810
<v Speaker 1>they have knee pain or elbow pain or.</v>

1398
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen studies on how EPA like giving</v>

1399
01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 2>even higher doses of EPA to people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis,</v>

1400
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1401
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:32.491
<v Speaker 2>they're inhibiting some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>production of like arachidonic acid and </v>

1402
01:06:32.491 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>some of these prostoglandins and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are involved in inflammation,</v>

1403
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.880
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're reading,</v>

1404
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting a lot of omega six fatty</v>

1405
01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 2>acids too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1406
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen studies where it like it's </v>

1407
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>been shown to improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1408
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.250
<v Speaker 1>you were looking at this mct oil over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and you were saying that it's </v>

1409
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:47.250
<v Speaker 1>lacking something.</v>

1410
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's interesting because,</v>

1411
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1412
01:06:51.611 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually cook with coconut oil and I,</v>

1413
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:55.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some,</v>

1414
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 2>some periods of my life I'd put it in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>

1415
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1416
01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 2>but coconut oil has lower gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got medium chain triglycerides,</v>

1417
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:08.791
<v Speaker 2>which basically is 12 carbons are less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lipids are just like long chains of </v>

1418
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 2>carbons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1419
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 2>that are bound together with hydrogens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1420
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:18.991
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way your body processes long chain </v>

1421
01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:19.600
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids is very different from short</v>
<v Speaker 2>chain fatty acids.</v>

1422
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>The way it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long chain fatty acids for one,</v>

1423
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I should probably get to that in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

1424
01:07:24.281 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me start with a chain fatty acids.</v>

1425
01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Basically you get your paper and pen </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies.</v>

1426
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Shit's going to go computer then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1427
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.260
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1428
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.020
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you digest,</v>

1429
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.130
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes straight to your portal vein and</v>

1430
01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it goes to your liver.</v>

1431
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it gets,</v>

1432
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.400
<v Speaker 2>goes into the Mitochondria without </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go through this like transport</v>

1433
01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:47.401
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it sort of slightly uncouples the </v>

1434
01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:47.401
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's thermogenic and you know,</v>

1435
01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 2>it has all these great benefits for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria.</v>

1436
01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:55.350
<v Speaker 2>But I'm an interesting thing with Laura </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] acid is that it's also been </v>

1437
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 2>shown to be an appetite suppressant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1438
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>it's through a couple of these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>appetite suppressing hormones.</v>

1439
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I think CCK is one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what that stands for,</v>

1440
01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1441
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:06.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's also antimicrobial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

1442
01:08:06.861 --> 01:08:09.460
<v Speaker 2>it's been shown to kill off Candida </v>
<v Speaker 2>Albicans,</v>

1443
01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:14.461
<v Speaker 2>which is like a yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is 12 carbons and it's a lot of mct </v>

1444
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>oils</v>

1445
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 4>don't have work acid and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't figure out why they </v>

1446
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't want lower gas had because when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take coconut oil I'm like,</v>

1447
01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lord acids,</v>

1448
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:26.540
<v Speaker 4>like the thing that I'm really excited </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1449
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 4>So it's not naturally in coconut oil or </v>
<v Speaker 4>coconut oil,</v>

1450
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:34.690
<v Speaker 4>but these mct oils that people put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together some,</v>

1451
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:37.740
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them don't have acid in it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they'll,</v>

1452
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 4>they'll have like less than 12 carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So [inaudible] acid is a 12 carbon,</v>

1453
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 4>a medium chain fatty acids and medium </v>
<v Speaker 4>chain triglycerides.</v>

1454
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 4>How were they exactly extracted from </v>
<v Speaker 4>coconut oil?</v>

1455
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:53.441
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand the process?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how they do that and </v>

1456
01:08:53.441 --> 01:08:53.441
<v Speaker 4>haven't read about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1457
01:08:53.441 --> 01:08:55.340
<v Speaker 4>there is some process that allows it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this.</v>

1458
01:08:55.341 --> 01:09:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Laura and I spell it l a l a U R I c </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lorac acid acid.</v>

1459
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:01.220
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1460
01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:04.190
<v Speaker 4>I want to make sure that on it starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>making mct oil,</v>

1461
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.560
<v Speaker 4>mct oil with Lauren.</v>

1462
01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:09.040
<v Speaker 4>And what are the benefits of Lorac acid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1463
01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:14.041
<v Speaker 4>specifically for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for combining it with mct oil or making </v>

1464
01:09:14.041 --> 01:09:17.681
<v Speaker 4>sure that it is an mct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the benefits is one is that </v>

1465
01:09:17.681 --> 01:09:18.920
<v Speaker 4>appetite appetite suppressing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And two,</v>

1466
01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 4>it's a very strong antimicrobial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like good for your gut.</v>

1467
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's killing off like yeast.</v>

1468
01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It's been shown to kill off know </v>
<v Speaker 4>Albicans Candida Albicans.</v>

1469
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also has the same thermogenic </v>

1470
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:33.710
<v Speaker 4>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the eight chain,</v>

1471
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.910
<v Speaker 4>a fatty acid tab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll do some mct oils,</v>

1472
01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:37.910
<v Speaker 4>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've seen it.</v>

1473
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:42.240
<v Speaker 4>A lot of mct now haven't done a survey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just look at this one.</v>

1474
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I see that it says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1475
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.960
<v Speaker 4>it says a eight carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medium chain triglycerides from coconut </v>

1476
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.630
<v Speaker 4>and palm kernel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me that says it's not having the 12 </v>

1477
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:55.380
<v Speaker 4>carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is lower acid,</v>

1478
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1479
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:04.690
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that someone said to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were concerned about was that </v>

1480
01:10:04.690 --> 01:10:08.650
<v Speaker 4>it's stored in plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there an issue with plastic leaching </v>

1481
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:13.570
<v Speaker 4>chemicals into things like mct oil?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've shown that certain </v>

1482
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 4>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1483
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:20.350
<v Speaker 4>especially in presence of heat can leach</v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals into whatever is in the </v>

1484
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:24.701
<v Speaker 4>plastic container.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if like that plastic container sits </v>

1485
01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:28.001
<v Speaker 4>in the back seat of your car and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose your roll down or something along </v>

1486
01:10:28.001 --> 01:10:30.791
<v Speaker 4>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always try to keep oils at 44 degrees </v>

1487
01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:33.671
<v Speaker 4>in the frigerator because it slows that </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously the oxidation process and all </v>

1488
01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the heat,</v>

1489
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slowed down.</v>

1490
01:10:36.591 --> 01:10:41.591
<v Speaker 4>So ideally though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which should be stored in it shouldn't </v>

1491
01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:43.880
<v Speaker 4>ideally be stored in plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should it be in a metal?</v>

1492
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.820
<v Speaker 4>Should it be in a class?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1493
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:51.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not a real big concern of mine is I</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't really put any thought into it </v>

1494
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.200
<v Speaker 4>and as long as it's just not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be exposed to heat and long as you're </v>

1495
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 4>reasonably sure that the process from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the storage in the plant,</v>

1496
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:58.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1497
01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.450
<v Speaker 4>the canning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottling,</v>

1498
01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:03.010
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is to storage to store that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1499
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:03.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

1500
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not sitting out in the sun.</v>

1501
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:10.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean is that something that people </v>

1502
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:11.370
<v Speaker 4>were really concerned with Riley with </v>
<v Speaker 4>plastic bpa.</v>

1503
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 4>BPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which can leach into water and stuff.</v>

1504
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A friend,</v>

1505
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.150
<v Speaker 4>his girlfriend went to drink a bottle of</v>
<v Speaker 4>water that was in the car that had,</v>

1506
01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 4>she had sitting in the back seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1507
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:22.740
<v Speaker 4>don't drag it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1508
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:27.741
<v Speaker 4>like it's a fucking bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mom did that to be really the same </v>

1509
01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:27.741
<v Speaker 4>reason?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1510
01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.860
<v Speaker 4>But the plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that something you.</v>

1511
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a bottle of water in sitting</v>

1512
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:36.381
<v Speaker 4>in your car and it's a hot day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should you not drink that bottle of </v>

1513
01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 4>water because it's been sitting in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>

1514
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.450
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not going to kill you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink it once,</v>

1515
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:41.700
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do it all the time.</v>

1516
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:47.150
<v Speaker 4>So what happens to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottle like heats up and then the </v>

1517
01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:50.700
<v Speaker 4>plastics leach out into the water and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it affects hormones in some sort of</v>

1518
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:52.860
<v Speaker 4>a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1519
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an expert on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done a little bit of reading on </v>

1520
01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:58.620
<v Speaker 4>that so I'm not going to claim to be an </v>
<v Speaker 4>expert here.</v>

1521
01:11:58.621 --> 01:12:03.621
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've shown that BPA can have some </v>

1522
01:12:03.621 --> 01:12:05.340
<v Speaker 4>estrogen mimicking effects and know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's particularly,</v>

1523
01:12:05.341 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 4>I think a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in,</v>

1524
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>developing males.</v>

1525
01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:12.921
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to email you this ta 65 </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff because I want you to check it </v>

1526
01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.320
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please check the number,</v>

1527
01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:17.850
<v Speaker 4>but it's about the tele telomere.</v>

1528
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm gonna I'm emailing you that right</v>

1529
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.320
<v Speaker 4>now because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a friend who asked me about it and</v>

1530
01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know and I felt like you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>the perfect person to throw this by.</v>

1531
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.290
<v Speaker 4>And then laura acid going to with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1532
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever buy mct oil myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just use coconut oil.</v>

1533
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 4>So is there a benefit of using coconut </v>
<v Speaker 4>oil over mct oil?</v>

1534
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only if the lord,</v>

1535
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I think lorich acids in a benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the mct oil has lower acid in it.</v>

1536
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.200
<v Speaker 4>What's the benefit of mct oil or coconut</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil?</v>

1537
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 4>I think they just let not having the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other long chain fatty acids in there.</v>

1538
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.290
<v Speaker 4>And that's also in coconut oil would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>those long chain fatty acids.</v>

1539
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fat bad.</v>

1540
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.570
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad fat,</v>

1541
01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:12.050
<v Speaker 4>good fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Debatable,</v>

1542
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:13.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's debatable.</v>

1543
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:15.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

1544
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:18.180
<v Speaker 4>When it comes down to eating a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>

1545
01:13:18.181 --> 01:13:20.110
<v Speaker 4>you obviously need fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean fat,</v>

1546
01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 4>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Need cholesterol for your brain.</v>

1547
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Sixty percent of your brain dry weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that your cell membranes here that </v>

1548
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.440
<v Speaker 4>the vegans out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need cholesterol,</v>

1549
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 4>you need cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say that in my act,</v>

1550
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:38.750
<v Speaker 4>like as a joke about vs that they say </v>
<v Speaker 4>things because they don't get </v>

1551
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.750
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

1552
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've done a little bit of research </v>

1553
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:45.750
<v Speaker 4>and I plan on doing more and actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out with a report on this,</v>

1554
01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.110
<v Speaker 4>but I'll just talk about what I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I planned,</v>

1555
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 4>I like to dig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really dig and make sure I'm </v>

1556
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.140
<v Speaker 4>comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of the,</v>

1557
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 4>when you digest fats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1558
01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:59.910
<v Speaker 4>you have to make bile acids and in order</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make bile to basically be able to </v>

1559
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:05.331
<v Speaker 4>absorb them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of these bile acids that you </v>

1560
01:14:05.331 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 4>make when you digest fat are </v>
<v Speaker 4>carcinogenic.</v>

1561
01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:11.680
<v Speaker 4>So a d deoxycholic acid dca</v>

1562
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1563
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.170
<v Speaker 2>is one that I'm talking about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

1564
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:15.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1565
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:20.130
<v Speaker 2>every time you're eating fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's making this dca which </v>

1566
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:23.791
<v Speaker 2>damages Dna Damage Dna in your eps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your epithelial cells lining your </v>

1567
01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:23.791
<v Speaker 2>intestine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1568
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.590
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of a drawback,</v>

1569
01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean you should stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating fat,</v>

1570
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:33.710
<v Speaker 2>just means you should be aware of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating 60 or 70 percent fat diet that </v>

1571
01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:38.341
<v Speaker 2>you might want to consider some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm effects that could rear their </v>

1572
01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:42.211
<v Speaker 2>head later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also a eating fat increases igf one </v>

1573
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:48.740
<v Speaker 2>a because igf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>igf one is a growth factor and you </v>

1574
01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.201
<v Speaker 2>probably have heard of it because in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitness community it's sort of like a </v>

1575
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:56.221
<v Speaker 2>downstream mediator or growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are always really excited </v>

1576
01:14:56.221 --> 01:14:57.170
<v Speaker 2>about having more igf one because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1577
01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 2>helps you bulk on muscle and on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

1578
01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:06.930
<v Speaker 2>But also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have too much of it that you're </v>

1579
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:06.930
<v Speaker 2>making over a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can.</v>

1580
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a signal that tells,</v>

1581
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:12.440
<v Speaker 2>tell cells to overcome the checkpoints I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about earlier where,</v>

1582
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:17.550
<v Speaker 2>where you have these checkpoints where </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have some damaged DNA that has a </v>

1583
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Speaker 2>mutation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the cell goes,</v>

1584
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:18.910
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time to die.</v>

1585
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 2>But lots of igf one there says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1586
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna keep going.</v>

1587
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's highly correlated with cancer.</v>

1588
01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 1>One Igf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one being in high doses,</v>

1589
01:15:30.491 --> 01:15:35.491
<v Speaker 1>igf one being like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what doses are correlated with </v>

1590
01:15:35.491 --> 01:15:35.590
<v Speaker 1>cancer?</v>

1591
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>

1592
01:15:36.811 --> 01:15:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically people with cancer,</v>

1593
01:15:38.611 --> 01:15:40.010
<v Speaker 2>they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just out of here.</v>

1594
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So people of gigantism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must have an issue with this,</v>

1595
01:15:43.561 --> 01:15:48.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's people that have like they </v>

1596
01:15:48.561 --> 01:15:48.600
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we've,</v>

1597
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had a few of those guys in mixed </v>

1598
01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.331
<v Speaker 1>martial arts that had cancer of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pituitary gland and then they had the </v>

1599
01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:57.660
<v Speaker 1>tumor removed so that they can compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

1600
01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>They were competing overseas and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other organizations.</v>

1601
01:16:01.311 --> 01:16:06.311
<v Speaker 1>I can pry these to allow these guys to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and they would be fucking these </v>

1602
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:08.340
<v Speaker 1>literary giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a guy in the,</v>

1603
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:11.100
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is bigfoot Silva,</v>

1604
01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Antonio bigfoot Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1605
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.400
<v Speaker 1>he has that disease and he had the tumor</v>
<v Speaker 1>removed from his pituitary gland and now</v>

1606
01:16:17.401 --> 01:16:22.401
<v Speaker 1>he functions on a normal basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has to supplement his hormones </v>

1607
01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:24.360
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that a similar thing?</v>

1608
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about like high igf </v>

1609
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:29.540
<v Speaker 1>one is that.</v>

1610
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you're making a lot of growth </v>

1611
01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.691
<v Speaker 2>hormone from your pituitary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean are they make these pds people </v>

1612
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 2>are making a lot of growth hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1613
01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would assume that me,</v>

1614
01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.070
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're heads are so big and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1615
01:16:41.071 --> 01:16:44.410
<v Speaker 1>their bodies are so distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he looks like now.</v>

1616
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>That's after the tumor removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1617
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1618
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:53.810
<v Speaker 1>it's really a fascinating situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you look at the guy and it's </v>

1619
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.990
<v Speaker 1>quite obvious that his body's gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>haywire.</v>

1620
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Skulls enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hands are enormous.</v>

1621
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see what it looks like.</v>

1622
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has all the classic,</v>

1623
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.640
<v Speaker 1>very good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1624
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Actually some people that are making </v>
<v Speaker 2>when your,</v>

1625
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 2>when your pituitary makes growth hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then stimulates the liver to make </v>

1626
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:15.740
<v Speaker 2>igf one that igf one negatively feeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on the pituitary to shut it off,</v>

1627
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:21.010
<v Speaker 2>but people that have that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem don't have that negative </v>

1628
01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 2>feedback and they ended up having all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of problems for one,</v>

1629
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 2>even though igf one can actually make </v>
<v Speaker 2>your muscle cells insulin sensitive,</v>

1630
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:32.110
<v Speaker 2>which is good growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can cause insulin insensitivity in like </v>

1631
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:34.280
<v Speaker 2>your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they ended up getting,</v>

1632
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:35.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>

1633
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insensible insulin,</v>

1634
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:42.671
<v Speaker 2>insensitive liver cells and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a major problem with a it with </v>

1635
01:17:42.671 --> 01:17:47.410
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And aren't there certain amino acids </v>

1636
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.901
<v Speaker 2>that you can take before you go to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will stimulate your body's </v>

1637
01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:50.570
<v Speaker 2>production of growth hormone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1638
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I know that I'm take protein and fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulate the production of igf one.</v>

1639
01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know about certain amino </v>

1640
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:03.160
<v Speaker 2>acids you can take to stimulate growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know.</v>

1641
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1642
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 2>growth hormone can be increased from </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise and also from the sauna.</v>

1643
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:11.360
<v Speaker 2>The Sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1644
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:14.450
<v Speaker 2>the sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this can increase growth hormone</v>

1645
01:18:14.451 --> 01:18:16.400
<v Speaker 2>to massive levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sauna.</v>

1646
01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1647
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good thing to go into a sauna </v>

1648
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:24.341
<v Speaker 2>after your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great thing to go into the sauna </v>

1649
01:18:24.341 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 2>after you work out and it's also a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to go in the sauna when you're not</v>

1650
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:29.351
<v Speaker 2>working out if your muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're injured because that prevents </v>

1651
01:18:29.351 --> 01:18:29.870
<v Speaker 2>a atrophying of muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.780
<v Speaker 2>So definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

1653
01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My husband and I,</v>

1654
01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:37.700
<v Speaker 2>we did some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a report coming out on this,</v>

1655
01:18:37.701 --> 01:18:39.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably in a couple of weeks,</v>

1656
01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:44.171
<v Speaker 2>so I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of yours or I think his might </v>

1657
01:18:44.171 --> 01:18:45.040
<v Speaker 2>publish it on their site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to mind.</v>

1658
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not going to give Tim Tim </v>

1659
01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Ferriss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1660
01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:50.720
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1661
01:18:50.721 --> 01:18:55.721
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to let the cat out of the </v>

1662
01:18:55.721 --> 01:18:55.721
<v Speaker 2>bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did.</v>

1663
01:18:55.721 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 2>My husband and I did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentation with,</v>

1664
01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1665
01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.750
<v Speaker 2>the sauna because we used to live next </v>
<v Speaker 2>door to a why MCA,</v>

1666
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.960
<v Speaker 2>which had a sauna and so we would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go use the sauna like all the time.</v>

1667
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>And aside from all the research that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I did to write this article,</v>

1668
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll just talk about my experience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I was injured,</v>

1669
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:18.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some injuries and I couldn't work </v>

1670
01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 2>out for like a month and I would do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sauna every day and I did not.</v>

1671
01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I was not losing my muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would've,</v>

1672
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't injured.</v>

1673
01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it helped me deal with stress.</v>

1674
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just know Kayla and stress and </v>

1675
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:32.210
<v Speaker 2>being able to focus.</v>

1676
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

1677
01:19:32.251 --> 01:19:37.251
<v Speaker 2>And I'm so glad I talked to you today </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I thought the sauna was </v>

1678
01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:37.251
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1679
01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Was the other day I went to a spa and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a little massage and then they had a</v>

1680
01:19:40.731 --> 01:19:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Jacuzzi and a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1681
01:19:42.591 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 2>who goes in that stupid fucking song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit ain't doing nothing.</v>

1682
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>No hot in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doing so much.</v>

1683
01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Why is it doing something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just getting you hot.</v>

1684
01:19:50.901 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:54.320
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things going on.</v>

1686
01:19:54.321 --> 01:19:55.400
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1687
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1688
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll tweet you the link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

1689
01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because email to me and then I'll tweet </v>

1690
01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 2>it because I'll email it to you could go</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to the abyss.</v>

1691
01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I refresh my feed</v>

1692
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.280
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't find something that somebody </v>

1693
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 4>sent me because it's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1694
01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.540
<v Speaker 4>but the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating thing to me that </v>

1695
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:18.960
<v Speaker 4>because there's infrared Saunas as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1696
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.070
<v Speaker 4>What's the benefit of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:26.160
<v Speaker 4>So I haven't done a ton of research on </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the differences between just a </v>

1698
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.030
<v Speaker 4>normal dry sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which most of the studies that I read,</v>

1699
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 4>they're using normal dry dry sauna is </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

1700
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dry Sauna.</v>

1701
01:20:31.251 --> 01:20:33.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm just just elevating your core body </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature basically.</v>

1702
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1703
01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:39.741
<v Speaker 4>the infrared is somehow can heat you up </v>
<v Speaker 4>without some of the damaging effects of </v>

1704
01:20:39.741 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 4>the heat or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exactly sure.</v>

1705
01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say that I haven't done a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of research on that,</v>

1706
01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.540
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1707
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.300
<v Speaker 4>you can get infrared saunas and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like put them in your garage.</v>

1708
01:20:48.301 --> 01:20:53.301
<v Speaker 4>My inlaws have one in their garage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have one that my wife loves and she </v>

1709
01:20:53.301 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 4>climbs into it.</v>

1710
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a.</v>

1711
01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.600
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those bags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those.</v>

1712
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.600
<v Speaker 4>She looks so stupid there with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got her ipad and she's watching </v>

1713
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 4>breaking bad and she's in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping bag.</v>

1714
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 4>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if that's.</v>

1715
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:15.171
<v Speaker 4>I think to get some of the benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to kind of push it a little </v>

1716
01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:15.171
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if you're gonna.</v>

1717
01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:15.860
<v Speaker 4>She's pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She okay.</v>

1718
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.970
<v Speaker 4>She gets out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like she swam in the ocean.</v>

1719
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:18.940
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1720
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.610
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those on Amazon,</v>

1721
01:21:20.611 --> 01:21:25.611
<v Speaker 4>but I was always curious if that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different one than the image shows a </v>

1722
01:21:25.611 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 4>different one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one that she has,</v>

1723
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:27.480
<v Speaker 4>she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She actually lives down in it.</v>

1724
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.780
<v Speaker 4>It's so silly looking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

1725
01:21:29.781 --> 01:21:33.300
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was horseshit and food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has benefits on the brain.</v>

1726
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 4>Think about when you exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1727
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:41.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're elevating your core </v>

1728
01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:41.151
<v Speaker 4>body temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is.</v>

1729
01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:42.310
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what she has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She clemson that goofy fucking thing and</v>

1730
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 4>not expose their head is out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1731
01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.920
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she needs to get her head in there.</v>

1732
01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:51.921
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell her fucking bag over </v>

1733
01:21:51.921 --> 01:21:51.921
<v Speaker 4>your head lady.</v>

1734
01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it sounds like there's a great </v>

1735
01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.040
<v Speaker 4>benefit to having one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your House if you have room.</v>

1736
01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

1737
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:01.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got a garage,</v>

1738
01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't take up a lot of space.</v>

1739
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

1740
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad I talked to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just went last week to get a </v>

1741
01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.280
<v Speaker 4>massage and just looked at that stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1742
01:22:11.281 --> 01:22:11.930
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ugh,</v>

1743
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:17.270
<v Speaker 4>but hot box wish my gym had one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my gym now doesn't have one and I </v>

1744
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.560
<v Speaker 4>miss it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1745
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:22.740
<v Speaker 4>So how does it stimulate human growth </v>
<v Speaker 4>hormone?</v>

1746
01:22:22.741 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 4>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know how it does.</v>

1747
01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've measured it,</v>

1748
01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:31.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've measured growth hormone after </v>

1749
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:33.261
<v Speaker 4>people have been in the sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is it a temporary benefit of the </v>

1750
01:22:33.261 --> 01:22:34.170
<v Speaker 4>hours after?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like if you were to,</v>

1751
01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jackson growth hormone,</v>

1752
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it lasts more than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of hours either.</v>

1753
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is unbelievably fascinating.</v>

1754
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 4>It is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's an interesting,</v>

1755
01:22:44.761 --> 01:22:46.150
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did write a post on this,</v>

1756
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:50.610
<v Speaker 4>this tradeoff on growth hormone and igf </v>
<v Speaker 4>one a tradeoff and that is,</v>

1757
01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:53.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>growth hormone and igf one are,</v>

1758
01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're considered really good anabolic </v>

1759
01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:58.020
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help you bulk on muscle.</v>

1760
01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Speaker 4>They're also good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good for your brain,</v>

1761
01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:04.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it helps with neurogenesis in your </v>

1762
01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:04.690
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a tradeoff.</v>

1763
01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 4>They've shown that reducing igf</v>

1764
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 2>one signaling in lower organisms like </v>
<v Speaker 2>worms and flies and also in mice extends</v>

1765
01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 2>their lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a mouse and you knock out</v>

1766
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>growth hormone receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can live 50 percent longer.</v>

1767
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Why 50 percent longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like huge increase in lifespan.</v>

1768
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:28.020
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem to make any sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you would think that growth </v>

1769
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:28.020
<v Speaker 2>hormone would be repairing the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue,</v>

1770
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 2>would you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1771
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when people actually in people,</v>

1772
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:38.791
<v Speaker 2>people that have polymorphisms in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>igf one receptor that it's associated </v>

1773
01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like centenarians,</v>

1774
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:43.730
<v Speaker 2>like living to be 92 in 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1776
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.430
<v Speaker 2>that's mostly mediated through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting cancer.</v>

1777
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.830
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1778
01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1779
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.290
<v Speaker 2>there is an interesting trade off and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>

1780
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:54.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1781
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:58.730
<v Speaker 2>in lower organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason is that having that reduced a</v>

1782
01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:01.220
<v Speaker 2>insulin signaling helps them deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress like their,</v>

1783
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 2>they have an increase in gene expression</v>
<v Speaker 2>for various different genes that are,</v>

1784
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant genes like jeans,</v>

1785
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 2>like glutathione reductase and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1786
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also in genes that help them take </v>

1787
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:17.140
<v Speaker 2>care of proteins and increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotrophic factors.</v>

1788
01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if the same benefits are </v>
<v Speaker 2>true in humans and humans.</v>

1789
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>

1790
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.980
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting cancer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of having lower igf one,</v>

1791
01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:32.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the answer about a amino acids </v>

1792
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:33.860
<v Speaker 1>and a growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there was a,</v>

1793
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:36.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a pub med study on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1794
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:41.270
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying that a specific amino </v>

1795
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:42.080
<v Speaker 1>acids such as Arginine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lysine and aura,</v>

1796
01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:47.090
<v Speaker 1>thien orthodox orphanage can stimulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone release when infused </v>

1797
01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:52.191
<v Speaker 1>intravenously or administered orally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A many individuals consume amino acids </v>

1798
01:24:52.191 --> 01:24:56.070
<v Speaker 1>before strength training workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing that this practice accentuates</v>

1799
01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the exercise induced growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>release,</v>

1800
01:24:58.411 --> 01:25:01.290
<v Speaker 1>thereby promoting greater gains in </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass and strength.</v>

1801
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:06.240
<v Speaker 1>That growth growth hormone response to </v>
<v Speaker 1>amino acid administration is a.</v>

1802
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:11.270
<v Speaker 1>has a high degree of inter individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability into it.</v>

1803
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time I ever read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 46.</v>

1804
01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read that word.</v>

1805
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Inter individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great word though.</v>

1806
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Into it individually for individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability and may be altered by </v>

1807
01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:26.220
<v Speaker 1>training status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1808
01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:31.221
<v Speaker 1>sex and diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although a parental administration </v>

1809
01:25:33.001 --> 01:25:34.800
<v Speaker 1>consistently leads to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1810
01:25:34.801 --> 01:25:37.110
<v Speaker 1>not parental parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turell.</v>

1811
01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Parenteral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parenteral.</v>

1812
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.200
<v Speaker 1>What does that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>P A r e n t e r a l what does that word?</v>

1813
01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Parenteral administration considering</v>

1814
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:49.700
<v Speaker 2>tineal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1815
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Is it parents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lineal.</v>

1816
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A R</v>

1817
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:57.750
<v Speaker 1>e n t e r a l any?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1818
01:25:57.751 --> 01:26:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not per ren tr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1819
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.900
<v Speaker 1>let's Google that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lists Is this golden age of information.</v>

1820
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look up in dictionary.</v>

1821
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is administered by or occurring </v>

1822
01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.901
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere in the body than the mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary canal.</v>

1823
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:21.020
<v Speaker 1>What's the elementary corral?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

1824
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Fucking confusing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1825
01:26:25.671 --> 01:26:30.671
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Blahblahblahblahblah leads to </v>

1826
01:26:30.671 --> 01:26:33.251
<v Speaker 1>increased circulating growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a concentration oral doses that are </v>

1827
01:26:33.651 --> 01:26:38.651
<v Speaker 1>great enough to induce significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone release are likely to </v>

1828
01:26:38.651 --> 01:26:42.491
<v Speaker 1>cause stomach discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And diarrhea booms on during exercise </v>

1829
01:26:42.491 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>intensity is also a major determinant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone release.</v>

1830
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Although one study showed that arginine </v>
<v Speaker 1>infusion can heighten the growth hormone</v>

1831
01:26:49.761 --> 01:26:54.761
<v Speaker 1>response to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no studies found that pre exercise oral </v>

1832
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 1>amino acid supplementation augments </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone release further,</v>

1833
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 1>no appropriately appropriately </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted.</v>

1834
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:06.401
<v Speaker 1>Scientific Studies found that oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementation with amino acids which </v>

1835
01:27:06.401 --> 01:27:10.661
<v Speaker 1>are capable of inducing growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>release before strength training </v>

1836
01:27:10.661 --> 01:27:14.231
<v Speaker 1>increases muscle mass and strength to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater extent than the strength </v>

1837
01:27:14.231 --> 01:27:14.231
<v Speaker 1>training alone.</v>

1838
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1839
01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.950
<v Speaker 1>How that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be contradictory,</v>

1840
01:27:18.951 --> 01:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

1841
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1842
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to take a look at the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it says that the administration </v>

1843
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:29.351
<v Speaker 1>consistently leads to increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation of growth hormone </v>

1844
01:27:29.351 --> 01:27:33.401
<v Speaker 1>concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>World doses that are great enough to </v>

1845
01:27:33.401 --> 01:27:37.451
<v Speaker 1>induce significant growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>release are likely to cause stomach </v>

1846
01:27:37.451 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that if you do do that,</v>

1847
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.620
<v Speaker 1>you will get more growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will also get diarrhea,</v>

1848
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't that mean it works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like it means it works.</v>

1849
01:27:45.301 --> 01:27:50.301
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulating growth hormone as an </v>

1850
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:50.301
<v Speaker 1>endpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So how would they know that's where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets confusing,</v>

1852
01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:56.391
<v Speaker 1>whether they know that it increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength or muscle mass to a greater </v>

1853
01:27:56.391 --> 01:28:00.351
<v Speaker 1>extent than the strength training alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of that is variable </v>

1854
01:28:00.351 --> 01:28:00.351
<v Speaker 1>individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually as well,</v>

1855
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:05.500
<v Speaker 1>like what have to do a baseline you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with the person itself and do </v>

1856
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:05.500
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>

1857
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Do their baseline and then what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do without the amino acid and then</v>

1858
01:28:08.491 --> 01:28:13.491
<v Speaker 1>do their what they do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to compare each person to </v>

1859
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:13.491
<v Speaker 1>their own self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1860
01:28:13.491 --> 01:28:14.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1861
01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Because I've had friends that can just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I have a friend who just can't </v>

1862
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking pack on muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy will lift weights all the time.</v>

1863
01:28:21.391 --> 01:28:23.850
<v Speaker 1>He lifts heavy tries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't gain weight.</v>

1864
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:26.430
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just can't pack on muscle.</v>

1865
01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And then I have other friends that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at waits and it will just </v>

1866
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:31.580
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1867
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:36.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have that mesomorphic body </v>

1868
01:28:36.081 --> 01:28:38.601
<v Speaker 1>structure and they start lifting weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their muscles just start expanding </v>

1869
01:28:38.601 --> 01:28:42.051
<v Speaker 1>and growing and they just start getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and other people that they have </v>

1870
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:42.120
<v Speaker 1>that ectomorphic thing going on and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't,</v>

1871
01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 1>they can't pack it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how would you weight those factors </v>

1872
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.010
<v Speaker 1>mean you'd have to know exactly who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

1873
01:28:50.011 --> 01:28:55.011
<v Speaker 1>You didn't really have to judge it </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely by the individual alone.</v>

1874
01:28:55.430 --> 01:29:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the best way to do it is </v>

1875
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.480
<v Speaker 1>comparing each person to them their </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseline self.</v>

1876
01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

1877
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:03.840
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's crazy though.</v>

1878
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:08.841
<v Speaker 2>That growth hormones in mice allow them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live longer than the converse is </v>

1879
01:29:08.841 --> 01:29:08.841
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1880
01:29:08.841 --> 01:29:13.191
<v Speaker 2>if you overexert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make a transgenic mouse and </v>

1881
01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 2>overexpress the growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like third expressing lots of it,</v>

1882
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:17.220
<v Speaker 2>they live 50 percent shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1883
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1884
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting.</v>

1885
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting trade off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1886
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:26.451
<v Speaker 2>because oftentimes growth hormones </v>
<v Speaker 2>except associated with where you want </v>

1887
01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:31.791
<v Speaker 2>more of it because your growth hormone </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels go down as you age and it causes </v>

1888
01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:33.630
<v Speaker 2>muscle atrophy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

1889
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain atrophy and incense too.</v>

1890
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1891
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:39.600
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1892
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to do with more of super </v>

1893
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:48.560
<v Speaker 2>physiological levels of growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that are injecting growth </v>

1894
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.651
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people that are bodies that are </v>

1895
01:29:51.651 --> 01:29:53.991
<v Speaker 2>taking 10 units day that may be a trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and they get those big bellies from </v>

1896
01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:53.991
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:54.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1898
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1899
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:57.350
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1900
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:03.110
<v Speaker 2>when you make growth hormone from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>pituitary and then that stimulates igf </v>

1901
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:06.861
<v Speaker 2>one to be tomato and liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that then inhibits the production of </v>

1902
01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:06.861
<v Speaker 2>more growth hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and that,</v>

1903
01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:09.960
<v Speaker 2>that feedback is there for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you just keep injecting it,</v>

1904
01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:12.060
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of overcoming that feedback </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1905
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:13.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>

1906
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you're giving it growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not making more.</v>

1907
01:30:15.901 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Even though there's igf one there </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1908
01:30:17.401 --> 01:30:18.390
<v Speaker 2>shut it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

1909
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:19.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want more.</v>

1910
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.740
<v Speaker 1>If there's ever been any studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like bodybuilders that are taking</v>

1911
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of growth hormone over </v>
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time because,</v>

1912
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:27.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing,</v>

1913
01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dorian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that guy.</v>

1914
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1915
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's monster.</v>

1916
01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1917
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:37.580
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

1918
01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie Coleman.</v>

1919
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:44.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a former Mr Olympia and I think he </v>

1920
01:30:44.091 --> 01:30:47.901
<v Speaker 1>probably takes a truck load of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical drugs every day in order </v>

1921
01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:49.410
<v Speaker 1>to achieve that physique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his stomach,</v>

1922
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>that's like apparently one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you take massive </v>

1923
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:58.341
<v Speaker 1>amounts of growth hormone is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally bulge out like they're </v>

1924
01:30:58.341 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1925
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see someone study that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what happens to those guys when </v>

1926
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 1>they do that over long for that to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting study.</v>

1927
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bodybuilding industry or the </v>

1928
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.220
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding as a sport is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to me because essentially </v>

1929
01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with these chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects because that's what they are.</v>

1930
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:17.310
<v Speaker 1>They're chemical projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not humans.</v>

1931
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at a guy like Ronnie </v>

1932
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Coleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that big.</v>

1933
01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:25.500
<v Speaker 1>A normal guy doesn't get that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1934
01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:27.020
<v Speaker 1>you can get big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1935
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was a total natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder.</v>

1936
01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:33.450
<v Speaker 1>There's photos of him in his gut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

1937
01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1938
01:31:36.031 --> 01:31:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that that was just big </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach muscles.</v>

1939
01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that he did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ABS,</v>

1940
01:31:40.051 --> 01:31:45.051
<v Speaker 1>so stomach muscles are huge until I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually read that their organs grow </v>

1941
01:31:45.051 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 1>because of all the hormones at their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grass.</v>

1942
01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It looks pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how pregnant he looks.</v>

1943
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>

1944
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1945
01:31:56.121 --> 01:31:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I can cause insulin resistance in</v>

1946
01:31:58.401 --> 01:31:59.540
<v Speaker 2>the liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1947
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 2>people get diabetes</v>

1948
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.500
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from over use of growth hormone.</v>

1949
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there's a whole support </v>

1950
01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:11.161
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to shooting as many chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your body and turn you into some </v>

1951
01:32:11.161 --> 01:32:11.610
<v Speaker 1>freak of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange sport.</v>

1952
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

1953
01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.790
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1954
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:15.360
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit of a tradeoff.</v>

1955
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>These people are bulking up and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting lots of weight and know they're </v>

1956
01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.520
<v Speaker 2>at the trader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the expense of a,</v>

1957
01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years in their life.</v>

1958
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:25.290
<v Speaker 2>So I think</v>

1959
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.310
<v Speaker 1>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

1960
01:32:26.311 --> 01:32:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be huge.</v>

1961
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.730
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1962
01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1963
01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not a bodybuilder.</v>

1964
01:32:36.570 --> 01:32:39.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the studies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been done on,</v>

1965
01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1966
01:32:40.771 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1967
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:44.130
<v Speaker 1>the thing that happens to cows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1968
01:32:44.131 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1969
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:51.420
<v Speaker 1>the exact function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens to </v>

1970
01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 1>whippets and it happens to cows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1971
01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:56.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accidental aspect of,</v>

1972
01:32:56.101 --> 01:33:01.101
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of breeding that causes them to </v>

1973
01:33:01.101 --> 01:33:01.101
<v Speaker 1>Myostatin inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did,</v>

1974
01:33:01.101 --> 01:33:02.520
<v Speaker 1>do you know about all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1975
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:07.610
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to educate you on the </v>

1976
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.610
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happens.</v>

1977
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Pull up miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staten Inhibitor dog.</v>

1978
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a whippet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it occurs like quite </v>

1979
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.400
<v Speaker 1>frequently amongst these dogs and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look real.</v>

1980
01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:20.550
<v Speaker 1>They look like incredible hulk dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

1981
01:33:20.551 --> 01:33:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Is there something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1982
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 1>what does my Stenton do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now my own staten </v>

1983
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:30.300
<v Speaker 1>inhibitor dogs it tour dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that dog.</v>

1984
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Crap.</v>

1985
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Holy Crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

1986
01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm double muscled cattle.</v>

1987
01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:42.421
<v Speaker 1>It happens in cows all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mile stat misfortunes that actually </v>

1988
01:33:42.421 --> 01:33:44.140
<v Speaker 1>occasionally takes place in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

1989
01:33:44.141 --> 01:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>There was a boy in Germany that had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1990
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.180
<v Speaker 1>an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1991
01:33:48.181 --> 01:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:50.980
<v Speaker 1>a milestone and inhibitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll pull that up.</v>

1993
01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Boy in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1994
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Germany and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a cow that has it.</v>

1995
01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done it in mice.</v>

1996
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And the fascinating thing about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm inducing this in mice is that the </v>

1997
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 1>mice lived longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't just live longer.</v>

1998
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like super mice.</v>

1999
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>

2000
01:34:11.741 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a baby.</v>

2001
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking muscles on this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at his legs.</v>

2002
01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like an athlete.</v>

2003
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You pulled up a mouse study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

2004
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the mice.</v>

2005
01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at them ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a double muscle mass that lives </v>

2006
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:26.740
<v Speaker 1>twice as long.</v>

2007
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.960
<v Speaker 2>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely gonna have to look into </v>

2009
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.281
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't know exactly what my </v>

2010
01:34:35.281 --> 01:34:35.281
<v Speaker 2>dad does.</v>

2011
01:34:35.281 --> 01:34:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull up the thing about the mice.</v>

2012
01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they live longer.</v>

2013
01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:45.060
<v Speaker 1>This is hard to do while you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do a podcast at the same time.</v>

2014
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:47.370
<v Speaker 1>This is how we rock it here though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do it live</v>

2015
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:48.300
<v Speaker 2>because usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2016
01:34:48.301 --> 01:34:50.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being bulking up like that is associated</v>

2017
01:34:50.461 --> 01:34:52.880
<v Speaker 2>with living shorter life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:54.660
<v Speaker 2>So that's fascinating.</v>

2019
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2020
01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm here as a Mario Staten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2021
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:01.930
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2022
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.060
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's quite a few studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been done not just on the mice</v>

2023
01:35:07.941 --> 01:35:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but also on dogs and cattle to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this stuff out.</v>

2024
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:18.320
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do a wikipedia,</v>

2025
01:35:18.321 --> 01:35:19.120
<v Speaker 1>just like what</v>

2026
01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the Myostatin I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2027
01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just do it on wikipedia here.</v>

2028
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2029
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>A abbreviated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2030
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.120
<v Speaker 1>milestone and also known as growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

2031
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Differentiation factor eight of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abbreviated GDF eight is a protein that </v>

2032
01:35:38.271 --> 01:35:40.820
<v Speaker 1>in humans is encoded by the m,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

2033
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:46.090
<v Speaker 1>t e n gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milestone is a secreted growth </v>

2034
01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:49.991
<v Speaker 1>differentiation factor that is a member </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Tgf Beta protein family that </v>

2035
01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:55.300
<v Speaker 1>inhibits muscle differentiation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in the process known as </v>

2036
01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:59.680
<v Speaker 1>myogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myostatin is produced primarily in </v>

2037
01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.851
<v Speaker 1>skeletal muscle cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circulates in the blood and acts on </v>

2038
01:36:03.851 --> 01:36:07.630
<v Speaker 1>muscle tissue by binding a cell bound </v>
<v Speaker 1>receptor called the active in type two </v>

2039
01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:12.491
<v Speaker 1>receptor and animals lacking myostatin </v>
<v Speaker 1>or animals treated with substances that </v>

2040
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:17.921
<v Speaker 1>block the activity of Myostatin have </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly larger muscles and this </v>

2041
01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 1>could be of economic benefit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock industry.</v>

2042
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:26.411
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals require special care and </v>

2043
01:36:26.411 --> 01:36:29.021
<v Speaker 1>feeding with ofs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which offsets the potential economic </v>

2044
01:36:29.021 --> 01:36:29.021
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that boy</v>

2045
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't say anything about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifespan.</v>

2046
01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at that boy's body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on there?</v>

2047
01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:40.940
<v Speaker 1>That boy is yoked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not want to go to school with that </v>

2048
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:40.940
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine a bombed out?</v>

2049
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You'd be if you were both 10 and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2050
01:36:42.871 --> 01:36:47.400
<v Speaker 1>why is billy have a fucking 12 pack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked like a girl.</v>

2051
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2052
01:36:52.381 --> 01:36:53.340
<v Speaker 1>what does that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2053
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're going to allow him </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like wrestle and do athletics.</v>

2054
01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:01.320
<v Speaker 1>That seems unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids going to take other kids,</v>

2055
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 1>just fucking hurl them across the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be the Hawk live fire.</v>

2056
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.390
<v Speaker 1>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

2057
01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to dig into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's really interesting.</v>

2058
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to understand some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms.</v>

2059
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the gene encoded Myostatin was </v>

2060
01:37:18.810 --> 01:37:21.081
<v Speaker 1>discovered in 1997 by geneticists doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Jim Lee and Alexander Mcferrin who </v>

2061
01:37:22.531 --> 01:37:27.070
<v Speaker 1>also produced a strain of mutant mice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lack the gene and there's,</v>

2062
01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.480
<v Speaker 1>these mice have approximately twice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much muscle as normal mice.</v>

2063
01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

2064
01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.270
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know why it happens all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and whippets that dog,</v>

2066
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that one whip it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does happen in humans.</v>

2067
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really amazing stuff.</v>

2068
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2069
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.480
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of things,</v>

2070
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:48.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2071
01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you wonder what is that the </v>

2072
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 1>mouse is body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they killed it?</v>

2073
01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.260
<v Speaker 1>They killed it just to show us its </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

2074
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:57.800
<v Speaker 1>but how can we kick off the skin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2075
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 1>How rude could have just taken a </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

2076
01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to forget fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2077
01:38:06.101 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who,</v>

2078
01:38:07.951 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mile staten dogs,</v>

2079
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:15.411
<v Speaker 1>apparently they sucked as runners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their appearance with significantly </v>

2080
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:16.470
<v Speaker 1>more muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 1>They still fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2082
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:21.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about muscle and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue that comes up and mixed martial</v>

2083
01:38:21.091 --> 01:38:26.091
<v Speaker 1>arts all the time and I talk about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time in commentary is that you can't</v>

2084
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.520
<v Speaker 1>just pack on all that muscle and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sort of A.</v>

2085
01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a point of diminishing returns.</v>

2086
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:36.360
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have some muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more muscle you have,</v>

2087
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:41.420
<v Speaker 1>the more you have a muscle that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding fuel and you have the same </v>

2088
01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:45.981
<v Speaker 1>heart and the lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pumping out two more tissue and it </v>

2089
01:38:45.981 --> 01:38:46.410
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of resources.</v>

2090
01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 1>You have only a finite amount of oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can take in a single breath and</v>

2091
01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it's distributed through all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>

2092
01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:58.490
<v Speaker 1>all this extra muscle and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really has a significant factor on </v>

2093
01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 1>people's in endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in athletics.</v>

2094
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:08.110
<v Speaker 1>We got that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real human that's not photo </v>

2095
01:39:08.110 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 1>shopped at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2096
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It might not be mad what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might not be photoshop man.</v>

2097
01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:16.500
<v Speaker 1>What they can do today is just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2098
01:39:16.501 --> 01:39:19.160
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they live longer.</v>

2099
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 1>They don't live long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a milestone guy.</v>

2100
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:27.800
<v Speaker 1>That's just a guy taking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a milestone and </v>

2101
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:27.800
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2102
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's ever been a human </v>

2103
01:39:31.190 --> 01:39:31.190
<v Speaker 1>that's lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really recent thing.</v>

2104
01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking interesting to see what </v>

2105
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:37.920
<v Speaker 1>their mitochondria are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2106
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.900
<v Speaker 1>your Mitochondria or when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising,</v>

2107
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:44.901
<v Speaker 1>when you're bulking up muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're inducing mitochondrial </v>

2108
01:39:44.901 --> 01:39:44.901
<v Speaker 1>biogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really,</v>

2109
01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.940
<v Speaker 1>definitely not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Real.</v>

2110
01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2111
01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>There's been a couple cases where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've documented children have it in </v>

2112
01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 1>2004 German boy who was diagnosed with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutation in both copies of the milestone</v>

2113
01:39:56.791 --> 01:40:01.791
<v Speaker 1>and producing gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making him considerably stronger than </v>

2114
01:40:01.791 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 1>his peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mother has a mutation in one copy of</v>

2115
01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:07.311
<v Speaker 1>the gene and in then in 2005 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>American boy was diagnosed with </v>

2116
01:40:07.311 --> 01:40:09.990
<v Speaker 1>clinically similar condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with somewhat different cause.</v>

2117
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.890
<v Speaker 1>His body produces a normal level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional milestone,</v>

2118
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but because he is stronger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscular than most others his age,</v>

2119
01:40:16.591 --> 01:40:21.330
<v Speaker 1>the doctors believed that a defect in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his milestone and receptors prevents his</v>

2120
01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 1>muscle cells from a responding normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mild staten.</v>

2121
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And that is what I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are trying to develop a </v>

2122
01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.161
<v Speaker 1>milestone and inhibitor and that mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>staten producing stat and regulating the</v>

2123
01:40:34.801 --> 01:40:39.801
<v Speaker 1>size of your muscle tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could come up with a mile stat </v>

2124
01:40:39.801 --> 01:40:42.471
<v Speaker 1>inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would increase the size of your </v>

2125
01:40:42.471 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a good thing.</v>

2126
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:48.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't seem like it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it would help some people </v>

2127
01:40:48.651 --> 01:40:53.451
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have like wasting disease or </v>

2128
01:40:53.451 --> 01:40:56.091
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's going to be really interesting </v>

2129
01:40:56.091 --> 01:41:00.541
<v Speaker 1>though that when they start coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like gene doping for that and they </v>

2130
01:41:00.541 --> 01:41:04.591
<v Speaker 1>start giving it to wrestlers or football</v>
<v Speaker 1>players or things along those lines </v>

2131
01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:08.610
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>affects the body so significantly as you</v>

2132
01:41:08.651 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>see those mice or those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dogs,</v>

2133
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.970
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to take that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some online.</v>

2134
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy with lining up right now </v>

2135
01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:22.020
<v Speaker 1>with is we willie and his pants and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to just shoot that in there and </v>

2136
01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>make up for everything and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade off.</v>

2137
01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:26.050
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cares.</v>

2138
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you follow genetic manipulation or </v>

2139
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.820
<v Speaker 1>studies on genetic manipulation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for what they're,</v>

2140
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:36.060
<v Speaker 1>where they're figuring out these days </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

2141
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it seems incredible and it seems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future is going to be so bizarre </v>

2142
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:45.510
<v Speaker 1>when you deal with the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2143
01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the exponential increase in the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to,</v>

2144
01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>to change things and to alter the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>body is just going to continue as long </v>

2145
01:41:53.321 --> 01:41:57.370
<v Speaker 1>as society allows this research to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue as long as society allows,</v>

2146
01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as we don't blow ourselves up.</v>

2147
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 1>This work is gonna continue to go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be more breakthroughs.</v>

2148
01:42:03.311 --> 01:42:07.570
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be more significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases in the capacity for change and</v>

2149
01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:11.410
<v Speaker 1>know who knows what the fuck is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like just a decade,</v>

2150
01:42:11.411 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 1>two decades from now.</v>

2151
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see some,</v>

2152
01:42:13.811 --> 01:42:18.811
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already made some major advances </v>

2153
01:42:18.811 --> 01:42:20.891
<v Speaker 2>in the stem cell research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to me is one of the most </v>

2154
01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:20.891
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:24.311
<v Speaker 2>because if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can get to the point where we can </v>

2156
01:42:24.311 --> 01:42:25.580
<v Speaker 2>replace our damaged motor neurons or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2157
01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.850
<v Speaker 2>make sure we're not getting Parkinson's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2158
01:42:28.851 --> 01:42:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a huge,</v>

2159
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:31.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2160
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:33.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge thing in,</v>

2161
01:42:33.641 --> 01:42:37.670
<v Speaker 2>in helping us extend the quality of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2162
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2163
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:41.570
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want an urge to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupt disease.</v>

2164
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2165
01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.950
<v Speaker 2>that's something that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's certain things you can do</v>

2166
01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:48.770
<v Speaker 2>and you're in your lifestyle to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>not get one.</v>

2167
01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be,</v>

2168
01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:53.270
<v Speaker 2>it'd be pretty sweet to have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic breakthroughs in these stem cell</v>

2169
01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.210
<v Speaker 2>therapies and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're making progress.</v>

2170
01:42:56.211 --> 01:42:57.410
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not there yet.</v>

2171
01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see a study on someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who follows the exact protocol that </v>

2172
01:43:05.301 --> 01:43:10.301
<v Speaker 1>science that someone like you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribe to him or her and that they do</v>

2173
01:43:10.701 --> 01:43:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it over a long period of time and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a twin that doesn't.</v>

2174
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2175
01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:20.650
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do some of those studies where </v>

2176
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:22.451
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at specific things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific vitamins or exercise or things </v>

2177
01:43:22.451 --> 01:43:27.071
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a long term study where you're </v>

2178
01:43:27.071 --> 01:43:28.160
<v Speaker 2>looking at multiple changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see that as well.</v>

2179
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One person drinks,</v>

2180
01:43:29.451 --> 01:43:33.230
<v Speaker 2>one person doesn't one person's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this study they did in monkeys,</v>

2181
01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a 27 year experiment I </v>

2182
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:38.260
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2183
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:43.240
<v Speaker 2>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so caloric restriction is known to </v>

2184
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.571
<v Speaker 2>extend lifespan in lower organisms and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also in this monkey monkeys they did,</v>

2185
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if you give a,</v>

2186
01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>give a monkey 30 percent food than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would normally eat.</v>

2187
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:56.870
<v Speaker 2>So you basically let the monkey decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it would eat and then you say,</v>

2188
01:43:56.871 --> 01:43:57.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

2189
01:43:57.650 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give them 30 percent less </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

2190
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:00.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

2191
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And they did this for like 27 years.</v>

2192
01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you pull it?</v>

2193
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Can you do a google search on caloric </v>
<v Speaker 2>restriction monkeys?</v>

2194
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.260
<v Speaker 2>And just like pull up the image that </v>
<v Speaker 2>compares them a big impact.</v>

2195
01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.630
<v Speaker 2>So it has a huge impact on the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>age these monkeys are.</v>

2196
01:44:14.631 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 2>They get age related diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less cardiovascular disease.</v>

2197
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:23.201
<v Speaker 2>Last cancer brain atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nurse of diseases less with a </v>

2198
01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:27.460
<v Speaker 2>significantly smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the monkeys were not significantly </v>

2199
01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they looked significantly better.</v>

2200
01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:33.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's cruises worked better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one picture,</v>

2202
01:44:34.431 --> 01:44:39.431
<v Speaker 2>I think there's one where they're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Pam was on one of the writers obese </v>

2203
01:44:39.431 --> 01:44:40.340
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2204
01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:45.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there had picked up that one with the </v>

2205
01:44:45.341 --> 01:44:45.341
<v Speaker 2>four panel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2206
01:44:45.341 --> 01:44:45.341
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2207
01:44:45.341 --> 01:44:49.811
<v Speaker 2>these monkeys are actually the same age </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and that monkey on the left a </v>

2208
01:44:49.811 --> 01:44:53.740
<v Speaker 2>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in its old age 27 and a half years </v>

2209
01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's had a normal day.</v>

2210
01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just eaten what its normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of food and that monkey on the </v>

2211
01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.211
<v Speaker 2>right has been given 30 percent less </v>
<v Speaker 2>food everyday for like it's 27 point </v>

2212
01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:01.460
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's incredible.</v>

2213
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Better.</v>

2214
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can just tell by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks he's aging better,</v>

2215
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:08.720
<v Speaker 2>but he also seemed body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually he looks more muscular.</v>

2216
01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

2217
01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's lost less muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less much muscle atrophy.</v>

2218
01:45:14.450 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what they found,</v>

2219
01:45:16.161 --> 01:45:20.000
<v Speaker 2>they've done like these gene profiling </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression arrays where they can measure</v>

2220
01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:25.001
<v Speaker 2>like thousands of different genes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>once and they've seen that caloric </v>

2221
01:45:25.001 --> 01:45:27.140
<v Speaker 2>restricting actually change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression in like thousands of genes.</v>

2222
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:32.560
<v Speaker 2>So it helps like genes that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>in protein degradation,</v>

2223
01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:38.261
<v Speaker 2>protein synthesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all these things are changed and </v>

2224
01:45:38.261 --> 01:45:38.480
<v Speaker 2>these caloric restriction monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes that are involved in like,</v>

2225
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth factors in the brain,</v>

2226
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:44.240
<v Speaker 2>those are upregulated at inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>genes are downregulated.</v>

2227
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 2>27 years left less have constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation going on.</v>

2229
01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:52.700
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting how,</v>

2230
01:45:52.701 --> 01:45:57.701
<v Speaker 2>and there's a couple of theories as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>why these monkeys age better or why </v>

2231
01:45:57.701 --> 01:45:57.701
<v Speaker 2>calorie restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2232
01:45:57.701 --> 01:45:59.930
<v Speaker 2>is can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can help the way you age.</v>

2233
01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the big theories out there is</v>

2234
01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:06.941
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of like a hormetic </v>

2235
01:46:06.941 --> 01:46:08.441
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hormesis is basically where you have </v>

2236
01:46:08.441 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like a low level of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of stress,</v>

2237
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.580
<v Speaker 2>and that stress then helps you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2238
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.560
<v Speaker 2>changes the expression of genes that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in stress.</v>

2239
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:17.570
<v Speaker 2>And so you basically can then deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress later.</v>

2240
01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:22.571
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like conditioning your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body to deal with stress by giving it a </v>

2241
01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:22.571
<v Speaker 2>little bit of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2242
01:46:22.571 --> 01:46:26.520
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of like xenobiotics like plant,</v>

2243
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:29.000
<v Speaker 2>polyphenols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catechins,</v>

2244
01:46:29.001 --> 01:46:30.050
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things.</v>

2245
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:32.210
<v Speaker 2>That's how they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually,</v>

2246
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:37.900
<v Speaker 2>they induced this hormetic response </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they increase the expression of </v>

2247
01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.870
<v Speaker 2>stress resistant genes that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our body that help us deal with protein </v>

2248
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:41.510
<v Speaker 2>stress with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2249
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.160
<v Speaker 2>reactive oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>

2250
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:44.870
<v Speaker 2>stress with all this different types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

2251
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And because we're increasing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of those genes were dealing </v>

2252
01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:51.210
<v Speaker 2>with stress better every single know </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day in that,</v>

2253
01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:52.170
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2254
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 2>for 27 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2255
01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:56.890
<v Speaker 2>and so it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2256
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.120
<v Speaker 2>this whole idea of hormesis is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting where you're sort of giving </v>

2257
01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.391
<v Speaker 2>your body a little bit of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like exercise is stress and it's a </v>

2258
01:47:05.391 --> 01:47:05.391
<v Speaker 2>little bit of stress and it does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2259
01:47:05.391 --> 01:47:09.440
<v Speaker 2>But that whole field of epigenetics is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just so fascinating how you know,</v>

2260
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:14.450
<v Speaker 2>things that you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do can actually change the </v>

2261
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:17.931
<v Speaker 2>expression of genes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this actually affects the way you </v>

2262
01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:17.931
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>

2263
01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And really what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only does it affect the way you age,</v>

2264
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 2>it affects the way your children that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't had yet age,</v>

2265
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so are you familiar with what </v>

2266
01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:28.280
<v Speaker 2>epigenetics is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2267
01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So basically it's explaining it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that might not be.</v>

2268
01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:33.710
<v Speaker 2>So epigenetics is basically causing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>change in your and your gene.</v>

2269
01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Are there factors that sit on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your genes?</v>

2270
01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Basically to give you a very simplistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>topical view,</v>

2271
01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:44.730
<v Speaker 2>they sit on top of your jeans and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>methyl groups are acetylation groups and</v>

2272
01:47:44.731 --> 01:47:47.040
<v Speaker 2>they turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they activate your genes.</v>

2273
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Then when they activate your genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turn them on.</v>

2274
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:51.450
<v Speaker 2>And so the genes become what's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>express.</v>

2275
01:47:51.451 --> 01:47:53.970
<v Speaker 2>They're expressing the genes when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are expressing the genes,</v>

2276
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:59.210
<v Speaker 2>they're doing what they're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and other factors can sit on top of </v>

2277
01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:00.180
<v Speaker 2>them and turn them off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though the gene is still there,</v>

2278
01:48:00.181 --> 01:48:03.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's not there because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not being expressed.</v>

2279
01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 2>But these epigenetic factors don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually alter the DNA nucleotide </v>

2280
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:10.080
<v Speaker 2>sequence like a mutation would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the difference.</v>

2281
01:48:10.081 --> 01:48:12.630
<v Speaker 2>And mutation changes the DNA nucleotide </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence,</v>

2282
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing can be modulated.</v>

2283
01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.870
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't change the sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2284
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:21.120
<v Speaker 2>it changes how much of that gene is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being active or not active.</v>

2285
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these epigenetic marks are regulated</v>

2286
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:26.040
<v Speaker 2>by what we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by stress,</v>

2287
01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:31.041
<v Speaker 2>by exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by all these various factors in our </v>

2288
01:48:31.041 --> 01:48:31.041
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2289
01:48:31.041 --> 01:48:35.750
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one study where they've changed </v>

2290
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.750
<v Speaker 2>in gene expression from calorie </v>
<v Speaker 2>restriction.</v>

2291
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:36.300
<v Speaker 2>They've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2292
01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:39.300
<v Speaker 2>and I heard someone on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this study.</v>

2293
01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm the sweetest Swedish study that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a few of them that have </v>

2294
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:45.240
<v Speaker 2>been done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2295
01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 2>where in Sweden they keep like extensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>records of people's,</v>

2296
01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:51.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:54.450
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's records of what they eat,</v>

2298
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 2>what diseases they've had throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>

2299
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:57.990
<v Speaker 2>when they were born and if they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed,</v>

2300
01:48:57.991 --> 01:48:58.680
<v Speaker 2>what they died of.</v>

2301
01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very extensive records on people</v>

2302
01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 2>and also they have extensive like </v>
<v Speaker 2>agricultural records.</v>

2303
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.180
<v Speaker 2>So they can say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during this part of,</v>

2304
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country at this time of the year </v>

2305
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:11.480
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of famine or there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>

2306
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a great crop harvest.</v>

2307
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And so particularly this northern part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Sweden called nor buttons.</v>

2308
01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in,</v>

2309
01:49:18.571 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked back,</v>

2310
01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during this period of time for whatever </v>

2311
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:26.640
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was hard to get in and out of there.</v>

2312
01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And so people really dependent on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crops that were there.</v>

2313
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So if there was good a lot of crops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good harvest,</v>

2314
01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:34.110
<v Speaker 2>people really gorge themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eight they overeat.</v>

2315
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 2>And if people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the harvest was bad,</v>

2316
01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a famine and people really,</v>

2317
01:49:38.641 --> 01:49:40.200
<v Speaker 2>they sort of are calorie restricted.</v>

2318
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:45.260
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically didn't get to eat as </v>

2319
01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.111
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of these Swedish sciences </v>

2320
01:49:48.111 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 2>have looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists decided to look back and see,</v>

2321
01:49:48.551 --> 01:49:51.130
<v Speaker 2>well what effects did that have on </v>
<v Speaker 2>future generations?</v>

2322
01:49:51.131 --> 01:49:56.131
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like is there a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgenerational epigenetic effect on </v>

2323
01:49:56.321 --> 01:50:01.321
<v Speaker 2>longevity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at these people that grew </v>

2324
01:50:01.321 --> 01:50:04.501
<v Speaker 2>up during the famine versus feast years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's look at their children and </v>

2325
01:50:04.501 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 2>their grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what diseases they had or what,</v>

2326
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>how long they lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2327
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not like incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a controlled study.</v>

2328
01:50:10.241 --> 01:50:15.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very correlative and there's a lot </v>

2329
01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:15.241
<v Speaker 2>of factors missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still very interesting.</v>

2330
01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they found is that,</v>

2331
01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:19.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>males that were between the ages of nine</v>

2332
01:50:19.361 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 2>and 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they lived during the,</v>

2333
01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.280
<v Speaker 2>if they were nine and 12 during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>famine years,</v>

2334
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.700
<v Speaker 2>they had children and grandchildren that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived on average about seven years </v>

2335
01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.800
<v Speaker 2>longer than the grandchildren of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>that grew up during the,</v>

2336
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:37.180
<v Speaker 2>the abundance years and when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrected for socioeconomic status,</v>

2337
01:50:37.181 --> 01:50:37.870
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2338
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:39.940
<v Speaker 2>rich people kind of well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>

2339
01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:45.180
<v Speaker 2>when you correct for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have people from the same </v>

2340
01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:45.180
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2341
01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 2>those are grandchildren of the men that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were between the ages of nine to 12 </v>

2342
01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.050
<v Speaker 2>during the famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years lived 32 years longer,</v>

2343
01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:54.190
<v Speaker 2>which is like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a increase in lifespan.</v>

2344
01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:59.490
<v Speaker 2>And they also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had more studies coming out where </v>

2345
01:50:59.490 --> 01:51:01.231
<v Speaker 2>those grandchildren had were one fourth </v>
<v Speaker 2>less likely to get a type two diabetes </v>

2346
01:51:01.231 --> 01:51:03.430
<v Speaker 2>and also cardiovascular diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2347
01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to be between the age of</v>

2348
01:51:06.581 --> 01:51:09.370
<v Speaker 2>nine and 12 and a male to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2349
01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 2>why growing up during that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>famine,</v>

2350
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:16.450
<v Speaker 2>how does that affect your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your grandchildren's lifespan?</v>

2351
01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't really tell you why,</v>

2352
01:51:18.821 --> 01:51:20.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's some sort of theories as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

2353
01:51:20.531 --> 01:51:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time period,</v>

2354
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2355
01:51:23.021 --> 01:51:24.520
<v Speaker 2>your pre pubescent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2356
01:51:24.521 --> 01:51:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Right before you actually get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that growth spurt and uh,</v>

2357
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:33.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think there's something to do with </v>

2358
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:33.070
<v Speaker 2>the sperm DNA that gets changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of stress,</v>

2359
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:34.860
<v Speaker 2>that little bit of Hormesis Po possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2360
01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:38.460
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of stress changes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression in your genes,</v>

2361
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.900
<v Speaker 2>sperm genes and that gets passed on.</v>

2362
01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so much to learn still about the </v>

2363
01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.881
<v Speaker 2>human body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're in a great time in </v>

2364
01:51:50.881 --> 01:51:54.901
<v Speaker 2>comparison to other civilizations when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look back and what they used to do </v>

2365
01:51:55.151 --> 01:51:57.370
<v Speaker 2>for medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're aware of now,</v>

2366
01:51:57.670 --> 01:52:00.610
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like 100 years now they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be laughing at us,</v>

2367
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:01.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:02.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

2369
01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:08.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the future is preventative </v>

2370
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:08.880
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.820
<v Speaker 2>and there's gonna be some breakthroughs </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually and things like stem cell </v>

2372
01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:11.820
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think diet,</v>

2373
01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and these things are what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do now.</v>

2374
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:18.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what we can do now we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over and it absolutely has been </v>

2375
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:21.490
<v Speaker 2>shown to affect the way we age period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we know this.</v>

2376
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:23.140
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's implement it.</v>

2377
01:52:23.141 --> 01:52:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Let's educate people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it,</v>

2378
01:52:24.491 --> 01:52:29.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to waiting around for some </v>

2379
01:52:29.491 --> 01:52:30.520
<v Speaker 2>scientific breakthrough that may or may </v>
<v Speaker 2>not happen in your child's,</v>

2380
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during your child's lifetime.</v>

2381
01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:37.831
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no telling you know what's </v>

2382
01:52:37.831 --> 01:52:41.071
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we do know right now that we can </v>

2383
01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:41.071
<v Speaker 2>control certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2384
01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:43.240
<v Speaker 2>and the way we age through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through our diet and our lifestyle.</v>

2385
01:52:43.241 --> 01:52:44.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2386
01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what we need to start</v>

2387
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.280
<v Speaker 4>focusing on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2388
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I want to mention another really cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing about this epigenetic.</v>

2389
01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Turn the microphone a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards you.</v>

2390
01:52:52.191 --> 01:52:53.300
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2391
01:52:53.410 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2392
01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm back to the epigenetics.</v>

2393
01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:01.770
<v Speaker 4>A study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something even as complex like learning </v>

2394
01:53:01.770 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 4>and memory can be modulated by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by your environment.</v>

2395
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.320
<v Speaker 4>And this was a mouse study where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>took mice that were transgenically a </v>

2396
01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.970
<v Speaker 4>modulator to get neurodegenerative </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

2397
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:16.570
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they put these mice usually when we </v>

2398
01:53:16.570 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 4>work with mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in this cage has bedding,</v>

2399
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:19.800
<v Speaker 4>it has some food and water and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

2400
01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of exercise.</v>

2401
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really kind of sad,</v>

2402
01:53:24.351 --> 01:53:29.351
<v Speaker 4>but they took these mice and they put </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in what we call an enriched </v>

2403
01:53:29.351 --> 01:53:32.621
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they give them all these toys that </v>

2404
01:53:32.621 --> 01:53:32.621
<v Speaker 4>stimulated various regions in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

2405
01:53:32.621 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 4>like the cognitive region,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motor region,</v>

2406
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:35.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somata sensory regions.</v>

2407
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.200
<v Speaker 4>And what they found was that these mice </v>
<v Speaker 4>scored better on learning and memory </v>

2408
01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:44.351
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not only did they score better on </v>

2409
01:53:44.351 --> 01:53:44.351
<v Speaker 4>learning memory tests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2410
01:53:44.351 --> 01:53:48.810
<v Speaker 4>they had increased the expression of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gene that's involved in longterm </v>

2411
01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:51.610
<v Speaker 4>potentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Longterm potentiation is that signal </v>

2412
01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:52.730
<v Speaker 4>that you're making when you're learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to remember things,</v>

2413
01:53:52.731 --> 01:53:57.731
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the really interesting thing about </v>

2414
01:53:57.731 --> 01:53:59.951
<v Speaker 4>this study was that these mice that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>genetically engineered to get </v>

2415
01:53:59.951 --> 01:54:03.491
<v Speaker 4>neurodegenerative disease had offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mice that were also genetically </v>

2416
01:54:03.491 --> 01:54:07.421
<v Speaker 4>engineered to get an urgent or disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not put in an enriched </v>

2417
01:54:07.421 --> 01:54:10.511
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were putting that boring cage </v>

2418
01:54:10.511 --> 01:54:12.881
<v Speaker 4>where they had no stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had still increased that </v>

2419
01:54:12.881 --> 01:54:15.680
<v Speaker 4>longterm potentiation gene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that epigenetic factor was passed on.</v>

2420
01:54:16.210 --> 01:54:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this case it was through the egg,</v>

2421
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 4>through the female line to the offspring</v>
<v Speaker 4>mice,</v>

2422
01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.780
<v Speaker 4>which had the same learning memory </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits even though they didn't really,</v>

2423
01:54:24.781 --> 01:54:26.000
<v Speaker 4>they weren't exposed to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2424
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:27.290
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2425
01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:32.291
<v Speaker 4>just having cognitive stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just using your brain more and </v>

2426
01:54:32.291 --> 01:54:34.070
<v Speaker 4>exercising more can affect the </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression of your genes.</v>

2427
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:38.300
<v Speaker 4>And that can actually get passed on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is so fascinating.</v>

2428
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:44.510
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why athletes tend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>develop athletes for children is that </v>

2429
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:48.041
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons we're really </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people tend to have </v>

2430
01:54:48.041 --> 01:54:50.441
<v Speaker 4>intelligent children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like is possibly not just environmental </v>

2431
01:54:50.441 --> 01:54:51.410
<v Speaker 4>and educational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but epigenetics as well.</v>

2432
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.440
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean certainly in the environment </v>

2433
01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:56.440
<v Speaker 4>plays a component and those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2434
01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the epigenetics,</v>

2435
01:54:57.261 --> 01:55:02.261
<v Speaker 4>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're just sort of starting to </v>

2436
01:55:02.261 --> 01:55:02.261
<v Speaker 4>understand epigenetics and how it works </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's complicated.</v>

2437
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:03.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not easy to study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2438
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:04.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2439
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:07.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certainly a role for,</v>

2440
01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 4>for epigentics and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

2441
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.020
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fascinating.</v>

2442
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:17.980
<v Speaker 4>It's very fascinating and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating when you stop and think </v>

2443
01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.700
<v Speaker 4>about how much we're going to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2444
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 4>what we know now and what we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn.</v>

2445
01:55:21.111 --> 01:55:24.590
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just incredible.</v>

2446
01:55:24.650 --> 01:55:29.180
<v Speaker 4>You just think of the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 4>reengineering the human body.</v>

2447
01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:30.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2448
01:55:30.141 --> 01:55:32.840
<v Speaker 4>it seems like we're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do all these things we're doing to mice,</v>

2449
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:36.050
<v Speaker 4>given them double muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making them fucking smarter,</v>

2450
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:37.880
<v Speaker 4>where we're going to be able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>to people.</v>

2451
01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:41.330
<v Speaker 4>We're going to make a doctor Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 4>number from that movie,</v>

2452
01:55:41.331 --> 01:55:43.260
<v Speaker 4>the watchman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to make a document and going</v>

2453
01:55:43.261 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 4>to happen.</v>

2454
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a guy one day that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnipresent super being that,</v>

2455
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:50.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a God.</v>

2456
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.870
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fuck up and make a god.</v>

2457
01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:53.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2458
01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do what I can to make myself </v>

2459
01:55:58.930 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 2>work better and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive wise and you know,</v>

2460
01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 2>and also tried to basically age better </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2461
01:56:05.671 --> 01:56:06.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly like we,</v>

2462
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:08.850
<v Speaker 2>we can do things like now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2463
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.320
<v Speaker 2>but just yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>

2464
01:56:10.321 --> 01:56:12.990
<v Speaker 2>genetically changing someone's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally like,</v>

2465
01:56:13.330 --> 01:56:14.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

2466
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.690
<v Speaker 2>making someone's muscle grow like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>by like giving them an inhibitor of this</v>

2467
01:56:17.691 --> 01:56:21.900
<v Speaker 2>certain milestone and receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like hardcore stuff that,</v>

2468
01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know what the effects </v>

2469
01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:27.740
<v Speaker 2>are going to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>

2470
01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Longterm comes down army of super </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

2471
01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Dr Manhattan,</v>

2472
01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:37.051
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's going to be running shit 100 </v>

2473
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:37.051
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our new president,</v>

2474
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as he's really intelligent,</v>

2475
01:56:40.461 --> 01:56:42.350
<v Speaker 2>let's make his brain like super awesome.</v>

2476
01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Dr Manhattan was really intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately to intelligent,</v>

2477
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:48.290
<v Speaker 1>so intelligent that he sorta like </v>
<v Speaker 1>factored in a lot of things like,</v>

2478
01:56:48.291 --> 01:56:48.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2479
01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:50.270
<v Speaker 1>people live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people die,</v>

2480
01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:55.440
<v Speaker 1>you no remorse and guilt and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are really just byproducts of </v>

2481
01:56:55.490 --> 01:56:58.870
<v Speaker 1>human culture and our correlation to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2482
01:56:58.950 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 1>a cause and effect and our reactions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2483
01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:04.940
<v Speaker 1>They mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took away all the joy and fun.</v>

2484
01:57:04.941 --> 01:57:07.310
<v Speaker 1>The zest of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a little bit too intelligent.</v>

2485
01:57:08.210 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 1>That problem's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2486
01:57:10.431 --> 01:57:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I would make people just smart enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not too smart.</v>

2487
01:57:13.251 --> 01:57:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Whether they realize what's the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2488
01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:16.490
<v Speaker 1>You live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

2489
01:57:16.491 --> 01:57:18.800
<v Speaker 1>You're just a finite organism and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live forever,</v>

2490
01:57:18.801 --> 01:57:21.080
<v Speaker 1>the planet doesn't live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you.</v>

2491
01:57:21.081 --> 01:57:23.730
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2492
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2493
01:57:24.861 --> 01:57:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I've had conversations with really </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people.</v>

2494
01:57:26.781 --> 01:57:28.550
<v Speaker 1>They talk about the futility of life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2495
01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.880
<v Speaker 1>you probably might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too fucking smart and you think </v>

2496
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:33.880
<v Speaker 1>it too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe not even too smart,</v>

2497
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.501
<v Speaker 1>but you're thinking too much about stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really you can't control and maybe </v>

2498
01:57:38.501 --> 01:57:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you got to be smart enough to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is all silly.</v>

2499
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about the things you can't </v>

2500
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.470
<v Speaker 2>control sometimes that that overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get these,</v>

2501
01:57:46.471 --> 01:57:48.060
<v Speaker 2>what I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>OCD spikes where it.</v>

2502
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:53.540
<v Speaker 2>If I'm driving on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I start to imagine all the possibilities</v>

2503
01:57:53.911 --> 01:57:55.770
<v Speaker 2>that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the things that can happen with</v>

2504
01:57:55.771 --> 01:58:00.771
<v Speaker 2>all the cars and it liked those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's moments where it's so </v>

2505
01:58:00.771 --> 01:58:03.450
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming where I just can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't drive like it's too much.</v>

2506
01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:10.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like somebody's husband ends up </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving me around a lot on the freeway </v>

2507
01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:12.190
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True story and it's like,</v>

2508
01:58:12.590 --> 01:58:16.290
<v Speaker 2>so what I often do is I like to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes from where I work.</v>

2509
01:58:16.291 --> 01:58:21.291
<v Speaker 2>That way I don't ever have to get on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highway because I don't have to think </v>

2510
01:58:21.291 --> 01:58:21.291
<v Speaker 2>about all the things that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm on the highway.</v>

2511
01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2512
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you're too smart to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2513
01:58:26.821 --> 01:58:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's that I sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsess over what I can't control and the</v>

2514
01:58:31.291 --> 01:58:33.330
<v Speaker 2>fact that there's like all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

2515
01:58:33.630 --> 01:58:38.630
<v Speaker 2>they're doing all these things and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this could happen and all these </v>

2516
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:38.630
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's like,</v>

2517
01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like overload.</v>

2518
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I had a moment when my</v>

2519
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:46.980
<v Speaker 1>first daughter was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where when I was in the hospital in the,</v>

2520
01:58:47.110 --> 01:58:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the moment she came out of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like how many different </v>

2521
01:58:52.271 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 1>people are being born right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously all around the world.</v>

2522
01:58:57.250 --> 01:59:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you could see that on a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

2523
01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would look like an invasion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

2524
01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:08.371
<v Speaker 1>If you could see the millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt being born all over the world </v>

2525
01:59:08.371 --> 01:59:08.371
<v Speaker 1>at the same moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2526
01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.800
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shooting out of Vaginas,</v>

2527
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2528
01:59:12.401 --> 01:59:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2529
01:59:12.681 --> 01:59:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2530
01:59:12.971 --> 01:59:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2531
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2532
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2533
01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.190
<v Speaker 1>it would be so in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got over it,</v>

2534
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I got over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glad we have that ability to get out </v>

2535
01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:24.940
<v Speaker 1>some of that stuff because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's overwhelming.</v>

2536
01:59:24.941 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It's overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very overwhelming.</v>

2537
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2538
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:30.920
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2539
01:59:30.921 --> 01:59:35.921
<v Speaker 1>what one of the main issues with paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention too much to bad things in the </v>

2540
01:59:36.911 --> 01:59:39.280
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked about this many times,</v>

2541
01:59:39.281 --> 01:59:44.281
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>digesting 7 billion people's worth of </v>

2542
01:59:44.281 --> 01:59:49.021
<v Speaker 1>problems because anytime something </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular or horrific comes up from </v>

2543
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:54.691
<v Speaker 1>all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get it and we absorb it and it sort </v>

2544
01:59:54.691 --> 01:59:55.840
<v Speaker 1>of alters our idea of what the world is.</v>

2545
01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is a scary place and it's </v>

2546
02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:02.671
<v Speaker 1>filled with evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The really the numbers are pretty </v>

2547
02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers,</v>

2548
02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>like throughout your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you experience very little violence </v>

2549
02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>throughout your day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You experienced very little horrific </v>

2550
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

2551
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:17.251
<v Speaker 1>very rare in most parts of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you live in a terrible </v>

2552
02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:21.451
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood to experience the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that you see on your news feed or </v>

2553
02:00:21.451 --> 02:00:25.591
<v Speaker 1>your twitter feed all day everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an accurate expression because </v>

2554
02:00:25.591 --> 02:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>it's based on such an insane number that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to be correlated.</v>

2555
02:00:28.691 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be looking at a 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people number,</v>

2556
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be looking at a tribe of 150</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2557
02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what our brain that's with the </v>

2558
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar's number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2559
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

2560
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:43.711
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know what the fuck to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 7 billion people's worth of </v>

2561
02:00:43.711 --> 02:00:47.581
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we become these paranoid messes when </v>

2562
02:00:47.581 --> 02:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>we start thinking about all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit that's happening.</v>

2563
02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>But you're talking about a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet worth.</v>

2564
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally a planet worth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information now.</v>

2565
02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that's the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2566
02:00:59.361 --> 02:01:04.361
<v Speaker 1>This just freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about all the variables that </v>

2567
02:01:04.361 --> 02:01:04.361
<v Speaker 1>you can control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were not designed for that.</v>

2568
02:01:05.230 --> 02:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the epigenetics of living in this </v>

2569
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:15.301
<v Speaker 1>life will alter our genes and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression of our genes so that we can </v>

2570
02:01:15.370 --> 02:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>accept this kind of information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that we're gonna like </v>

2571
02:01:20.370 --> 02:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>will start to adapt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2572
02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2573
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shown that stress does </v>

2574
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>epigenetically changed expression of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes.</v>

2575
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>So tabloids are fucking us up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2576
02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to tabloids,</v>

2577
02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2578
02:01:33.341 --> 02:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are even just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fearmongering,</v>

2579
02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just going on at the Alex Jones website,</v>

2580
02:01:38.831 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>just paying attention to all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are doom and gloom,</v>

2581
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>new world order.</v>

2582
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're putting caskets out in the fema </v>

2583
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>camps and getting ready to mass kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2584
02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely changing the expression </v>

2585
02:01:55.650 --> 02:01:57.641
<v Speaker 1>of your genes shed stress distress is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something bad shit and it's also </v>

2586
02:01:57.641 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>shortening your telomeres don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2587
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>But I got a problem too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

2592
02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:14.180

<v Speaker 1>always hungry but I eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat so much sometimes waitresses don't</v>

2594
02:02:19.581 --> 02:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we go,</v>

2595
02:02:21.161 --> 02:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>like after shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we'll do like two or three shows</v>

2596
02:02:23.931 --> 02:02:28.931
<v Speaker 1>a night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll order two entrees and then a bunch </v>

2597
02:02:28.931 --> 02:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>of appetizers and I've had people say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too much.</v>

2598
02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like just keep it coming.</v>

2600
02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting it down.</v>

2601
02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of food.</v>

2602
02:02:37.611 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Two entrees regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two entrees.</v>

2603
02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's after having two other meals </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually.</v>

2604
02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just if I'm working out,</v>

2605
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>if I'm working out in our work at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

2606
02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>two things happened in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my appetite is just insane.</v>

2607
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pit that just can't be filled.</v>

2608
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your body needs the uh,</v>

2609
02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be like the cool older </v>

2610
02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:06.671
<v Speaker 1>mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool older monkey that's got his shit </v>

2611
02:03:06.671 --> 02:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

2612
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Take it down a notch that they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do some of these caloric restriction </v>

2613
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:12.600
<v Speaker 1>studies in humans to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2614
02:03:12.601 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>what if it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's the same and you know,</v>

2615
02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:18.320
<v Speaker 1>of course doing the longevity studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take forever.</v>

2616
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing kind of like a year </v>

2617
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.351
<v Speaker 1>long study and looking at specific end </v>
<v Speaker 1>points and they're finding some things </v>

2618
02:03:26.351 --> 02:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>are a little different actually from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

2619
02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>from the mice and monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm sure there's gotta be a </v>

2620
02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.030
<v Speaker 1>difference between monkeys and human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are pretty profound difference as</v>

2621
02:03:35.031 --> 02:03:39.410
<v Speaker 1>far as what our needs are nutritionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the,</v>

2622
02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2623
02:03:40.091 --> 02:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2624
02:03:40.771 --> 02:03:45.771
<v Speaker 1>the idea of stress because we can sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of conceptualize stress in a way that </v>

2625
02:03:45.771 --> 02:03:47.750
<v Speaker 1>they can mean they're dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate threats only.</v>

2626
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:49.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not conceptualizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2627
02:03:49.671 --> 02:03:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2628
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Asteroid hits me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2629
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>

2630
02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hurt.</v>

2631
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if my wife's cheating on me?</v>

2632
02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking about any of these </v>

2633
02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I get fired?</v>

2634
02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>They're not thinking about any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2635
02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:05.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't have anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate concerns,</v>

2636
02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what we're designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

2637
02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2638
02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the genes of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and the amount of time that we've</v>

2639
02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:19.121
<v Speaker 1>been in this particular type of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society and the amount of time that </v>

2640
02:04:19.121 --> 02:04:20.460
<v Speaker 1>we've been essentially hunter gatherers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2641
02:04:20.710 --> 02:04:25.710
<v Speaker 1>there's no comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a long stretch of time where we </v>

2642
02:04:25.710 --> 02:04:30.161
<v Speaker 1>were just living a very specific way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then over the last couple of hundred </v>

2643
02:04:30.161 --> 02:04:34.331
<v Speaker 1>years things radically shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange and new direction and </v>

2644
02:04:34.331 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 1>then we find ourselves where we are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the invention of the printing press</v>

2645
02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>to the fucking twitter feed.</v>

2646
02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three printers freaked me out,</v>

2647
02:04:41.451 --> 02:04:46.451
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are just going to start making </v>

2648
02:04:46.451 --> 02:04:46.451
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually.</v>

2649
02:04:46.451 --> 02:04:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Nasa was funding a study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to three d print,</v>

2650
02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>non living biomolecules like wood chips </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like dental enamel and I know it's </v>

2651
02:04:55.251 --> 02:04:56.990
<v Speaker 2>kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very cool.</v>

2652
02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2653
02:04:58.270 --> 02:05:01.130
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda Nasa is funding some really</v>

2654
02:05:01.131 --> 02:05:04.250
<v Speaker 2>cool stuff and other really cool study I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw recently where they took,</v>

2655
02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:09.680
<v Speaker 2>they took cancer cells and they cultured</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in space because they wanted to see</v>

2656
02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.920
<v Speaker 2>if space could epigenetically change the</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of genes and if this would </v>

2657
02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:15.410
<v Speaker 2>have any effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they found it,</v>

2658
02:05:15.411 --> 02:05:20.411
<v Speaker 2>did that gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it affect actually genes that are </v>

2659
02:05:20.411 --> 02:05:20.900
<v Speaker 2>involved in metastasis and when you kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

2660
02:05:20.901 --> 02:05:25.901
<v Speaker 2>these cells in space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it downregulates genes involved in </v>

2661
02:05:25.901 --> 02:05:26.150
<v Speaker 2>metastasis and those cancer cells become</v>
<v Speaker 2>less aggressive.</v>

2662
02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So then they took these cells and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2663
02:05:28.371 --> 02:05:31.040
<v Speaker 2>well there's a million different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be happening in space.</v>

2664
02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Is it the gravity or is it like cosmo </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise or something?</v>

2665
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:36.410
<v Speaker 2>And so they like culture them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrifuge,</v>

2666
02:05:36.411 --> 02:05:41.411
<v Speaker 2>them meaning they spin and they spun on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain rotation per minute to like </v>

2667
02:05:41.411 --> 02:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>copy or mimic this microgravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had,</v>

2668
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:47.150
<v Speaker 2>they found the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So literally like the gravity change,</v>

2669
02:05:47.151 --> 02:05:49.640
<v Speaker 2>the expression of these genes involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>in metastasis.</v>

2670
02:05:50.090 --> 02:05:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

2671
02:05:51.650 --> 02:05:56.650
<v Speaker 2>so if you have cancer or maybe go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>squarespace or the very top of a </v>

2672
02:05:58.371 --> 02:06:03.371
<v Speaker 2>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering where they're going </v>

2673
02:06:03.371 --> 02:06:03.371
<v Speaker 2>to go with that next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2674
02:06:03.371 --> 02:06:03.371
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2675
02:06:03.371 --> 02:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>well that's interesting finding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so what do we do?</v>

2676
02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to rotate for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:09.600
<v Speaker 2>if you have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2678
02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2679
02:06:10.551 --> 02:06:11.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some interesting.</v>

2680
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's also the issue where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really go to space for very </v>

2681
02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:17.620
<v Speaker 1>long anyway because if you do go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

2682
02:06:17.621 --> 02:06:22.621
<v Speaker 1>your body doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body's really not designed to be in </v>

2683
02:06:22.621 --> 02:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>a zero gravity environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a Dr Chris,</v>

2684
02:06:23.901 --> 02:06:26.440
<v Speaker 1>our commander Chris Hadfield on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2685
02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:28.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long did he go to space for?</v>

2686
02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:30.700
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six days or something crazy like that,</v>

2687
02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and he came back and he was describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrific moments where he first </v>

2688
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.080
<v Speaker 1>stepped out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2689
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pot or whatever it is that you </v>

2690
02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:45.400
<v Speaker 1>landon and was walking on the ground for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time getting nauseous and </v>

2691
02:06:45.641 --> 02:06:50.641
<v Speaker 1>throwing up and your body's just so not </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to being in gravity and standing on</v>

2692
02:06:51.161 --> 02:06:56.161
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just been floating around for so </v>

2693
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:58.780
<v Speaker 1>long that your body's just totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>baffled and he said it was horrific.</v>

2694
02:06:58.781 --> 02:07:03.781
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it had been a wonderful </v>

2695
02:07:03.781 --> 02:07:05.761
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was it like when you finally </v>

2696
02:07:05.761 --> 02:07:05.761
<v Speaker 1>touched them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground you'd been up in space for so</v>

2697
02:07:05.761 --> 02:07:05.761
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2698
02:07:05.761 --> 02:07:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it is unbelievably awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2699
02:07:08.230 --> 02:07:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

2700
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's just in chaos.</v>

2701
02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:13.090
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know what you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole time.</v>

2702
02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty crazy.</v>

2703
02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:18.560
<v Speaker 2>The body's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very crazy and it's very.</v>

2704
02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.490
<v Speaker 2>It does adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's things that are.</v>

2705
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does adapt.</v>

2706
02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It's so endlessly fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so endlessly fascinating.</v>

2707
02:07:25.901 --> 02:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>When you find out what has been learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the body,</v>

2708
02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>how many studies have been done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2709
02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:34.600
<v Speaker 1>what information is out there and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet how much we need to learn,</v>

2710
02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>how there is to know how much there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to discover.</v>

2711
02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:39.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just we're not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even close.</v>

2712
02:07:39.971 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>We're just learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>

2713
02:07:42.491 --> 02:07:44.530
<v Speaker 1>why it's so infuriating when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2714
02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.180
<v Speaker 1>vitamins don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Case closed.</v>

2715
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2716
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple.</v>

2717
02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:54.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of vitamins do work and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a lot of studies showing that they </v>

2718
02:07:54.630 --> 02:07:55.120
<v Speaker 1>work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an accident that we've isolated</v>

2719
02:07:55.121 --> 02:08:00.121
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an accident that we know that </v>

2720
02:08:00.121 --> 02:08:00.121
<v Speaker 1>vitamin B 12 gives you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are.</v>

2721
02:08:00.121 --> 02:08:03.010
<v Speaker 1>This is science that created all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all these no nonsense people.</v>

2722
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>There is a lot of fuckery when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to vitamins.</v>

2723
02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fuckery when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to nutrition,</v>

2724
02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:07.930
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2725
02:08:07.931 --> 02:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>you're always reading about some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2726
02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>false claims that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company has or that company has,</v>

2727
02:08:14.321 --> 02:08:16.140
<v Speaker 1>are these pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However though you're,</v>

2728
02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:18.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear about things all the time and it</v>

2729
02:08:18.431 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 1>comes to nutrition and supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to athletics,</v>

2730
02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>supplementation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are purported to deliver,</v>

2731
02:08:26.070 --> 02:08:28.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing muscle growth or you know,</v>

2732
02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:31.990
<v Speaker 1>they've found that a lot of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are purported to give muscle growth</v>

2733
02:08:31.991 --> 02:08:35.230
<v Speaker 1>or erection pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a perfect example.</v>

2734
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>You know what those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's a cialis and Viagra,</v>

2735
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they just sell that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sell it as some herbal supplement,</v>

2736
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but they put in pharmaceutical drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

2737
02:08:45.190 --> 02:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>they buy that shit in bulk and they sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it actually does work,</v>

2738
02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but their pharmaceutical drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the fact that the </v>

2739
02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>restrictions are so small and the band </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the punishment of doing that is so </v>

2740
02:08:58.361 --> 02:09:01.660
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a aubrey marcus in from on it who</v>

2741
02:09:01.661 --> 02:09:06.661
<v Speaker 1>was describing the whole process of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these companies gets caught </v>

2742
02:09:06.661 --> 02:09:09.070
<v Speaker 1>selling Viagra as one of these herbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual stimulants.</v>

2743
02:09:09.490 --> 02:09:11.350
<v Speaker 1>They just get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little fine.</v>

2744
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So they changed the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they open up and under a different </v>

2745
02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.751
<v Speaker 1>company and go right back at it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have the rocket dick or whatever </v>

2746
02:09:18.751 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2747
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a study that</v>

2748
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:24.770
<v Speaker 2>it came out not long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed that like 70 percent of like</v>

2749
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:28.420
<v Speaker 2>herbal supplements on the market aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't actually what you think they are.</v>

2750
02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>So in a lot of cases people are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting some other plane in there and </v>

2751
02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're getting,</v>

2752
02:09:34.210 --> 02:09:36.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Achalasia or you know,</v>

2753
02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:39.230
<v Speaker 2>and it's like some other crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's like,</v>

2754
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2755
02:09:41.490 --> 02:09:46.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opening for people to actually do </v>

2756
02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:47.050
<v Speaker 2>like some DNA barcoding where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually test,</v>

2757
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:52.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's in a supplement and start a </v>

2758
02:09:52.051 --> 02:09:52.051
<v Speaker 2>company where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2759
02:09:52.051 --> 02:09:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I've tested these supplements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually what they're saying </v>

2760
02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:55.340
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2761
02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:59.941
<v Speaker 2>because it's like you've got a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem when people are trying to buy </v>

2762
02:09:59.941 --> 02:10:03.901
<v Speaker 2>certain supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're not even getting what </v>

2763
02:10:03.901 --> 02:10:03.901
<v Speaker 2>they think their body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether or not there's any</v>

2764
02:10:03.901 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 2>science to back up with what they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're buying.</v>

2765
02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Is he doing anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the point is they should,</v>

2766
02:10:07.930 --> 02:10:09.390
<v Speaker 2>they should be getting what they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting.</v>

2767
02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's a huge issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>of homeopathic cures,</v>

2768
02:10:12.991 --> 02:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>which are mostly nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge homeopathic industry.</v>

2769
02:10:17.131 --> 02:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>There's essentially selling you sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you total bullshit.</v>

2770
02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent study on homeopathic </v>

2771
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual ingredients and some </v>

2772
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>homeopathic cures and</v>

2773
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like they're literally selling sugar </v>

2774
02:10:32.210 --> 02:10:32.210
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2775
02:10:32.210 --> 02:10:33.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2776
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:39.220
<v Speaker 4>not having certain vitamins and minerals</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fatty acids in your diet and things </v>

2777
02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:40.100
<v Speaker 4>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:42.710
<v Speaker 4>if it affects your immune system and </v>
<v Speaker 4>affects cognitive function,</v>

2779
02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:46.340
<v Speaker 4>it affects all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then taking all this other crap that</v>

2780
02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like the I the idea of some </v>

2781
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:51.590
<v Speaker 4>exotic thing isolated from somewhere and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2782
02:10:51.591 --> 02:10:54.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does this because it's exotic and you</v>

2783
02:10:54.471 --> 02:10:55.350
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality is,</v>

2784
02:10:55.351 --> 02:11:00.351
<v Speaker 4>is people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be focusing on what they're </v>

2785
02:11:00.351 --> 02:11:00.351
<v Speaker 4>not getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's essential for,</v>

2786
02:11:00.351 --> 02:11:01.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that we know that's essential for</v>

2787
02:11:01.431 --> 02:11:04.060
<v Speaker 4>the proteins in their body to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2788
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 4>and so that a lot of that homeopathic </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

2789
02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:09.350
<v Speaker 4>it gets mixed in with the vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>minerals to.</v>

2790
02:11:09.351 --> 02:11:12.050
<v Speaker 4>And that's really irritating because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really.</v>

2791
02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.420
<v Speaker 4>There are two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2792
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Nutrition and homeopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:21.800
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of nonsense if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in that.</v>

2794
02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Just Google a homeopathic medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar pills and there's all of studies,</v>

2795
02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:30.880
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of different stuff on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on sugar pills actually.</v>

2796
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:35.450
<v Speaker 4>They've shown they've done a placebo </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects studies using sugar pill pills,</v>

2797
02:11:35.970 --> 02:11:37.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they've published.</v>

2798
02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:42.520
<v Speaker 4>They've given someone a placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the whole point of the study was </v>

2799
02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.630
<v Speaker 4>not for the person conducting it to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>know who had the placebo.</v>

2800
02:11:44.631 --> 02:11:45.170
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2801
02:11:45.171 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 4>let's see if the placebo effect is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it absolutely is real.</v>

2802
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:50.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2803
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:53.900
<v Speaker 4>if they think they're getting something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will experience something,</v>

2804
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:54.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's real to them.</v>

2805
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:58.100
<v Speaker 4>And then actually they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get sick as much or they feel</v>

2806
02:11:58.101 --> 02:11:59.210
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2807
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:04.211
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely something to be said </v>

2808
02:12:04.211 --> 02:12:06.671
<v Speaker 4>for a sugar pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's part of the success of </v>

2809
02:12:06.671 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 4>things like homeopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really confusing,</v>

2810
02:12:06.921 --> 02:12:11.921
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The placebo effect is absolutely </v>

2811
02:12:11.921 --> 02:12:13.310
<v Speaker 4>fascinating that you can send the mind a</v>
<v Speaker 4>signal or,</v>

2812
02:12:13.311 --> 02:12:18.040
<v Speaker 4>or instill it in a mind by taking a pill</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the mind believes that medicine</v>

2813
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:23.050
<v Speaker 4>is there and then conducts business as </v>
<v Speaker 4>if this new found healing property </v>

2814
02:12:23.050 --> 02:12:23.050
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

2815
02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2816
02:12:23.710 --> 02:12:24.620
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is real.</v>

2817
02:12:24.621 --> 02:12:26.420
<v Speaker 4>The placebo effect is real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know why.</v>

2818
02:12:26.421 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2819
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:30.590
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really done a ton of research </v>
<v Speaker 4>and understanding why,</v>

2820
02:12:30.591 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2821
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:34.700
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting how your brain can,</v>

2822
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make your,</v>

2823
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.140
<v Speaker 4>make yourself think that something's </v>
<v Speaker 4>working and you actually can force </v>

2824
02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:41.840
<v Speaker 4>yourself to be healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2825
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 4>so it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is very,</v>

2826
02:12:45.291 --> 02:12:46.610
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very fascinating.</v>

2827
02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:47.840
<v Speaker 4>Endlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>endlessly.</v>

2828
02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:48.640
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2829
02:12:48.650 --> 02:12:53.650
<v Speaker 4>the human being is like a human body is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me essentially like the most </v>

2830
02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:58.241
<v Speaker 4>incredibly complex computer ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we don't have a guidebook for it </v>

2831
02:12:58.241 --> 02:13:02.170
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just talking about the physical </v>

2832
02:13:02.170 --> 02:13:02.210
<v Speaker 4>aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget about managing your mind,</v>

2833
02:13:03.370 --> 02:13:07.280
<v Speaker 4>your thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which also can lead to a lot of ailments</v>

2834
02:13:07.281 --> 02:13:10.330
<v Speaker 4>and incorrect thinking and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>apps.</v>

2835
02:13:10.590 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started getting,</v>

2836
02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:14.900
<v Speaker 4>when I started researching these studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the effects of,</v>

2837
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:19.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depleting trip to fan from your brain </v>

2838
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:19.990
<v Speaker 4>and how like normal people all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden become like,</v>

2839
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:21.540
<v Speaker 4>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>impulsive,</v>

2840
02:13:21.541 --> 02:13:22.250
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2841
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.890
<v Speaker 4>violence and impulsive behaviors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>recidivism.</v>

2842
02:13:24.891 --> 02:13:25.460
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2843
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:30.970
<v Speaker 4>they'll do these tests were they </v>
<v Speaker 4>punished for doing something wrong and </v>

2844
02:13:30.970 --> 02:13:33.661
<v Speaker 4>they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll keep repeating the same </v>

2845
02:13:33.661 --> 02:13:33.661
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2846
02:13:33.661 --> 02:13:33.661
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe</v>

2847
02:13:33.661 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 2>you can change someone's behavior by </v>
<v Speaker 2>depleting trip to fan.</v>

2848
02:13:35.071 --> 02:13:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really,</v>

2849
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing to me.</v>

2850
02:13:38.911 --> 02:13:43.911
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way that nutrition affects your </v>

2851
02:13:43.911 --> 02:13:46.821
<v Speaker 2>brain function in general and behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>is really interesting to me because it </v>

2852
02:13:46.821 --> 02:13:49.380
<v Speaker 2>suggests that we have to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some control over our cognitive function</v>

2853
02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:51.390
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we should be optimizing</v>

2854
02:13:51.391 --> 02:13:54.330
<v Speaker 2>that as much as we can to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2855
02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:59.540
<v Speaker 2>perform better to have better cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills and to also better society by </v>

2856
02:13:59.540 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 2>behaving better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2857
02:13:59.761 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2858
02:14:00.781 --> 02:14:05.781
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done studies with like school </v>

2859
02:14:05.781 --> 02:14:07.651
<v Speaker 2>children where they've giving them like </v>
<v Speaker 2>omega three fatty acids and </v>

2860
02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:08.150
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins and it's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2861
02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>how effected their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2862
02:14:10.021 --> 02:14:13.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq scores in some cases by like dramatic</v>

2863
02:14:13.951 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 2>effects and even affected juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 2>delinquency and juvenile.</v>

2864
02:14:16.651 --> 02:14:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's effected,</v>

2865
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:21.630
<v Speaker 2>effected juvenile delinquency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been studies showing that giving</v>

2866
02:14:21.631 --> 02:14:24.660
<v Speaker 2>these people a multivitamin and omega </v>
<v Speaker 2>three fatty acids.</v>

2867
02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:26.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to pinpoint what </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically in it,</v>

2868
02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything because these pathways are </v>

2869
02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.820
<v Speaker 2>all working together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's affecting their.</v>

2870
02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 2>What I think is happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2871
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:36.630
<v Speaker 2>it's also affecting their serotonin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>

2872
02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:37.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

2873
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>they're not as impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

2874
02:14:39.851 --> 02:14:42.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like long term thinking there.</v>

2875
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely fascinating that you can</v>

2876
02:14:45.211 --> 02:14:50.211
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through nutrition affects someone's </v>

2877
02:14:50.211 --> 02:14:52.071
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another study where they had </v>

2878
02:14:52.071 --> 02:14:54.441
<v Speaker 2>given prisoners omega three fatty acids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it affected their aggressive </v>

2879
02:14:54.931 --> 02:14:57.010
<v Speaker 2>outbursts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2880
02:14:57.590 --> 02:14:58.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's another,</v>

2881
02:14:58.520 --> 02:14:59.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2882
02:14:59.761 --> 02:15:04.761
<v Speaker 2>you've got a population of people that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>incarcerated and knows what they're </v>

2883
02:15:04.761 --> 02:15:09.660
<v Speaker 2>getting fed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably deficient in multiple </v>

2884
02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:12.411
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including omega three fatty acids and </v>

2885
02:15:12.411 --> 02:15:12.411
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin D.</v>

2886
02:15:12.411 --> 02:15:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Guy on recently is kid war machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a MMA fighter,</v>

2887
02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>John Copa neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his real name war machines,</v>

2888
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:19.320
<v Speaker 1>his fighting name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty cute,</v>

2889
02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about a year that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did in prison where they.</v>

2890
02:15:23.391 --> 02:15:28.391
<v Speaker 1>They gave him 1500 calories a day and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was horrible nutrition and just how his </v>

2891
02:15:28.391 --> 02:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>body just felt like it was wasting away </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of it.</v>

2892
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2893
02:15:30.531 --> 02:15:32.120
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see,</v>

2894
02:15:32.570 --> 02:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're spending money to keep people in </v>

2895
02:15:37.570 --> 02:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2896
02:15:37.570 --> 02:15:41.560
<v Speaker 2>why not give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give their brain the proper nutrients </v>

2897
02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.770
<v Speaker 2>they need to try to heal itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to make it work better.</v>

2898
02:15:42.771 --> 02:15:43.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2899
02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you're talking silly because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a person wants to fix </v>

2900
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:48.250
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to make money.</v>

2901
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're dealing with privatized </v>

2902
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:54.791
<v Speaker 1>prisons and you're also dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison guard unions that are trying to </v>

2903
02:15:55.671 --> 02:16:00.671
<v Speaker 1>keep people in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have prison guards that have </v>

2904
02:16:00.671 --> 02:16:00.671
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2905
02:16:00.671 --> 02:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not dealing with a whole system </v>

2906
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>where the entire system is dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually rehabilitating people.</v>

2907
02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:08.660
<v Speaker 1>That sort of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pretend it is there.</v>

2908
02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:09.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just a system.</v>

2909
02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Someone can start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that,</v>

2910
02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:14.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that donate.</v>

2911
02:16:14.121 --> 02:16:16.130
<v Speaker 2>That basically is a charity that we give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to.</v>

2912
02:16:16.131 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>These people donate money and we give </v>
<v Speaker 2>people these vitamins,</v>

2913
02:16:19.141 --> 02:16:22.040
<v Speaker 2>these Omega three and vitamin D and </v>
<v Speaker 2>multivitamins in prison.</v>

2914
02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:22.760
<v Speaker 2>People are not gonna.</v>

2915
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:24.460
<v Speaker 1>They're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2916
02:16:24.461 --> 02:16:26.740
<v Speaker 1>if you want to give people nutrients and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamins,</v>

2917
02:16:26.741 --> 02:16:31.741
<v Speaker 1>give it to poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give it to poor people that haven't </v>

2918
02:16:31.741 --> 02:16:31.741
<v Speaker 1>committed crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever</v>

2919
02:16:31.741 --> 02:16:32.170
<v Speaker 4>give it to prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't try to fix presidents.</v>

2920
02:16:32.171 --> 02:16:34.930
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see your point of view,</v>

2921
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see how people are going to say,</v>

2922
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:41.911
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to start somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't start with people that have </v>

2923
02:16:41.911 --> 02:16:41.911
<v Speaker 4>already fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should definitely start with.</v>

2924
02:16:41.911 --> 02:16:43.150
<v Speaker 4>We should definitely give him the poor </v>
<v Speaker 4>people also.</v>

2925
02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2926
02:16:44.141 --> 02:16:49.141
<v Speaker 4>we need to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these people that can't afford to </v>

2927
02:16:49.141 --> 02:16:53.370
<v Speaker 4>eat all these greens and fish every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can at least give them a fish oil </v>

2928
02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:57.961
<v Speaker 4>pill and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vitamin D pill and multivitamin to </v>

2929
02:16:57.961 --> 02:16:57.970
<v Speaker 4>help give,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give him some of those micronutrients,</v>

2930
02:16:57.971 --> 02:17:02.971
<v Speaker 4>particularly the children that are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing well and on their cognitive tests </v>

2931
02:17:02.971 --> 02:17:06.421
<v Speaker 4>and having behavioral problems and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like people don't want to ever think </v>

2932
02:17:06.421 --> 02:17:06.610
<v Speaker 4>about the fact that nutrition plays a </v>
<v Speaker 4>role in that.</v>

2933
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:11.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not just all genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not all environment and you know,</v>

2934
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:14.050
<v Speaker 4>in terms of being abused or.</v>

2935
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:17.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean that definitely plays a role for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that there is,</v>

2936
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:23.280
<v Speaker 4>there is a component of nutrition that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can control to some degree and it's </v>

2937
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:25.630
<v Speaker 4>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cheap solution.</v>

2938
02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Vitamins aren't that expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2939
02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.920
<v Speaker 4>relatively speaking you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get a Omega three pill,</v>

2940
02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:32.950
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pill,</v>

2941
02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:37.210
<v Speaker 4>multivitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not that much money a month.</v>

2942
02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Now there was something else that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that you wanted to talk about.</v>

2943
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:42.010
<v Speaker 4>The Dave asprey had said that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorrect.</v>

2944
02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:44.110
<v Speaker 4>That was the epigenetic tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2945
02:17:44.111 --> 02:17:44.420
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2946
02:17:44.421 --> 02:17:49.421
<v Speaker 4>the Swedish study I had listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast that you'd had some time ago and</v>

2947
02:17:50.410 --> 02:17:51.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got good information,</v>

2948
02:17:51.731 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just,</v>

2949
02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:57.130
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to correct that because he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that the,</v>

2950
02:17:57.410 --> 02:18:01.390
<v Speaker 4>the children from the well fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2951
02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:04.420
<v Speaker 4>the ones that were grandchildren of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>well fed children lived,</v>

2952
02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:06.530
<v Speaker 4>got type two diabetes less.</v>

2953
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.510
<v Speaker 4>That was completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2954
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:10.150
<v Speaker 4>it was the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2955
02:18:10.151 --> 02:18:13.510
<v Speaker 4>He's a collector of interesting ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2956
02:18:13.530 --> 02:18:18.530
<v Speaker 4>although I liked the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets shit wrong and I don't know if </v>

2957
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:22.561
<v Speaker 4>he's always that good about recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he has done that and correcting </v>

2958
02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:23.970
<v Speaker 4>themself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2959
02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:27.590
<v Speaker 4>we've had a real issue with him as of </v>
<v Speaker 4>lately because of microtoxins.</v>

2960
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:29.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you're aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole issue of micro topics.</v>

2961
02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:31.330
<v Speaker 4>A little bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2962
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:36.870
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not concerned about mycotoxins and </v>

2963
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:39.601
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more concerned about not getting my </v>

2964
02:18:39.601 --> 02:18:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Omega three and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>micronutrients and involved in.</v>

2965
02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:45.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean aflatoxins certainly something I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want,</v>

2966
02:18:45.881 --> 02:18:50.881
<v Speaker 4>but that's peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So mycotoxins in peanuts are a real </v>

2967
02:18:51.311 --> 02:18:52.930
<v Speaker 4>issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And corn,</v>

2968
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:54.430
<v Speaker 4>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's another real issue.</v>

2969
02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is selling coffee and now we're</v>

2970
02:18:59.771 --> 02:19:04.771
<v Speaker 4>selling this coffee through on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was supposed to be the cure to this</v>

2971
02:19:05.141 --> 02:19:07.270
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this the coffee microtoxins?</v>

2972
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:12.271
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually drinking Hawaiian Kona </v>

2973
02:19:12.271 --> 02:19:15.241
<v Speaker 4>coffee that I started drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started drinking right after we got </v>

2974
02:19:15.241 --> 02:19:17.560
<v Speaker 4>our results back on the mycotoxins </v>
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>

2975
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 4>So his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His contention was that 70 plus percent,</v>

2976
02:19:21.881 --> 02:19:26.881
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was of all coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is infected with mycotoxins and they </v>

2977
02:19:26.881 --> 02:19:27.520
<v Speaker 4>make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That make the coffee tastes bitter.</v>

2978
02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:28.150
<v Speaker 4>They make it tastes</v>

2979
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:33.180
<v Speaker 1>bad and then make you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took too much of this at face value </v>

2980
02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:36.761
<v Speaker 1>and parotid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that he said and </v>

2981
02:19:36.761 --> 02:19:36.770
<v Speaker 1>then we decided to start looking into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

2982
02:19:36.771 --> 02:19:41.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've known about mycotoxins and </v>

2983
02:19:41.771 --> 02:19:44.381
<v Speaker 1>coffee for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pub med study from 1980 about </v>

2984
02:19:44.381 --> 02:19:44.870
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins and coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been an issue,</v>

2985
02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.640
<v Speaker 1>but they've been able to resolve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with wet processing,</v>

2986
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:50.180
<v Speaker 1>wet processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

2987
02:19:50.181 --> 02:19:55.181
<v Speaker 1>They know how good coffee providers know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to eliminate this from coughing.</v>

2988
02:19:55.940 --> 02:20:00.830
<v Speaker 1>We tested for random coffees to random </v>
<v Speaker 1>one starbucks,</v>

2989
02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:05.120
<v Speaker 1>one random bag from whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one coffee that we sell,</v>

2990
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:08.180
<v Speaker 1>which is the upgraded coffee that Dave </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces,</v>

2991
02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:10.520
<v Speaker 1>which is good coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good single source coffee,</v>

2992
02:20:10.521 --> 02:20:15.521
<v Speaker 1>and another one called caveman coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them tested positive for </v>

2993
02:20:15.521 --> 02:20:18.791
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins and so we'll have 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all co coffee as mycotoxins and we </v>

2994
02:20:18.791 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 1>had three bags other than the upgraded </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

2995
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 1>None of them are taking is upgraded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote bulletproof process,</v>

2996
02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>which you won't resolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2997
02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:30.500
<v Speaker 1>he won't reveal what this process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>

2998
02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I kind of feel like it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some bullshit there for sure.</v>

2999
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we're going to find four </v>

3000
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:44.420
<v Speaker 1>bags of coffee and test them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our friend Tate,</v>

3001
02:20:44.421 --> 02:20:49.421
<v Speaker 1>who runs bulletproof coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tested two bags and his coffee and </v>

3002
02:20:49.701 --> 02:20:54.701
<v Speaker 1>this upgraded coffee and allegedly he </v>
<v Speaker 1>found below threshold levels of </v>

3003
02:20:54.701 --> 02:20:58.220
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins in Dave's coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't know.</v>

3004
02:20:58.310 --> 02:21:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't conduct that test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a part of that test.</v>

3005
02:21:00.651 --> 02:21:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck,</v>

3006
02:21:03.650 --> 02:21:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like when you're a guy who's</v>

3007
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:13.270
<v Speaker 1>running on and doing these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and spewing out all these </v>

3008
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:15.170
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really fucking careful.</v>

3009
02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be really fucking careful to</v>

3010
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:18.290
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is true.</v>

3011
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And if what you're saying turns out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be accurate and I find out that </v>

3012
02:21:23.290 --> 02:21:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you're profiting from what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3013
02:21:24.890 --> 02:21:27.500
<v Speaker 1>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes bad.</v>

3014
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

3015
02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's where we are with this upgraded </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee thing.</v>

3016
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still sell it at,</v>

3017
02:21:34.431 --> 02:21:39.080
<v Speaker 1>on it because it is really good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've removed all of our,</v>

3018
02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:41.870
<v Speaker 1>all the literature on the mycotoxin </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

3019
02:21:41.871 --> 02:21:45.200
<v Speaker 1>all of the literature on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you talk to the people that</v>

3020
02:21:45.201 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>are in the know in the coffee industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee growers,</v>

3021
02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:53.560
<v Speaker 1>people who grade coffee and rate coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually have a rating system that </v>

3022
02:21:53.931 --> 02:21:54.920
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3023
02:21:54.921 --> 02:21:57.950
<v Speaker 1>like you'd get a 94 and 95 and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent coffee.</v>

3024
02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your coffee loses points of a test </v>

3025
02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:03.100
<v Speaker 1>positive for mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They test it,</v>

3026
02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's,</v>

3027
02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.320
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of created this issue and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3028
02:22:06.321 --> 02:22:11.321
<v Speaker 1>and made this issue out to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why you have bitter </v>

3029
02:22:11.321 --> 02:22:11.321
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

3030
02:22:11.321 --> 02:22:11.321
<v Speaker 1>It's a mycotoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3031
02:22:11.321 --> 02:22:12.500
<v Speaker 1>no it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking burnt coffee,</v>

3032
02:22:12.501 --> 02:22:14.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are better.</v>

3033
02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3034
02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave it on the pot and then he </v>

3035
02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 1>stays heated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>

3036
02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 1>it gets bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3037
02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:20.540
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've known that for years.</v>

3038
02:22:20.541 --> 02:22:25.541
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no studies out there that show </v>

3039
02:22:25.541 --> 02:22:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that coffee with mycotoxins in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Test bidder and you also like this shit </v>

3040
02:22:28.210 --> 02:22:32.631
<v Speaker 1>of him saying that all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffees have tested positive for </v>

3041
02:22:32.631 --> 02:22:32.631
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no tests.</v>

3042
02:22:32.631 --> 02:22:37.490
<v Speaker 1>He's got no results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just go around saying </v>

3043
02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:37.830
<v Speaker 1>that without producing the data </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>

3044
02:22:37.831 --> 02:22:39.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to have to.</v>

3045
02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3046
02:22:42.781 --> 02:22:43.620
<v Speaker 1>I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3047
02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:45.430
<v Speaker 1>aflatoxins one thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3048
02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:47.880
<v Speaker 1>that certainly can cause cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3049
02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I've never really been that concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about mycotoxins in my coffee being a </v>

3050
02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:58.041
<v Speaker 1>carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more concerned about my own </v>

3051
02:22:58.041 --> 02:22:59.130
<v Speaker 1>metabolism generating reactive oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>species because that's generating more,</v>

3052
02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive oxygen species.</v>

3053
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Then in some micro toxins in coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3054
02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:05.970
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3055
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:07.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins,</v>

3056
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.240
<v Speaker 1>most certainly existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They existed.</v>

3057
02:23:09.241 --> 02:23:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Human breast milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about that?</v>

3058
02:23:11.470 --> 02:23:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've gotten mycotoxin loopy after</v>

3059
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:20.931
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to read the different </v>

3060
02:23:20.931 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 1>areas where mycotoxins have been found </v>
<v Speaker 1>or aspects of mycotoxins that can affect</v>

3061
02:23:23.731 --> 02:23:25.770
<v Speaker 1>human health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the coffee one,</v>

3062
02:23:25.771 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 1>they seem to have licked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know what the fuck it is,</v>

3063
02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:30.560
<v Speaker 1>they know what causes it and they know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with it.</v>

3064
02:23:30.561 --> 02:23:35.561
<v Speaker 1>It's called wet processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know how to not store beans where </v>

3065
02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:35.561
<v Speaker 1>they can get moldy.</v>

3066
02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 1>They know how to prevent these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from happening.</v>

3067
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:39.570
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have incentive to do that.</v>

3068
02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.570
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3069
02:23:42.610 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>he used my platform in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think is totally ethical and you </v>

3070
02:23:47.991 --> 02:23:52.991
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he claims that he's telling the truth </v>

3071
02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:52.991
<v Speaker 1>and he claims that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3072
02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.290
<v Speaker 1>if you sign a nondisclosure agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll show you always,</v>

3073
02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all his testing methods like.</v>

3074
02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:58.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be bullshit.</v>

3075
02:23:58.951 --> 02:24:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And I feel bad because I liked the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>

3076
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:04.220
<v Speaker 1>first of all he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3077
02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>he's a collector of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a formal education in </v>

3078
02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:09.330
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in nutrition.</v>

3079
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:12.990
<v Speaker 1>This is not something that he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phd and he's not,</v>

3080
02:24:12.991 --> 02:24:14.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is what I'm saying.</v>

3081
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3082
02:24:15.961 --> 02:24:20.961
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to you about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it from someone who went to </v>

3083
02:24:20.961 --> 02:24:24.171
<v Speaker 1>really good schools and you do research </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for a fucking living with </v>

3084
02:24:24.171 --> 02:24:24.171
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>

3085
02:24:24.171 --> 02:24:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3086
02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:25.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I said,</v>

3087
02:24:25.861 --> 02:24:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert in microtoxin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've sort of not really been worried</v>

3088
02:24:30.211 --> 02:24:35.211
<v Speaker 1>about it and coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just based on the little bit of reading </v>

3089
02:24:35.211 --> 02:24:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

3090
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it can be an issue if you </v>

3091
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>have mycotoxin infested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infected coffee.</v>

3092
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:41.210
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it does take,</v>

3093
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:42.930
<v Speaker 1>it's really infected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking like,</v>

3094
02:24:42.931 --> 02:24:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's like,</v>

3095
02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:46.130
<v Speaker 1>if there's a trace amount of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3096
02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

3097
02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's what we found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not what we found.</v>

3098
02:24:50.970 --> 02:24:53.100
<v Speaker 1>What we found is the zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what tate,</v>

3099
02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:58.101
<v Speaker 1>my friend tate and caveman coffee found </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his is below threshold levels of two </v>

3100
02:24:58.101 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 1>different types of mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is not gonna Affect you at all?</v>

3101
02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3102
02:25:01.141 --> 02:25:06.141
<v Speaker 1>they say that anything that's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the expression of genes that </v>

3103
02:25:06.141 --> 02:25:09.291
<v Speaker 1>are involved in stress resistance can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little bit of a hormetic effect </v>

3104
02:25:09.291 --> 02:25:09.291
<v Speaker 1>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3105
02:25:09.291 --> 02:25:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3106
02:25:09.811 --> 02:25:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the other thing was that the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of roasting the beans destroys a</v>

3107
02:25:14.551 --> 02:25:18.010
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of the microtoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge amount of the mold gets.</v>

3108
02:25:18.011 --> 02:25:23.011
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets killed 70 to 80 percent in some </v>

3109
02:25:23.011 --> 02:25:23.011
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reminds me,</v>

3110
02:25:23.011 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole linkedin thing</v>

3111
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.900
<v Speaker 2>is another thing when you're saying he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3112
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:28.120
<v Speaker 2>that someone destroys the roasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

3113
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:29.830
<v Speaker 2>destroys the microtoxin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3114
02:25:30.250 --> 02:25:31.720
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing with lectins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

3115
02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:32.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3116
02:25:33.810 --> 02:25:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3117
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:37.120
<v Speaker 2>who started this linkedin thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe Mercola,</v>

3118
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Mark Macola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he,</v>

3119
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>he talks about it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3120
02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:42.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

3121
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:47.880
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't eat beans because beans have </v>

3122
02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.010
<v Speaker 2>lectins and lectins cause an immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>response in your gut.</v>

3123
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:51.460
<v Speaker 2>And this is going to cause leaky gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the whole story.</v>

3124
02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:52.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more complicated.</v>

3125
02:25:52.871 --> 02:25:55.330
<v Speaker 2>For one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lectins are activated by heat.</v>

3126
02:25:55.331 --> 02:25:58.540
<v Speaker 2>And so unless you're chewing raw kidney </v>
<v Speaker 2>beans or lentils,</v>

3127
02:25:58.541 --> 02:26:02.170
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not activating an immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>response in your gut.</v>

3128
02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:07.171
<v Speaker 2>And actually beans are really high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiber and fiber gets broken down into </v>

3129
02:26:07.171 --> 02:26:11.911
<v Speaker 2>short chain fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually prevents the immune </v>

3130
02:26:11.911 --> 02:26:12.430
<v Speaker 2>response in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually doing the opposite.</v>

3131
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3132
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:15.490
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people,</v>

3133
02:26:15.491 --> 02:26:18.560
<v Speaker 2>some people have good information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also have some bad information.</v>

3134
02:26:18.561 --> 02:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

3135
02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:23.500
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anyone that's offering you like a</v>

3136
02:26:23.501 --> 02:26:24.660
<v Speaker 2>magic bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>

3137
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.260
<v Speaker 2>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the cure.</v>

3138
02:26:26.261 --> 02:26:28.330
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3139
02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:30.430
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated and they're straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3140
02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And I should be clear when I say that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>roasting,</v>

3141
02:26:33.741 --> 02:26:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the roasting process supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminates mycotoxins.</v>

3142
02:26:36.921 --> 02:26:40.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just destroys the mold that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mycotoxins,</v>

3143
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:42.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the source upstream of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:26:42.890 --> 02:26:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You're roasting doesn't actually destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins,</v>

3145
02:26:45.231 --> 02:26:50.231
<v Speaker 1>but it does destroy the mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 70 to 80 percent of it in some </v>

3146
02:26:50.231 --> 02:26:51.080
<v Speaker 1>cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's another one of those cases where</v>

3147
02:26:51.081 --> 02:26:52.910
<v Speaker 1>there's too much to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much to learn.</v>

3148
02:26:52.911 --> 02:26:57.911
<v Speaker 1>And I have a guy on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says he's an expert in some of the </v>

3149
02:26:57.911 --> 02:27:00.551
<v Speaker 1>things that he says seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and that's the big one that </v>

3150
02:27:00.551 --> 02:27:01.790
<v Speaker 1>everyone has mold in their coffee except</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3151
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I know how my super secret way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of him,</v>

3152
02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but I fucking bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we have a problem that uh,</v>

3153
02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:11.270
<v Speaker 1>we've allowed to be created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

3154
02:27:11.271 --> 02:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not drinking anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3155
02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:17.700
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just at a general principle will </v>

3156
02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:17.990
<v Speaker 1>probably eventually stop selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is good coffee.</v>

3157
02:27:17.991 --> 02:27:19.340
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Single source coffee.</v>

3158
02:27:19.341 --> 02:27:21.920
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for me.</v>

3159
02:27:21.921 --> 02:27:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the coffee from Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Kona coffee.</v>

3160
02:27:24.651 --> 02:27:27.350
<v Speaker 1>It has a really great taste to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just started drinking that.</v>

3161
02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Upgraded coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3162
02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3163
02:27:30.411 --> 02:27:35.411
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would buy it based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this premise that has not been proven </v>

3164
02:27:35.411 --> 02:27:37.820
<v Speaker 1>that most coffee has mold in it with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking evidence whatsoever to back that</v>

3165
02:27:37.821 --> 02:27:38.060
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3166
02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any evidence that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee has microtoxin and I haven't seen</v>

3167
02:27:42.690 --> 02:27:46.480
<v Speaker 2>evidence that it has levels of micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxins that are harmful.</v>

3168
02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:49.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3169
02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:53.290
<v Speaker 1>there was one test that showed that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bitterness area,</v>

3170
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:55.600
<v Speaker 1>there was one test that showed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mice,</v>

3171
02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:58.780
<v Speaker 1>when they were given saccharin infused </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Mycotoxins,</v>

3172
02:27:58.810 --> 02:28:01.720
<v Speaker 1>tended to avoid that Saccharin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3173
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:02.930
<v Speaker 1>with microtoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3174
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but saccharin sweet thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3175
02:28:05.651 --> 02:28:10.651
<v Speaker 1>it's a sweet product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I who knows why they're avoiding the </v>

3176
02:28:10.901 --> 02:28:15.901
<v Speaker 1>taste of the Mycotoxins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows if their bodies have figured </v>

3177
02:28:15.901 --> 02:28:16.080
<v Speaker 1>out that it's fucking poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3178
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but running around saying that the </v>

3179
02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:23.120
<v Speaker 1>reason why coffee is bitter is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just stating it as fact.</v>

3180
02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Tenants the same thing that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canon.</v>

3181
02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3182
02:28:27.130 --> 02:28:30.130
<v Speaker 1>that's why that's the bitter part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffee and,</v>

3183
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:32.530
<v Speaker 1>but he causes that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3184
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:33.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're naturally in,</v>

3185
02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:37.070
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the plants and it gets burned.</v>

3186
02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That burnt taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3187
02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That burnt taste hasn't been done </v>

3188
02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:46.271
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Research to know what the he does to </v>

3189
02:28:46.271 --> 02:28:46.271
<v Speaker 1>that process.</v>

3190
02:28:46.271 --> 02:28:46.271
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3191
02:28:46.271 --> 02:28:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what they say mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coffee experts say when I fucking </v>

3192
02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:54.491
<v Speaker 1>read more about coffee over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks than I've ever wanted to </v>

3193
02:28:54.491 --> 02:28:55.620
<v Speaker 1>read or thought I would ever have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3194
02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:01.000
<v Speaker 1>but coffee experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where it gets pretty clear all </v>

3195
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.140
<v Speaker 1>call bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them call bullshit.</v>

3196
02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:08.141
<v Speaker 1>And what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all clapped bullshit across the </v>

3197
02:29:08.141 --> 02:29:08.141
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just coffee providers,</v>

3198
02:29:08.141 --> 02:29:09.800
<v Speaker 1>not just coffee growers with coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasters,</v>

3199
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:13.580
<v Speaker 1>coffee experts across the board think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what he's saying is horseshit.</v>

3200
02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:19.300
<v Speaker 1>That's usually a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one guy who's not even a fucking </v>

3201
02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>nutrition expert and he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a phd in nutrition.</v>

3202
02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.560
<v Speaker 1>He comes along with these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims and also has this incredible </v>

3203
02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 1>method to alleviate this ailment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3204
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:31.130
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those classic examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3205
02:29:31.131 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 1>create a problem and then offer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution profit,</v>

3206
02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3207
02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3208
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be what's been done here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's intentional or not,</v>

3209
02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it was intentional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that he's one of those guys </v>

3210
02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:48.731
<v Speaker 1>that once he goes down a path to say he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong or two to try to win some </v>

3211
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:54.670
<v Speaker 1>other product on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to then say you were wrong </v>

3212
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>situation where it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3213
02:29:55.800 --> 02:29:58.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky because it's not bad coffee.</v>

3214
02:29:58.461 --> 02:30:00.320
<v Speaker 1>It's good coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good.</v>

3215
02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3216
02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:03.620
<v Speaker 1>from our testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mycotoxin free.</v>

3217
02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:06.830
<v Speaker 1>It's single source coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he just sold it as that,</v>

3218
02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:09.170
<v Speaker 1>it would be a really good product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

3219
02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:14.480
<v Speaker 1>The other thing about coffee experts is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to know when it was,</v>

3220
02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:16.490
<v Speaker 1>when it was roasted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to know.</v>

3221
02:30:16.491 --> 02:30:20.390
<v Speaker 1>They want to know like it's like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time between when the coffee's roasted</v>

3222
02:30:20.391 --> 02:30:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and how long you should keep it while </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still fresh.</v>

3223
02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The he doesn't offer that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any of that.</v>

3224
02:30:25.671 --> 02:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>So they're calling bullshit on that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3225
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:32.550
<v Speaker 1>If you really cared about coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would let let us know when it's </v>

3226
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:35.141
<v Speaker 1>roasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should have an on a roasted by date or </v>

3227
02:30:35.141 --> 02:30:35.141
<v Speaker 1>roasted on date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3228
02:30:35.141 --> 02:30:35.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3229
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it's pretty fricking </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

3230
02:30:38.660 --> 02:30:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have children and jobs and things to </v>

3231
02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:47.561
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to deal with this </v>

3232
02:30:47.561 --> 02:30:47.561
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've,</v>

3233
02:30:47.561 --> 02:30:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am obligated now because I got thrust </v>

3234
02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.510
<v Speaker 1>into this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to talk to someone like you to</v>

3235
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:58.750
<v Speaker 1>clear up some of the misconceptions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and nutrition and to find out </v>

3236
02:30:58.750 --> 02:31:01.100
<v Speaker 1>what's real and what's not and what what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are issues.</v>

3237
02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to a guy like Brian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dunning was like,</v>

3238
02:31:03.291 --> 02:31:05.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't need vitamin C.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need this.</v>

3239
02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:07.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't need that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at him.</v>

3240
02:31:07.221 --> 02:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking totally shaped as fat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not taking care of his body.</v>

3241
02:31:11.921 --> 02:31:16.050
<v Speaker 1>He's a no nonsense guy who got fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a kid and he was raised a</v>

3242
02:31:16.051 --> 02:31:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Mormon and now he's trying to counteract</v>
<v Speaker 1>that by being a skeptic I.</v>

3243
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that's really essentially what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3244
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 1>but that guy can fuck with people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>heads because he's not an expert.</v>

3245
02:31:24.930 --> 02:31:28.290
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly not an expert in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3246
02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:33.340
<v Speaker 2>so he really shouldn't be reviewing </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific literature in my opinion,</v>

3247
02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:37.250
<v Speaker 2>like he needs to get some people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really know how to do that.</v>

3248
02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:40.460
<v Speaker 2>If he's going to start trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>critically analyze science.</v>

3249
02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:45.820
<v Speaker 2>That's my opinion because I've read some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his stuff where he's trying to </v>

3250
02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:45.820
<v Speaker 2>critically analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

3251
02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:47.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3252
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:52.030
<v Speaker 2>this linus pauling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got something on his website </v>

3253
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:54.281
<v Speaker 2>talking about how a vitamin C can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has no effect on cancer incidents or can</v>

3254
02:31:56.900 --> 02:31:58.820
<v Speaker 2>help if you already have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can help,</v>

3255
02:31:58.970 --> 02:32:00.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill the cancer cells.</v>

3256
02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:05.560
<v Speaker 2>And He puts up these studies by the Mayo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinic that couldn't repeat these early </v>

3257
02:32:05.901 --> 02:32:09.590
<v Speaker 2>studies that were done by Linus Pauling </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cameron,</v>

3258
02:32:09.591 --> 02:32:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his name anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the late seventies,</v>

3259
02:32:12.771 --> 02:32:17.771
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone that's scientists will look at </v>

3260
02:32:17.771 --> 02:32:17.771
<v Speaker 2>that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3261
02:32:17.771 --> 02:32:20.930
<v Speaker 2>pauling and cameron gave their patients </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are cancer patients,</v>

3262
02:32:20.931 --> 02:32:25.931
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did that for a reason because </v>

3263
02:32:25.931 --> 02:32:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you can only orally absorbed so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C and we'll get into your </v>

3264
02:32:30.130 --> 02:32:30.130
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream.</v>

3265
02:32:30.130 --> 02:32:30.580
<v Speaker 2>But intravenously you can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3266
02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:33.710
<v Speaker 2>raise it to like millimolar </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrations.</v>

3267
02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:35.170
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3268
02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:40.420
<v Speaker 2>the two mio clinic studies that repeated</v>
<v Speaker 2>it repeated it in quotations gave him </v>

3269
02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:41.510
<v Speaker 2>orally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3270
02:32:41.511 --> 02:32:42.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

3271
02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:47.740
<v Speaker 2>you can't repeat a study and change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>method of administration from oral to </v>

3272
02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:49.640
<v Speaker 2>intravenous and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3273
02:32:49.641 --> 02:32:51.140
<v Speaker 2>we repeated the study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>

3274
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:54.230
<v Speaker 2>So when your credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're critically analyzing data,</v>

3275
02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:57.170
<v Speaker 2>you need to focus on those sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>details because they are actually really</v>

3276
02:32:57.171 --> 02:33:02.171
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a recent study just came out like </v>

3277
02:33:02.171 --> 02:33:04.781
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago where they took patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female patients,</v>

3278
02:33:05.061 --> 02:33:10.061
<v Speaker 2>I had ovarian cancer and they gave them </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C intravenously and they're </v>

3279
02:33:10.061 --> 02:33:12.650
<v Speaker 2>doing their standard chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard nowadays to do any sort</v>

3280
02:33:12.651 --> 02:33:13.120
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3281
02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:17.030
<v Speaker 2>unconventional cancer treatment that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3282
02:33:17.031 --> 02:33:18.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like you don't want to just</v>

3283
02:33:19.310 --> 02:33:20.240
<v Speaker 2>kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3284
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:21.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

3285
02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it with the chemotherapy and it</v>

3286
02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:28.661
<v Speaker 2>actually killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed the cancer cells better and </v>

3287
02:33:28.661 --> 02:33:30.410
<v Speaker 2>it also alleviated a lot of the negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms associated with the chemo.</v>

3288
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:33.410
<v Speaker 2>And this was to study published in </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

3289
02:33:33.411 --> 02:33:38.411
<v Speaker 2>translational medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a pretty good journal for </v>

3290
02:33:38.411 --> 02:33:38.411
<v Speaker 2>translational research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact.</v>

3291
02:33:38.411 --> 02:33:38.411
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3292
02:33:38.411 --> 02:33:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian has several problems with some of </v>

3293
02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the things he puts out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3294
02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:47.590
<v Speaker 1>he's accused me of being a pseudoscience</v>
<v Speaker 1>shill and even after the podcast,</v>

3295
02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:52.620
<v Speaker 1>even after the podcast where he came on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had all these really ridiculous </v>

3296
02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:57.280
<v Speaker 1>accusations that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he threw at me,</v>

3297
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his website.</v>

3298
02:33:58.841 --> 02:34:03.841
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about them one by one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I believed and what I actually </v>

3299
02:34:03.841 --> 02:34:03.841
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I said and what I didn't say,</v>

3300
02:34:03.970 --> 02:34:07.180
<v Speaker 1>and he ran after basically just</v>

3301
02:34:08.610 --> 02:34:12.480
<v Speaker 1>tapping them out mentally for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours just over and over and over again.</v>

3302
02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:14.040
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong there.</v>

3303
02:34:14.041 --> 02:34:15.570
<v Speaker 1>This is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is dumb.</v>

3304
02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:20.720
<v Speaker 1>This is poor thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went and wrote this really distorted </v>

3305
02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:21.550
<v Speaker 1>thing on his website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really bizarre account.</v>

3306
02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very kind to me,</v>

3307
02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.490
<v Speaker 1>said he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nice and funny,</v>

3308
02:34:24.491 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

3309
02:34:25.601 --> 02:34:30.601
<v Speaker 1>I still promote dangerous pseudoscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the videos that that </v>

3310
02:34:30.601 --> 02:34:35.521
<v Speaker 1>guy puts out himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this video on fracking and how </v>

3311
02:34:35.521 --> 02:34:39.160
<v Speaker 1>safe fracking is and how not no need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about fracking.</v>

3312
02:34:39.161 --> 02:34:44.161
<v Speaker 1>And he's got this really hilarious smug </v>
<v Speaker 1>video on the reality of fracking or </v>

3313
02:34:44.711 --> 02:34:49.711
<v Speaker 1>hydraulic fracturing or fracking fucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>up environments permanently.</v>

3314
02:34:50.111 --> 02:34:55.111
<v Speaker 1>All threads with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been over a thousand instances of </v>

3315
02:34:55.111 --> 02:34:57.400
<v Speaker 1>poison wells in this country because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fracking documented,</v>

3316
02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:00.640
<v Speaker 1>documented instances of poisoned wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3317
02:35:00.641 --> 02:35:05.641
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up huge parts of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country pretty much forever because of </v>

3318
02:35:05.641 --> 02:35:07.540
<v Speaker 1>fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is fracking day like?</v>

3319
02:35:07.541 --> 02:35:08.490
<v Speaker 1>How do they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3320
02:35:08.491 --> 02:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complicated process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a,</v>

3321
02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:15.840
<v Speaker 1>getting this stuff out of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting oil and natural gas out of the </v>

3322
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:16.720
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly oil right?</v>

3323
02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And it involves water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydraulic fracturing,</v>

3324
02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:25.290
<v Speaker 1>and they pump water in and I'm not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to be describing is this his thing </v>

3325
02:35:25.290 --> 02:35:25.810
<v Speaker 1>on fracking here?</v>

3326
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:31.750
<v Speaker 6>Why Marvel and Fox blamed the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 6>fracking was used in the area and </v>

3327
02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.510
<v Speaker 6>investigation into this family.</v>

3328
02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.870
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your music makes me want to kill babies.</v>

3329
02:35:35.930 --> 02:35:40.930
<v Speaker 6>Discovered that their wells had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>drilled directly into a shallow natural </v>

3330
02:35:40.930 --> 02:35:41.890
<v Speaker 6>gas deposit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is common.</v>

3331
02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:44.290
<v Speaker 6>It's not a problem with the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Properly vented.</v>

3332
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:47.650
<v Speaker 6>There's wasn't so gas got into their </v>
<v Speaker 6>water.</v>

3333
02:35:48.970 --> 02:35:51.130
<v Speaker 6>How do we know it had nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 6>fracking?</v>

3334
02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:56.490
<v Speaker 6>Water wells range in depth from a few </v>
<v Speaker 6>meters to a few hundred at the very </v>

3335
02:35:56.490 --> 02:36:00.511
<v Speaker 6>deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but fracking takes place kilometers </v>

3336
02:36:00.511 --> 02:36:02.410
<v Speaker 6>deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Past numerous layers of bedrock years of</v>

3337
02:36:02.411 --> 02:36:05.170
<v Speaker 6>study have proven what geologists have </v>
<v Speaker 6>always known.</v>

3338
02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:10.560
<v Speaker 6>There's just too much distance of solid </v>
<v Speaker 6>rock between the two regions for any </v>

3339
02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:11.350
<v Speaker 6>seat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just to take place.</v>

3340
02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Stopped at this camera right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such total horse shit.</v>

3341
02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:19.660
<v Speaker 1>He's just parroting the words of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have been paid by these </v>

3342
02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:23.120
<v Speaker 1>companies that are making fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of dollars to say.</v>

3343
02:36:23.121 --> 02:36:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

3344
02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:26.600
<v Speaker 1>these piss-poor studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3345
02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:31.860
<v Speaker 1>these people that have been documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>on all these various documentaries like </v>

3346
02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:31.860
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3347
02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:34.820
<v Speaker 1>there's the two ones on the gas land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and gas land too,</v>

3348
02:36:34.821 --> 02:36:38.480
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done interviews and showing how they can</v>

3349
02:36:38.481 --> 02:36:41.760
<v Speaker 1>light their fucking water on fire now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and showing how their,</v>

3350
02:36:41.761 --> 02:36:45.470
<v Speaker 1>their wells are poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who have been really made deathly</v>

3351
02:36:45.471 --> 02:36:48.230
<v Speaker 1>ill by drinking what they thought was </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtered water,</v>

3352
02:36:48.231 --> 02:36:53.231
<v Speaker 1>but it's not filtered enough because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the chemicals from fracking got </v>

3353
02:36:53.231 --> 02:36:56.861
<v Speaker 1>into the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proven that those are the specific </v>

3354
02:36:56.861 --> 02:36:58.910
<v Speaker 1>chemicals that are in their water that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got there from fracking and this is.</v>

3355
02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:02.000
<v Speaker 1>He's just one of those fucking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no nonsense.</v>

3356
02:37:02.001 --> 02:37:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

3357
02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>The government says it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fine,</v>

3358
02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:08.810
<v Speaker 1>but even his tone that's such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected tone.</v>

3359
02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:12.560
<v Speaker 1>That's like a fake way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking like this,</v>

3360
02:37:12.561 --> 02:37:17.270
<v Speaker 1>like reassuring you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such nonsense fucking talk,</v>

3361
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know much about fracking but I </v>

3362
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:24.520
<v Speaker 2>can tell you just from reading his </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to criticize science,</v>

3363
02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:28.230
<v Speaker 2>he's got a very topical understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you know,</v>

3364
02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:31.810
<v Speaker 2>when I was reading some of his stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was just like,</v>

3365
02:37:31.811 --> 02:37:33.550
<v Speaker 2>this guy shouldn't be doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3366
02:37:33.551 --> 02:37:34.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

3367
02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:37.840
<v Speaker 2>very naive understanding and so if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna try to criticize,</v>

3368
02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:40.150
<v Speaker 2>criticize something and turn and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>

3369
02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:45.420
<v Speaker 2>then you really need to know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about or get some frequent </v>

3370
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:45.420
<v Speaker 2>experts that are really new.</v>

3371
02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:46.990
<v Speaker 1>He's got some real problems with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and I think he knows it.</v>

3372
02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:49.720
<v Speaker 1>He sent me an email asking me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

3373
02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:52.450
<v Speaker 1>asking me about psychedelics in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expanding.</v>

3374
02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows he's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

3375
02:37:55.050 --> 02:37:58.480
<v Speaker 1>He saw also indicted by the you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to jail?</v>

3376
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:59.220
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3377
02:37:59.221 --> 02:38:02.800
<v Speaker 1>he's involved in an Ebay scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scam them from millions of dollars.</v>

3378
02:38:03.010 --> 02:38:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to talk about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

3379
02:38:04.661 --> 02:38:06.640
<v Speaker 1>but after you talk shit about me and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck himself,</v>

3380
02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3381
02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:10.690
<v Speaker 1>he was involved in this Ebay scam where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3382
02:38:10.691 --> 02:38:12.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were cookie stuffing,</v>

3383
02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:13.620
<v Speaker 1>stuffing cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3384
02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to use an application and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3385
02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the full details of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

3386
02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:21.400
<v Speaker 1>he's in real trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you pleaded guilty and he's a felon.</v>

3387
02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:23.590
<v Speaker 2>She was asking you about psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3388
02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:24.780
<v Speaker 2>it's very</v>

3389
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wants to try to figure out </v>

3390
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's wrong with his thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3391
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that it has to do with </v>

3392
02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:34.540
<v Speaker 1>growing up Mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think that there's,</v>

3393
02:38:34.540 --> 02:38:38.640
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a small amount that it fucks </v>

3394
02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.851
<v Speaker 1>your head up when you grow up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist mindset when you were </v>

3395
02:38:41.851 --> 02:38:45.181
<v Speaker 1>told that there's a man in the sky that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Smith told his disciples about </v>

3396
02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:51.360
<v Speaker 1>and that there's golden tablets at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last work of Jesus and this guy found </v>

3397
02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:54.931
<v Speaker 1>him when he was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the shit that you have to </v>

3398
02:38:54.931 --> 02:38:55.240
<v Speaker 1>believe to be a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy bought into that hook,</v>

3399
02:38:55.241 --> 02:38:57.460
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how he grew up.</v>

3400
02:38:57.490 --> 02:39:01.180
<v Speaker 1>That's how he grew up as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he grew up as a teenager.</v>

3401
02:39:01.181 --> 02:39:03.350
<v Speaker 1>That's how we grew up as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until he refuted it and,</v>

3402
02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and your thought process.</v>

3403
02:39:05.350 --> 02:39:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Now he just doesn't believe anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3404
02:39:07.591 --> 02:39:08.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3405
02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:10.650
<v Speaker 2>everything that I was told throughout my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is wrong.</v>

3406
02:39:10.651 --> 02:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>So then everything else,</v>

3407
02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:17.520
<v Speaker 1>if you just googled dangers of fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a tremendous amount of </v>

3408
02:39:18.431 --> 02:39:21.790
<v Speaker 1>information out there about fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's bad,</v>

3409
02:39:21.791 --> 02:39:23.470
<v Speaker 1>about fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dangers.</v>

3410
02:39:23.710 --> 02:39:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And we had Peter Schiff on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

3411
02:39:26.021 --> 02:39:26.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3412
02:39:26.531 --> 02:39:28.270
<v Speaker 1>economic genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>

3413
02:39:28.570 --> 02:39:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but also owns fracking companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about it and when I </v>

3414
02:39:33.570 --> 02:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>brought it up to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't deny the dangers of it.</v>

3415
02:39:35.210 --> 02:39:36.490
<v Speaker 1>What he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3416
02:39:36.491 --> 02:39:39.340
<v Speaker 1>those people got money and they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars because of that.</v>

3417
02:39:39.570 --> 02:39:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing for them.</v>

3418
02:39:40.841 --> 02:39:45.841
<v Speaker 1>Like in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars is okay to poison </v>

3419
02:39:45.841 --> 02:39:46.390
<v Speaker 1>places forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3420
02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no fracking expert.</v>

3421
02:39:48.611 --> 02:39:53.611
<v Speaker 1>I don't claim to be a fracking expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if one fraction of what is said </v>

3422
02:39:53.611 --> 02:39:58.351
<v Speaker 1>about fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative aspects of fracking is </v>

3423
02:39:58.351 --> 02:39:58.351
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tricky thing.</v>

3424
02:39:58.351 --> 02:39:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a very tricky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3425
02:39:59.170 --> 02:40:00.940
<v Speaker 1>we could use the natural resources.</v>

3426
02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3427
02:40:01.991 --> 02:40:06.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice to not be dependent on </v>

3428
02:40:06.991 --> 02:40:06.991
<v Speaker 1>foreign oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3429
02:40:06.991 --> 02:40:08.740
<v Speaker 1>if you really are destroying thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wells,</v>

3430
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:13.770
<v Speaker 1>if that's really is documented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if really people are getting sick from </v>

3431
02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:17.731
<v Speaker 1>drinking water that's contaminated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very chemicals that they use for </v>

3432
02:40:17.731 --> 02:40:18.120
<v Speaker 1>fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3433
02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:23.180
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem like it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like that's something that </v>

3434
02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:24.780
<v Speaker 1>most people are not aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you find out who are the people</v>

3435
02:40:24.781 --> 02:40:29.781
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are funding these studies that are </v>

3436
02:40:29.781 --> 02:40:29.781
<v Speaker 1>saying it's safe and where's the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from?</v>

3437
02:40:29.781 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's coming from these oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

3438
02:40:31.351 --> 02:40:34.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is coming from these oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and the reason why these,</v>

3439
02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:39.350
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these laws are in place in the first </v>

3440
02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:41.451
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is because people have been </v>

3441
02:40:41.451 --> 02:40:41.451
<v Speaker 1>greased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of is people been paid off.</v>

3442
02:40:41.451 --> 02:40:45.411
<v Speaker 1>They understand that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to be made in this and they've </v>

3443
02:40:45.411 --> 02:40:48.021
<v Speaker 1>allowed the doors to be open for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies to come in and fuck up giant </v>

3444
02:40:48.021 --> 02:40:48.930
<v Speaker 1>parts of the country forever.</v>

3445
02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Not according to Brian Dawning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

3446
02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Hydraulic fracturing takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers into the earth.</v>

3447
02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep tight.</v>

3448
02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor bastard.</v>

3449
02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Poor bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked him.</v>

3450
02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not a bad guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3451
02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:13.600
<v Speaker 1>he said after the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he would remove me from his </v>

3452
02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:13.600
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3453
02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you've convinced me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to remove you from my last.</v>

3454
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Then from just getting crushed by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

3455
02:41:17.751 --> 02:41:22.751
<v Speaker 1>the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor guy got destroyed on twitter </v>

3456
02:41:22.751 --> 02:41:25.990
<v Speaker 1>because people listened to the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so frustrated by him and the </v>

3457
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.990
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous way he thinks and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous things that he was saying.</v>

3458
02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the same pod.</v>

3459
02:41:28.370 --> 02:41:30.240
<v Speaker 2>It must have been the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had only been online.</v>

3460
02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3461
02:41:30.940 --> 02:41:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That was so infuriating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3462
02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3463
02:41:35.810 --> 02:41:36.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3464
02:41:36.431 --> 02:41:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen all your podcasts,</v>

3465
02:41:38.361 --> 02:41:43.361
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't seem to be a promoter of </v>

3466
02:41:43.361 --> 02:41:46.670
<v Speaker 2>pseudoscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem to be an inquisitive person </v>

3467
02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:49.481
<v Speaker 2>that likes to critically think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and you're also very open minded.</v>

3468
02:41:49.671 --> 02:41:50.570
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3469
02:41:50.571 --> 02:41:51.650
<v Speaker 2>what if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3470
02:41:51.651 --> 02:41:56.651
<v Speaker 2>let's think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's think about how this could be </v>

3471
02:41:56.651 --> 02:41:56.651
<v Speaker 2>working in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it is true?</v>

3472
02:41:56.651 --> 02:41:56.651
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3473
02:41:56.651 --> 02:42:01.170
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between thinking </v>

3474
02:42:01.170 --> 02:42:02.681
<v Speaker 2>like that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pseudoscience where you're just </v>

3475
02:42:02.681 --> 02:42:02.681
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3476
02:42:02.681 --> 02:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>you're just crazy and like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

3477
02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the.</v>

3478
02:42:06.350 --> 02:42:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can see the reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3479
02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:13.660
<v Speaker 2>the differentiate between someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just inquisitive and open </v>

3480
02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:16.380
<v Speaker 2>minded and doesn't see things as okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either this or that and you know,</v>

3481
02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:18.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's something that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and you know what,</v>

3482
02:42:18.891 --> 02:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot that we don't understand.</v>

3483
02:42:20.450 --> 02:42:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Like it's even even for just back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition,</v>

3484
02:42:25.041 --> 02:42:26.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like taking,</v>

3485
02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:29.750
<v Speaker 2>eating a plate full of green vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we think we're getting vitaminK and</v>

3486
02:42:29.751 --> 02:42:34.751
<v Speaker 2>folic acid and magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a whole bunch of crap in </v>

3487
02:42:34.751 --> 02:42:34.751
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what it's doing.</v>

3488
02:42:34.751 --> 02:42:36.680
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what's in there and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doing and how it's affecting,</v>

3489
02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3490
02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:43.330
<v Speaker 2>processes in our body and we do know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's good stuff going on in </v>

3491
02:42:43.330 --> 02:42:43.610
<v Speaker 2>there and things that we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

3492
02:42:43.611 --> 02:42:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stuff that we just,</v>

3493
02:42:45.390 --> 02:42:47.900
<v Speaker 2>we can't explain yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to.</v>

3494
02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure</v>

3495
02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>a concern would look like a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if something comes up and I go,</v>

3496
02:42:53.571 --> 02:42:55.160
<v Speaker 1>where is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

3497
02:42:55.180 --> 02:42:56.900
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about if that's possible.</v>

3498
02:42:56.990 --> 02:43:01.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about looking like fools that </v>

3499
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:05.111
<v Speaker 1>won't go down those roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't say something absolutely </v>

3500
02:43:05.111 --> 02:43:05.111
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3501
02:43:05.111 --> 02:43:09.191
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think the CIA really did kill </v>

3502
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:09.191
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about it.</v>

3503
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:09.191
<v Speaker 1>You think it's possible for them to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy?</v>

3504
02:43:09.191 --> 02:43:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that go,</v>

3505
02:43:10.031 --> 02:43:11.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on now,</v>

3506
02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:14.110
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>

3507
02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Case closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done here.</v>

3508
02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:18.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be that no nonsense guy.</v>

3509
02:43:18.761 --> 02:43:23.761
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look like a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is there's a lot of </v>

3510
02:43:23.761 --> 02:43:27.120
<v Speaker 1>nonsense in the world and if you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>look into things openminded,</v>

3511
02:43:27.130 --> 02:43:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you find that there's some gray and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in almost every subject.</v>

3512
02:43:32.081 --> 02:43:33.430
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucking weirdness.</v>

3513
02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I agree 100 percent for Brian dunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I have to say to him is I'm hired </v>

3514
02:43:43.201 --> 02:43:45.180
<v Speaker 2>some people that like know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3515
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:50.760
<v Speaker 2>read science and critically analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to call yourself a </v>

3516
02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:50.760
<v Speaker 2>science writer for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3517
02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the people like that along with </v>

3518
02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:57.170
<v Speaker 1>people like Dave Asprey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got the information on the,</v>

3519
02:43:57.171 --> 02:43:57.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the study,</v>

3520
02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:03.040
<v Speaker 1>the dietary study incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a real problem with those guys </v>

3521
02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:04.700
<v Speaker 1>because they're not a guy like me who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a fucking expert in anything.</v>

3522
02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked me questions about martial </v>

3523
02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:11.801
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask me questions about standup </v>

3524
02:44:11.801 --> 02:44:11.801
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you the opinion of an expert.</v>

3525
02:44:11.801 --> 02:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I am a true expert in those very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

3526
02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:16.370
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to me about anything else,</v>

3527
02:44:16.371 --> 02:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking read some shit online.</v>

3528
02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert,</v>

3529
02:44:20.451 --> 02:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>but when people start spouting shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>as fact,</v>

3530
02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning on this podcast that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big responsibility that I'm </v>

3531
02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:29.890
<v Speaker 1>learning how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>

3532
02:44:29.891 --> 02:44:34.891
<v Speaker 1>the pitfalls of having people spouting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as fact that aren't necessarily </v>

3533
02:44:35.781 --> 02:44:36.380
<v Speaker 1>factual</v>

3534
02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:40.100
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot about nutrition and science</v>

3535
02:44:40.101 --> 02:44:40.580
<v Speaker 2>and there is a</v>

3536
02:44:40.850 --> 02:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a law that I do not know.</v>

3537
02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that you're honest about it.</v>

3538
02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Know like when I asked you about amino </v>
<v Speaker 1>acids in India,</v>

3539
02:44:47.041 --> 02:44:48.960
<v Speaker 1>taking them without water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right away.</v>

3540
02:44:48.961 --> 02:44:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's great.</v>

3541
02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:54.140
<v Speaker 1>That's how the world should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys like Dave Asprey,</v>

3542
02:44:54.141 --> 02:44:59.141
<v Speaker 1>you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come up with a fucking answer </v>

3543
02:44:59.141 --> 02:45:00.921
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to look stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that answer might be a wise was </v>

3544
02:45:00.921 --> 02:45:01.410
<v Speaker 1>coffee bitter mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you fucking sure?</v>

3545
02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Where's your task that show Mycotoxins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make coffee bitter.</v>

3546
02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:07.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't have anything man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa stop doing that.</v>

3547
02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You've got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're confusing the fuck out of me.</v>

3548
02:45:10.170 --> 02:45:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I parrot what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I confused the fuck out of a bunch of </v>

3549
02:45:15.170 --> 02:45:15.490
<v Speaker 1>people and that happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3550
02:45:15.490 --> 02:45:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3551
02:45:16.321 --> 02:45:19.900
<v Speaker 2>he also talks about the lectins and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beans and it's like and recall it as the</v>

3552
02:45:19.901 --> 02:45:21.310
<v Speaker 2>same thing where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3553
02:45:21.311 --> 02:45:23.200
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some good information,</v>

3554
02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:24.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people have,</v>

3555
02:45:24.191 --> 02:45:25.900
<v Speaker 2>there are some good things that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3556
02:45:26.410 --> 02:45:31.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's also some information that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally wrong and the problem is people </v>

3557
02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:35.730
<v Speaker 2>think because they have one good piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of information that everything they say </v>

3558
02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:36.520
<v Speaker 2>is right and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3559
02:45:36.521 --> 02:45:39.610
<v Speaker 2>and that's where you get this parenting </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

3560
02:45:39.611 --> 02:45:40.750
<v Speaker 2>well there's a meme now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3561
02:45:40.751 --> 02:45:45.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who started it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone started it and it's not </v>

3562
02:45:45.751 --> 02:45:45.751
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3563
02:45:45.751 --> 02:45:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They didn't dig deep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand enough of the </v>

3564
02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:51.451
<v Speaker 2>science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you get everyone following </v>

3565
02:45:51.451 --> 02:45:51.451
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this big following and it's like,</v>

3566
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:54.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you come in and say,</v>

3567
02:45:54.011 --> 02:45:55.870
<v Speaker 2>okay look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it's really happening.</v>

3568
02:45:55.871 --> 02:46:00.871
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of what I'm trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some degree it's not easy and I'm </v>

3569
02:46:01.541 --> 02:46:04.120
<v Speaker 2>doing it in my spare time because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>also still doing research.</v>

3570
02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on weekends I'm like writing articles </v>

3571
02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:09.860
<v Speaker 2>and making videos instead of going out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bay area,</v>

3572
02:46:09.861 --> 02:46:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I freaking love doing it.</v>

3573
02:46:11.841 --> 02:46:12.230
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed this conversation.</v>

3575
02:46:14.181 --> 02:46:19.181
<v Speaker 1>I think you've opened up a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's eyes and you've educated a lot </v>

3576
02:46:19.181 --> 02:46:19.280
<v Speaker 1>of people and provide a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3577
02:46:19.281 --> 02:46:24.281
<v Speaker 1>Almost too much information is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely seeing people writing </v>

3578
02:46:24.281 --> 02:46:25.400
<v Speaker 1>down all these different things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>googling all these different things that</v>

3579
02:46:25.401 --> 02:46:30.401
<v Speaker 1>you've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we could have this </v>

3580
02:46:30.401 --> 02:46:30.401
<v Speaker 1>conversation 100 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
