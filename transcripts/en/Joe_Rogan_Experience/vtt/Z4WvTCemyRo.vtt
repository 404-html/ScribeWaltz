00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was telling you guys at one time my freshman year,</v>

2
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take her shit for a week and a half.</v>

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.721
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

4
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to steak.</v>

5
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:11.684
<v Speaker 1>Comes from American.</v>

6
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.050

7
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:13.884
<v Speaker 1>A French bro.</v>

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.393
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me.</v>

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.733
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I played freshman ball and we were playing Paddison east side.</v>

11
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>That's just a jungle of a school.</v>

12
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta be careful when you go in there.</v>

13
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

14
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>we went there to play the Christmas tournament.</v>

15
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.510
<v Speaker 1>what kind of ball are we talking about?</v>

17
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Basketball and I hadn't taken a shift from like 10 days or something.</v>

18
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I took acid,</v>

19
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

20
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.363
<v Speaker 1>Fuck my stomach.</v>

21
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't tell nobody.</v>

22
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

23
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.551
<v Speaker 1>Home.</v>

24
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>We got on the bus</v>

25
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>and while we were waiting there,</v>

26
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>my stomach started hurting.</v>

27
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.911
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

28
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

29
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm going to shoot myself a Fart,</v>

30
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but let me just take a chance.</v>

31
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>And I blew this far.</v>

32
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.013
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

33
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>that was so bad,</v>

34
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>We want a bus.</v>

36
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And people started running,</v>

37
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>the school buses,</v>

39
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>people started running to the window is right to swing down the bus windows.</v>

40
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>But here's what you got by the Ifr that again,</v>

41
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the teachers are going,</v>

42
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.161

43
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>he's changing flavors.</v>

44
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst thing was the cheerleaders are crying.</v>

45
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad they were sitting in front of a bus.</v>

46
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the teachers yell,</v>

47
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 1>does my God,</v>

48
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:34.024
<v Speaker 1>he's changing.</v>

49
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad these parts.</v>

50
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>We don't mind.</v>

51
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 1>He's changing your whole bus dog fight was fucking God awful.</v>

52
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.180

54
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

56
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
