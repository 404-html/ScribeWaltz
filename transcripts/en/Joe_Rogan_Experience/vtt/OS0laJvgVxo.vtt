00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>His name is Chris Hadfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is and astronauts guide to life</v>

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is in here that that's me.</v>

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never remember.</v>

4
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Rather turn my laptop off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in space for 166 days.</v>

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Mazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when I sit on my dock and watch the</v>

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 1>space station go over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to rationalize cause I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know I was up there and I can remember </v>

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to try and link in life on earth </v>

11
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>with seeing that spotlight go across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got sorted out of my head how </v>

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>to connect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the longest of persons ever been</v>

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.481
<v Speaker 1>up there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a Russian guy named Valerie </v>

16
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:47.481
<v Speaker 1>poliakoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>State of 14 months straight.</v>

17
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>$400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

18
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Stays long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

20
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm nowhere near the record.</v>

21
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>That's still increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 66 days is an incredible </v>

22
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>amount of time to be detached from </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity and floating around in space.</v>

23
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>What is the effect on your body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big effects short term?</v>

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't have to lift the blood</v>

25
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>up to your head when you're weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:14.361
<v Speaker 1>So your whole cardiovascular system </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes all the nice little mechanisms </v>

27
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>that squeeze the balloon that is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body to get the blood up to your head.</v>

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>They stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your heart gets smaller,</v>

29
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you start losing your skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your balance system completely shuts </v>

30
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.571
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it has no stimulus from gravity </v>

31
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you become totally visually based.</v>

32
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So when you come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

33
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Building all those things back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>and most of them you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you lose the callouses on the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet.</v>

36
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of disgusting cause you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure your feet are like a snake up </v>

37
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

38
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Over the bottom of your feet are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shedding because you never used the </v>

39
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.061
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your feet and you build up </v>
<v Speaker 1>calluses on the top because you're </v>

40
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>always tucking your feet underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

41
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've even have to grow the calluses </v>

42
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.371
<v Speaker 1>back in the bottom of your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that takes the longest is </v>

43
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.491
<v Speaker 1>your skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost about eight percent of the bone </v>

44
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.161
<v Speaker 1>across my hips and butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's grown back and within about a year </v>

45
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>of landing all hopefully be back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal one year.</v>

46
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It takes one year for your body to fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

47
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It took about four months before I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>run normally again where my body would </v>

48
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>get the blood out of my feet and pump it</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly back up to my head,</v>

49
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>about four months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost as long as I was up in </v>

50
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

51
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bone takes the longest,</v>

52
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's automatic,</v>

53
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>

54
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>My body got osteoporosis and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversing osteoporosis using some </v>

55
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>internal stimulus that we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

56
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>So it makes a pretty good medical study </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody.</v>

57
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long is.</v>

58
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>How long do you have to be in space </v>
<v Speaker 1>before your body loses so much?</v>

59
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Massive skeleton and the first time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a leak in space,</v>

60
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>your urine is full of calcium and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals.</v>

61
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>We do urine samples all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

62
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what sensors in the body </v>

63
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>recognize that you're weightless or why </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would even have those sensors,</v>

64
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>but your body starts to shed your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeleton right away and we've,</v>

65
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>we can almost beat it now through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy exercise.</v>

66
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:10.231
<v Speaker 1>We have a bunch of equipment on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a resistive exercise and treadmill and </v>

67
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>bicycle and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>and with that we can almost beat it.</v>

69
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>But across my hips and my upper femur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been able to load that area </v>

70
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

71
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You always lift symmetrically on </v>
<v Speaker 1>treadmill.</v>

72
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 1>He always run nice and symmetrically so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get all the banging transverse</v>

73
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>loads that you need to make your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the bones dense there.</v>

74
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So how much of it can you preserve by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using exercise?</v>

75
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>The rest of my body was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

76
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I increased muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased fat a little bit.</v>

77
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>My bones were at the same density.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only place we haven't solved yet is,</v>

78
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>is just the hip cradle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think with another iteration or </v>

79
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>two of our exercise equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get that solved and then I'm going</v>

80
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>to go to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

81
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:52.531
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long are you when you're doing </v>

82
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>exercise to try to build up what </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of your day to doing two </v>

83
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>hours a day?</v>

84
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do one hour of cardiovascular and one</v>

85
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:02.341
<v Speaker 1>hour of resistive every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven days a week for the whole half a </v>

86
00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The up there that we've determined </v>

87
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the best trade off between </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting useful work done,</v>

88
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:10.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a big multinational </v>

89
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>laboratory and keeping your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

90
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>So we we commit about two hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they,</v>

91
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>when they first started going up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they not do anything?</v>

92
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've tried a bunch of different things.</v>

93
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>The Russians even try to suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call a penguin suit,</v>

94
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 1>which is like a set of coveralls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight fitting coveralls that's full of </v>

95
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>elastics so that every time you bend </v>
<v Speaker 1>your elbow or move your twist,</v>

96
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:34.441
<v Speaker 1>your body or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting the resistance of the </v>

97
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>suit because they thought then you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of get it for free,</v>

98
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 1>but you need to demand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to actually heavily force your </v>

99
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>body to exercise and if you do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can stay in shape,</v>

100
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:48.511
<v Speaker 1>we started out with resistive exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>device and that it was the improved I </v>

102
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>read and now we're on a red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the advanced resistive exercise</v>

103
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>device as we've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>how to make it better so that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>we can return to earth healthy or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

106
00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>when we go to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

107
00:04:59.411 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>what we going to.</v>

108
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Maurice Cook takes about half a year to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

109
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

110
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.330
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the problems we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the Mars is really that next level</v>

111
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

113
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like several levels above where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are now.</v>

114
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Station is in orbit around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The space station.</v>

115
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It's been up there 13 years now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on board.</v>

116
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a sailing up and down the </v>

117
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>coast within sight of land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.710
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had it across the body of </v>
<v Speaker 1>water even to go to the moon as far as </v>

119
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.731
<v Speaker 1>habitation goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're just sailing up and </v>

120
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>down the coast of the world figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to beat osteoporosis.</v>

121
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>How did the radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychology of it,</v>

122
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:42.361
<v Speaker 1>the what to make the whole lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make a toilet that works at </v>

123
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:42.361
<v Speaker 1>the closed environmental system.</v>

124
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Got to invent all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I think we'll go to the moon </v>

125
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>because it's the next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only three days away and then we </v>

126
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>can do how to use resources that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

127
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>How do you generate power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you navigate,</v>

128
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>how do you do all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once we got that sorted out,</v>

129
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>then I think we'll go further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still,</v>

130
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of years away.</v>

131
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the big hazards,</v>

132
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>the big hazards or radiation from space </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro meteors?</v>

133
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else?</v>

134
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.760
<v Speaker 1>A psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you keep people sane and it's not</v>

135
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>so bad in the space station because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're close to the world.</v>

136
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.821
<v Speaker 1>There's only like a two second delay </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking on the radio so you can have a </v>

137
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>normal conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little pause.</v>

138
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you start going to maurice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of weeks,</v>

140
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>you will never have another conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with earth and normal and again,</v>

141
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>everything's got so much leg that she'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have like recorded video messages </v>

142
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

143
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And so the psych impact of that is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be high and the earth will shrink to </v>

144
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>just another star within a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

145
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

146
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>those people will become Martians in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

147
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>They will no longer be from Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will see themselves as separate.</v>

148
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 1>When I was on the space station the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second time,</v>

149
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the other crew members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her name is sue Holmes,</v>

150
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she and I were talking,</v>

151
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>we'd known each other since test pilot </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

152
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And in passing a throwaway thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even think she was saying.</v>

153
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

154
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:05.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth said that we're supposed to do </v>

155
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:05.051
<v Speaker 1>this next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my mind,</v>

156
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:05.051
<v Speaker 1>not heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth said,</v>

157
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I heard those words come out of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

158
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And it was like she has in her mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely split off from the other 7 </v>

159
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 1>billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's her crew and earth is one </v>

160
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>singular identifiable entity on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side and that was a real bell </v>

161
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.870
<v Speaker 1>ringer to me of what it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go to Maurice.</v>

162
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Those people are going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely discrete unit of people and </v>

163
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Speaker 1>there'll be Martians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't be earthlinks pretty quick.</v>

164
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Their heads and how do you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

165
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>How do we plan for that and it's still a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long ways in the future,</v>

166
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the many things we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort out before we.</v>

167
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Because as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get the engines going fast </v>

168
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>enough that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're headed for Mars.</v>

169
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You can't just turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no coming back.</v>

170
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Apollo Thirteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:54.671
<v Speaker 1>They lost an engine on the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon that coasted all the way to the </v>

173
00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>moon and they just used like a ball on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of a string.</v>

174
00:07:55.971 --> 00:08:00.971
<v Speaker 1>They just went around the moon with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity of the moon to sling them back </v>

175
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:03.611
<v Speaker 1>at Earth again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if something failed on the way to </v>

176
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:03.611
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do the same thing,</v>

177
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>but it would take a year.</v>

178
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem can normally last a year to </v>

179
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>get resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pretty much,</v>

180
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:14.441
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa have all the problems solved </v>

181
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:16.031
<v Speaker 1>before you head that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about like sustainable </v>

182
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:16.031
<v Speaker 1>resources?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as far as like food and things like</v>

183
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they have to when they have to terra</v>

184
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>form when they get to Mars and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

185
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really interesting discovery about</v>

186
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>three weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curiosity,</v>

187
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that big rover that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is driving around on Mars right now</v>

188
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>has some pretty good equipment on it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it discovered just in the last few weeks</v>

189
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>that in every cubic foot of dirt on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars,</v>

190
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a quart of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's oceans of water.</v>

191
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean the topsoil is full of water on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>

192
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's really promising for when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there.</v>

193
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because water is hydrogen and oxygen and</v>

194
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>oxygen to breathe hydrogen and oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix fuel,</v>

195
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen makes water.</v>

196
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's a huge resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon,</v>

197
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>there's water there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really rare,</v>

198
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.450
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big discovery for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually being able to go there,</v>

199
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a power source.</v>

200
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>The Sun's a long ways away and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dusty on Mars.</v>

201
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a solar powered </v>

202
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>bulldozer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you need a power source and we need how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you navigate and there's just a </v>

204
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.311
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you build a perfect closed loop </v>

205
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:30.351
<v Speaker 1>environmental system so that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a constant losses and because the </v>

206
00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:34.401
<v Speaker 1>space station we only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about 92 percent of our </v>

207
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:37.671
<v Speaker 1>water we reclaim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we constantly need that little </v>

208
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>trickle from earth of new water because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>

209
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole.</v>

210
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stuff we did when don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know what we don't know yet and </v>

211
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>that's I think why will we'll start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of that out on the moon.</v>

212
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Before we launched a Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

213
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:52.911
<v Speaker 1>watching the footage of the rover and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the images that had sent back was almost</v>

214
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem real.</v>

215
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for me to wrap my head around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they sent a robot to </v>

216
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.091
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's roaming around taking pictures and </v>

217
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:05.091
<v Speaker 1>sending them back and we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

218
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's phenomenal.</v>

219
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible that we could do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and the way that,</v>

220
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maurice has has just the wrong </v>

221
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not thick enough to use a parachute</v>

222
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:20.571
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not thin enough that you can </v>

223
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:20.571
<v Speaker 1>ignore it and just and just slow down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and land with a rocket.</v>

224
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:20.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

225
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for landing.</v>

226
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 1>The Earth's atmosphere is nice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thick.</v>

227
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 1>You can come down under a parachute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon has none,</v>

228
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>so you can just like the Apollo guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just land on your rocket plume.</v>

229
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Maurice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of stuck in the middle,</v>

230
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 1>so you need a complex landing system and</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>

231
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>The way they came up with a solution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just phenomenal.</v>

232
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:44.451
<v Speaker 1>The big Arrow break through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere and then that sequence of </v>

233
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>miracles and the retro rockets and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extendable bridal and everything.</v>

234
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:51.261
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing that that worked and huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kudos to the jpl guys and everybody who </v>

235
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:55.881
<v Speaker 1>came up with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the stuff it's teaching us </v>

236
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>about how planets work and what is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the past and the future for that </v>

237
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.700
<v Speaker 1>planet Mars and therefore gives us a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better understanding of what's normal </v>

238
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

239
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>what can we can expect on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge Kudos to those people.</v>

240
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

241
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>they did an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing thing and just one of those,</v>

242
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:17.661
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those paradigm shifting moments </v>

243
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>where when we're back here on earth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching those images,</v>

244
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

245
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>they can do this now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an astronaut,</v>

246
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.470
<v Speaker 1>an astronaut and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in space twice and I gathered </v>

247
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>my family around to watch that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened because it's so.</v>

248
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It is right on the edge of what we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just barely do.</v>

249
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's such a brave thing to do and such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable probe,</v>

250
00:11:36.281 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 1>a capable extension of assault to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on the surface and it's teaching us</v>

251
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:45.261
<v Speaker 1>about Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever pay any attention to the </v>

252
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:45.261
<v Speaker 1>face on Mars or any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

253
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>That's all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

254
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

255
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 1>there's faces all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

256
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 1>just lay on your back and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>

257
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>There's faces everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

258
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>That's sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We naturally look for faces,</v>

259
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.750
<v Speaker 2>especially in weird shadowy images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those images were mean.</v>

260
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.760
<v Speaker 2>There were some really unique things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a rock near my house that's a </v>

261
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 2>square rock and when I have a friend who</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes in a lot of conspiracy theories</v>

262
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and he believes in the face on Mars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different stuff,</v>

263
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you something,</v>

264
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come over here.</v>

265
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that rock.</v>

266
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you think anybody made that rock?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That rock has just made.</v>

267
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 2>That's just a rock amongst the pile of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks.</v>

268
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 2>It's big and it's kind of square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Perfectly Square,</v>

269
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 2>but if you looked at a blurry picture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that was taken from space,</v>

270
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you would swear this is the building </v>
<v Speaker 2>block for a paramed.</v>

271
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's clearly made by an intelligent </v>

272
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:29.580
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same one that built the pyramids.</v>

273
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

274
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.411
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always easier to believe something </v>

275
00:12:34.411 --> 00:12:34.411
<v Speaker 2>than it is to understand it.</v>

276
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fascinating thing about the face on </v>

277
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Mars is not that it looks like a face on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>

278
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.810
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that Mars at one point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time actually could have sustained some </v>

279
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 2>form of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

280
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 2>definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had an atmosphere that was livable at</v>

281
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 2>one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really.</v>

282
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:57.391
<v Speaker 2>There could've been some kind of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was just like microbes or </v>

283
00:12:57.391 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 2>plants or might still is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>volcano in the solar system,</v>

284
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 2>so it has heat and it has all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

285
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 2>but we've just found now for sure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat and water on earth always means </v>

286
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 2>life to me and just look under your sink</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

287
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 2>On Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's a fossil record of it.</v>

288
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's even something still </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive stuff living somewhere in the </v>

289
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 2>rock we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't found any yet,</v>

290
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>but if we can find that on Mars and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know this life on earth and there's life</v>

291
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:28.471
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and that would be a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing to figure out or the </v>

292
00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:31.621
<v Speaker 2>possibility that life actually started </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mars and some sort of an impact from </v>

293
00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:34.470
<v Speaker 2>an asteroid panspermia senate hurling </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards birth.</v>

294
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's a logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

295
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

296
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>if life can start somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it can start in two places.</v>

297
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it doesn't have to miraculously </v>

298
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.711
<v Speaker 2>be Panspermia from one planet to another</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it formed on Mars than and there's </v>

299
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:53.941
<v Speaker 2>life on earth and it's a more logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion to think that it just formed </v>

300
00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:54.980
<v Speaker 2>in two places I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

301
00:13:54.981 --> 00:13:59.981
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you sit in that space station and </v>

302
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:03.181
<v Speaker 2>you're floating above earth much as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying that your colleague started </v>

303
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:06.901
<v Speaker 2>referring to Earth as a separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual entity and you guys were </v>

304
00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:10.741
<v Speaker 2>separate from Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you look out when you're looking at </v>

305
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>the vastness of everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just everything.</v>

306
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:19.150
<v Speaker 2>And Dee dee did feel like earth was in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood more like,</v>

307
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we weren't isolated.</v>

308
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:24.880
<v Speaker 2>That where it's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is so big.</v>

309
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like more connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the universe in any sort of a </v>

310
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.531
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe And you're in the side of the </v>

311
00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:36.421
<v Speaker 2>spaceship and you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at it through the </v>

312
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 2>windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I came back,</v>

313
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it was so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back from my first space flight </v>

314
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 2>and was sitting in the living room with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife Halena and we were watching star</v>

315
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 2>trek and they show that scene with Sulu </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whoever upfront and there's the,</v>

316
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.120
<v Speaker 2>there were in the standard orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Sulo and there's the curve of the </v>

317
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.120
<v Speaker 2>earth underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember going,</v>

318
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what</v>

319
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got that right.</v>

320
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>They guessed right in 1968 or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

321
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaceship,</v>

322
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is when you go outside </v>

323
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 1>and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

324
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like the difference between sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your living room,</v>

325
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 1>looking outside and hanging on a cliff </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

326
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:14.591
<v Speaker 1>hanging on half dome or somewhere where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an entirely different perspective </v>

327
00:15:14.591 --> 00:15:15.290
<v Speaker 1>even though it may look at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

328
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Being outside is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so immersive.</v>

329
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>The world is no longer nicely underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

330
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 1>like dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Sulu,</v>

331
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is this huge hanging,</v>

332
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 1>a spinning mass next to you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is what's around you and you </v>

333
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are part of it.</v>

334
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:39.041
<v Speaker 1>You're suspended in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that we aren't used to have in the </v>

335
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:39.041
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under our feet,</v>

336
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.220
<v Speaker 1>on all around us and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling that you're in it not just </v>

337
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of blow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking up at it and that is really </v>

338
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.401
<v Speaker 1>different and that's when you really see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world is just in the </v>

339
00:15:51.401 --> 00:15:55.331
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and that it is a ball with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon being a ball in the son's over </v>

340
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

341
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>And if we go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Maurice.</v>

342
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.460
<v Speaker 1>You really get that feeling when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>out on a space walk.</v>

343
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I've heard several astronauts talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling and that that moment when </v>

344
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.501
<v Speaker 2>they are outside of the spacecraft and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the universe itself and </v>

345
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.410
<v Speaker 2>saying that it changed them forever.</v>

346
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gave me a profound respect and also </v>

347
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

348
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean nobody knows the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

349
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang and all the rest of it and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

350
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 1>all the belief systems around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how everybody deals with all that.</v>

351
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And I sure don't know the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

352
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

353
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to convince yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's random.</v>

354
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how can that possibly be?</v>

355
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look a little further out,</v>

356
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.320
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.910
<v Speaker 1>how could maurice be random and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>could all the other planets,</v>

358
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:51.911
<v Speaker 1>how could Saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it looks to be just a random </v>

359
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:51.911
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

360
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:51.911
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

361
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:56.560
<v Speaker 1>the unlimited number of stars that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and the planets we're seeing </v>

362
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 1>around other stars directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to resolve it.</v>

363
00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 1>In my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

364
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

365
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 1>find the meaning of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like being on a spacewalk,</v>

366
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just deepened my dumb foundedness at </v>

367
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

368
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 1>at the immensity of it in our tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>little part of it.</v>

369
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought that questions </v>

370
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.400
<v Speaker 2>pondering questions like the randomness </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the universe or the,</v>

371
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>just the reality that we know about </v>
<v Speaker 2>subatomic particles and the idea of the </v>

372
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.670
<v Speaker 2>universe being this fractal thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible and never ending.</v>

373
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it's almost like walking up to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain and going,</v>

374
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:32.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see how that could be picked up,</v>

375
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.800
<v Speaker 2>but you can't really pick it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

376
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:35.640
<v Speaker 2>So you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

377
00:17:35.641 --> 00:17:38.010
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it could be random.</v>

378
00:17:38.011 --> 00:17:43.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what the fuck random </v>

379
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:46.791
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of random seems the universe </v>

380
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:49.671
<v Speaker 2>itself seems to be this incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex thing has not just laws but very</v>

381
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.320
<v Speaker 2>clear directions that things move into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It constantly is complexifying from the </v>

382
00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>big bang till now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea of black holes,</v>

383
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:05.361
<v Speaker 2>the eating matter and creating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>singularity and that possibly these new,</v>

384
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.580
<v Speaker 2>these new astrophysicists and string </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorist guys are saying that they think</v>

385
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 2>that inside every black home may in fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a completely different universe.</v>

386
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You know on the top of the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>station,</v>

387
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:23.601
<v Speaker 1>we have a experiment put there by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize winning physicist named Sam </v>

388
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Ting and it's from cern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the big particle accelerator that's</v>

389
00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Switzerland and France to their baby</v>

390
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge magnet and what it's doing </v>

391
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.210
<v Speaker 1>is collecting subatomic particles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and it's.</v>

392
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It's got layer after layer of detector </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can try and figure out what they </v>

393
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.841
<v Speaker 1>all are as they come ripping through and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's collected trillions and trillions </v>

394
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:51.141
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been up there for the last couple </v>

395
00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 1>of years and the reason is we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the universe is made of.</v>

396
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200
<v Speaker 1>We can only account for five percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe with the known particles </v>

397
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.311
<v Speaker 1>that we have five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what 95 percent of the </v>

398
00:19:01.311 --> 00:19:04.551
<v Speaker 1>universities even made of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we call it dark energy and dark </v>

399
00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:08.391
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to indirectly prove </v>

400
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:11.450
<v Speaker 1>that those exist based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportions of the subatomic particles </v>

401
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.480
<v Speaker 1>were collecting up in the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space station and it's a decade,</v>

402
00:19:13.481 --> 00:19:16.650
<v Speaker 1>a long project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they released the first layer of the</v>

403
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:19.830
<v Speaker 1>results back in the spring and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to look like,</v>

404
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.540
<v Speaker 1>like maybe some of the theories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

405
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:23.940
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>we've talked as if were were </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusively brilliant and we understand</v>

407
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

408
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're still calling things dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and dark energy.</v>

409
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:32.790
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to figure it out.</v>

410
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>That's another word for magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is indeed.</v>

411
00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:37.330
<v Speaker 2>It's another word for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

412
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

413
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.800
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are most certainly the smartest and </v>

414
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.170
<v Speaker 2>the most informed human beings that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever existed as far as we know,</v>

415
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 2>the two of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

416
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.520
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denying me 100 percent.</v>

417
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like humans that have ever</v>

418
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:55.030
<v Speaker 2>lived where the the most informed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most technologically capable,</v>

419
00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.630
<v Speaker 2>but much like when we look back at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>renaissance era,</v>

420
00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:03.631
<v Speaker 2>or we'll look back at Galileo being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison because he dared question the </v>

421
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.200
<v Speaker 2>idea that the earth wasn't the center of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

422
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.680
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make fun of us some day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make fun of us like </v>

423
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.770
<v Speaker 2>these dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what Clark was glue on.</v>

424
00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:16.771
<v Speaker 2>Plasma was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to use a particle accelerator </v>

425
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:17.020
<v Speaker 2>to prove that the Higgs Boson existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

426
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at the space shuttle</v>

427
00:20:18.821 --> 00:20:20.730
<v Speaker 2>and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were they thinking?</v>

428
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm at station wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just so ridiculous.</v>

429
00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Like a DC three now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

430
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing I really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up with you.</v>

431
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

432
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:34.150
<v Speaker 2>you had to take one of those up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take some sort of a </v>

433
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.400
<v Speaker 2>spaceship up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the feeling like of good?</v>

434
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to get an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Russian one?</v>

435
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.150
<v Speaker 1>My first two flights were on shuttles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flew Atlantis and then endeavor and </v>

436
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.420
<v Speaker 1>then my third flight I was left seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sorta like the pilot of the Soyuz,</v>

437
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>so I flown them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

438
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.340
<v Speaker 2>So you flew when the space shuttle was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in operation and you flew the Russian </v>

439
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 2>version of the space shuttle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

440
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.460
<v Speaker 1>The shuttle is is so much more capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the most capable flying machine </v>

441
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 1>humans have ever built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

442
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And three quarters of everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever flown in space flew on the shuttle.</v>

443
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:13.711
<v Speaker 1>It was the first great lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's purpose was to take a huge spy </v>

444
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:19.711
<v Speaker 1>satellite up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the conception of the sixties </v>

445
00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:19.711
<v Speaker 1>and early seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the best technology.</v>

446
00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 1>60 spy satellite launch out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vandenberg.</v>

447
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Go straight north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go halfway around the world,</v>

448
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.260
<v Speaker 1>take pictures of the hot spots of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

449
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.440
<v Speaker 1>come back again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then use the wings to be able to go </v>

450
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.981
<v Speaker 1>sort of sideways and side slip because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's turned underneath you and </v>

451
00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>come back and land again after one </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>

452
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why we had wings on the shuttle </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so that we could carry this huge </v>

453
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 1>telescope and they weren't automated </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

454
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:44.410
<v Speaker 1>so we needed a crew to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate the telescope.</v>

455
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's why the payload bay was the size </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was and why the shuttle could </v>

456
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>lift the amount that it could lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to meet all those requirements.</v>

457
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That all immediately stopped being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for the space shuttle to exist,</v>

458
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but the design was already set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that gave us though was a vehicle </v>

459
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 1>that could carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

460
00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 1>40 or 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds up in a payload bay that's a size</v>

461
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:11.671
<v Speaker 1>of a city bus and then bring it back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>land it gently on a runway and carry a </v>

462
00:22:11.671 --> 00:22:16.351
<v Speaker 1>crew up to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is like a space station all on its </v>

463
00:22:16.351 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 1>own and amazingly capable vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly complex too.</v>

464
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And when things are amazingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really expensive and hard to </v>

465
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.580
<v Speaker 1>operate safely and we lost two crews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 1>as a result of the complexity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Soyuz is designed to take three </v>

467
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 1>people and a tiny bit of gear up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space station doc.</v>

468
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Stay there for half a year or longer as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lifeboat and then at the end of </v>

469
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.240
<v Speaker 1>time get back in and come back home </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

470
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the uses purpose and it does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>

471
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's tiny and very purpose built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two of them are magnificent </v>

472
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 1>vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but built for way different purposes and</v>

473
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 1>both very carefully evolved to do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

474
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>exquisitely well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

476
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky to have flown on both.</v>

477
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.520
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 2>What is the g force field like when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take an off from the,</v>

479
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.040
<v Speaker 1>the launchpad you go straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you have to get above the air.</v>

480
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

481
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stay in orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go five miles a second.</v>

482
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.560
<v Speaker 1>If you're going a little slower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

483
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like throwing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>

484
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It gravity pulls it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can throw it sideways at five</v>

485
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>miles a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then gravity will still pull it down.</v>

486
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But the earth curves away underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's going fast enough,</v>

487
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

488
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.870
<v Speaker 1>goes over the horizon before it falls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how we stay at orbit is we go </v>

489
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 1>five miles a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't go five miles second in </v>

490
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:44.881
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frictions just too high.</v>

491
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So the rocket ships take you straight up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you above the air.</v>

492
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And that takes about two minutes going </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up and in 45 seconds here </v>

493
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 1>through the speed of sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up and accelerating.</v>

494
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And in 70 seconds you're through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>altitude and speed of the concord </v>

495
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:01.330
<v Speaker 1>accelerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

496
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And after two minutes here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 160,000</v>

497
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:07.610
<v Speaker 1>feet and six times the speed of sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're above almost all of the air.</v>

498
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And then your first stage falls off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So inside it's this,</v>

499
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>it's this incredibly powerful push in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your back like a dragster.</v>

500
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 1>But like one that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gone off the road,</v>

501
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the vibration of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

502
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 1>pushing through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

503
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:27.551
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tuning fork kind of </v>

504
00:24:27.551 --> 00:24:29.831
<v Speaker 1>vibration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This enormous powerful jaws of a dog </v>

505
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of ride straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then after two minutes,</v>

506
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:36.570
<v Speaker 1>the solids are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage that got you above the air,</v>

507
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.620
<v Speaker 1>all out of fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It explodes off because you don't want </v>

508
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:41.620
<v Speaker 1>to carry all that dead weight with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

509
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you use the remaining engines </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next six minutes or six and a </v>

510
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 1>half to accelerate out horizontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically to five miles a second.</v>

511
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for the last six minutes,</v>

512
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like a long liquid drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>

513
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 1>steady pushing someone with their fist </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your back,</v>

514
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>pushing you faster and faster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

515
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>smoother ride because you're above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ear.</v>

516
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.270
<v Speaker 1>And after just under nine minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight,</v>

517
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 or so,</v>

518
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right direction,</v>

519
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 1>and the right speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the engine shut off.</v>

520
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And you're in space and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightless.</v>

521
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's nine minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

522
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's 8:42</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the shuttle and just under nine,</v>

523
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 1>like 8:55</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Soyuz.</v>

524
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.820
<v Speaker 1>What's the maximum g force you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced during that?</v>

525
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shuttles about three g.</v>

526
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.220
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hit three g with the throttle </v>

527
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.231
<v Speaker 1>start coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was only built for about </v>

528
00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:35.231
<v Speaker 1>three and a half g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three times your normal weights.</v>

529
00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 1>If he weighed 200 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weigh 600 pounds in there.</v>

530
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 1>The so use is about four or four and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

531
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're 200 pounds a year up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

532
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

533
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.350
<v Speaker 1>900 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a ride with the blue angels and </v>

534
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>whether those f eighteens ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nfat pilot for a lot of years.</v>

535
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Those are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great airplane.</v>

536
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You got to fly those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

537
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.130
<v Speaker 1>What's the most jeezy pulled in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment?</v>

538
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.180
<v Speaker 1>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take an f 18 and you grabbed the </v>

539
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:01.890
<v Speaker 1>stick and you snap it into your lap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

540
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you aren't actually connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything except a computer.</v>

541
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>It's little sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fly by wire.</v>

542
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.520
<v Speaker 1>So it says wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to turn right now.</v>

543
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>And so then it moves all the control </v>
<v Speaker 1>surfaces of the airplane,</v>

544
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't want to break the wings </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

545
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So it will limit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

546
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the airplane limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of Ge that it can pull and </v>

547
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.720
<v Speaker 1>it'll give you about eight g about age.</v>

548
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.520
<v Speaker 1>That's all it will give you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you could structurally damaged</v>

549
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 1>the airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a paddle,</v>

550
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are going to hit the ground,</v>

551
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you could hit this paddle that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>override the g control system and snap </v>

552
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.421
<v Speaker 1>it in your lap and just give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the aerodynamics would give </v>

553
00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had people pull 12 g but uh,</v>

554
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but the Soyuz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you come into the atmosphere the </v>

555
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 1>wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can pull 20 or 22 g on the way home,</v>

556
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wicked.</v>

557
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:55.071
<v Speaker 1>And that happened once in the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience live that you're lying down </v>

558
00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.380
<v Speaker 1>when you're in fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like when you flew with the Blue </v>

559
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Angels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting upright.</v>

560
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So when you pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pushes the g,</v>

561
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 1>the blood down to your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real limitation is how much of </v>

562
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.250
<v Speaker 1>that can you stand before you can't.</v>

563
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't stay awake for your blackout </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a Soyuz we're actually laying on her </v>

564
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>back so the blood doesn't drain out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head.</v>

565
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 1>It just gets kind of pushed to the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body.</v>

566
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So therefore you can survive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't block you out,</v>

567
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't damage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

568
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's sorta like a prolonged car crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>people pull 20 g in a car crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's instantaneous if you fall into </v>

570
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere the wrong way in a Soyuz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then as you hit the thick atmosphere,</v>

571
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:40.070
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like crashing into something</v>
<v Speaker 1>super high gp for maybe 30 seconds and </v>

572
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>then then you come through that gp can </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down and it's survivable.</v>

573
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't want to write it.</v>

574
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.270
<v Speaker 2>That feeling must be just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

575
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 2>what are the thoughts that are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your mind when you're,</v>

576
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 2>when you're going that fast shooting up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this space.</v>

577
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

578
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

579
00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm focusing on the job because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a million things that can fail and one </v>

580
00:28:03.651 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 1>of the mantras of astronauts is there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem so bad that you can't make it</v>

581
00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:10.220
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we think of it that all the time.</v>

582
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.550
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really are careful in the way up and </v>

583
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:15.550
<v Speaker 1>so a big part of you is involved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

584
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but another part of you is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just loving the ride so much.</v>

585
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And I found after a while that my cheeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hurting and I was like,</v>

586
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.960
<v Speaker 1>why is my face hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized because this smile,</v>

587
00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:31.961
<v Speaker 1>this big stupid smile on my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of my cheeks were cramping up </v>

588
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:35.000
<v Speaker 1>because it was so much of a thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing.</v>

589
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like heaven.</v>

590
00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one one,</v>

591
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.830
<v Speaker 1>those two people on your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's being all serious in one </v>

592
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.411
<v Speaker 1>that's yelling bad advice to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that's having a good time is </v>

593
00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:44.411
<v Speaker 1>just going ahead.</v>

594
00:28:44.411 --> 00:28:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I just love on the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so much fun.</v>

595
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Guess that's a good time to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

596
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Because you're completely helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

597
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helpless</v>

598
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.170
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

599
00:28:53.171 --> 00:28:53.650
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

600
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.860
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for on the way up in the way</v>

601
00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.320
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in the is when you lying down.</v>

602
00:28:59.340 --> 00:28:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the suite.</v>

603
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.710
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full control panel and there's stuff you</v>

604
00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:04.790
<v Speaker 1>have to do or you have to do as it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

605
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

606
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

607
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.200
<v Speaker 1>While you're flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everything works perfectly,</v>

608
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.090
<v Speaker 1>we're just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

609
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.710
<v Speaker 1>and same in the shuttle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have very,</v>

610
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully don't have to do anything,</v>

611
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes things don't go right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got a bunch of things you can </v>

612
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.580
<v Speaker 1>various shutdowns in a board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain people probably don't know,</v>

614
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:22.450
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

615
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.700
<v Speaker 1>the shuttle as it launched up the east </v>
<v Speaker 1>coast of theu ,</v>

616
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.570
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

617
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.540
<v Speaker 1>we kept abort landing runways all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up to coast.</v>

618
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:30.700
<v Speaker 1>You could land at Cherry point or can </v>
<v Speaker 1>land in New York,</v>

619
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you could land in Newfoundland or all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those places.</v>

620
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And so as you're ticket up the coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly going,</v>

621
00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:37.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a failure,</v>

622
00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:42.031
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to abort this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to turn around and land in </v>

623
00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:42.031
<v Speaker 1>Bermuda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to land here,</v>

624
00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:44.070
<v Speaker 1>we're going to land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you practice those like crazy.</v>

625
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Then you get to a certain point and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would land in North Africa or South </v>

626
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 1>France or in Spain and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

627
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:52.810
<v Speaker 1>all those tick points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>

628
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:53.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thresholds.</v>

629
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to get your word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're hyper aware of.</v>

630
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:57.550
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not along for the ride.</v>

631
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while this is all going on,</v>

632
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you have these big giant smile and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>still are calculating.</v>

633
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still going?</v>

634
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it screws up now I go here.</v>

635
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run into my thumb down a long list of </v>

636
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.830
<v Speaker 1>all the various wickets that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping through.</v>

637
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention.</v>

638
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.830
<v Speaker 1>How much of the trip is automated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is manual?</v>

639
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like it to be as automated as </v>

640
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.560
<v Speaker 1>possible because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

641
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that means things are predictable and</v>

642
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>things didn't break and for the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of shuttle flights.</v>

643
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 1>And so he was flights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's automated,</v>

644
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the way up hill and we've had </v>

645
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.801
<v Speaker 1>engines fail or engine start to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to shut engines down and go to </v>

646
00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:40.801
<v Speaker 1>backup or at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 1>a reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a configuration of the engines.</v>

648
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.460
<v Speaker 1>You get the launch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

649
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.350
<v Speaker 1>During lunch that happened at a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shots.</v>

650
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It happened on Apollo as well on the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Earth.</v>

651
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had serious problems with the </v>

652
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Soyuz where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

653
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you have to take over and try and fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>manually or come in ballistically,</v>

654
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>which means it loses its ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>steer on the way home and you just start</v>

655
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 1>spinning the vehicle and then it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in like,</v>

656
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 1>like a pure media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

657
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And you pull about eight or nine g on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballistic entry and that's,</v>

658
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

659
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty tough after six months of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightlessness to suddenly,</v>

660
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're a 200 now a 1600 or 1700 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

661
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

662
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.320
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty hard on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

663
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.550
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible the feeling that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>must have had when you actually stepped </v>

664
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 1>onto ground again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>

665
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

666
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so nauseous and dizzy.</v>

667
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

668
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:39.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason is of course,</v>

669
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.860
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vision is telling you one thing,</v>

670
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 1>telling you where the horizon is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where up is,</v>

671
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 1>but your inner ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which normally when your eyes are </v>

672
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you from falling over.</v>

673
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:54.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can close your eyes and not fall </v>

674
00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:54.151
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has forgotten completely what to do</v>

675
00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 1>with gravity because you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightless first,</v>

676
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six months.</v>

677
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.120
<v Speaker 1>So now you have this sudden great </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent disagreement between what your </v>

678
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.150
<v Speaker 1>eyes are saying and what your inner ear </v>
<v Speaker 1>is saying.</v>

679
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you spend 50 times and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop spinning and you stagger around,</v>

680
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.720
<v Speaker 1>so your body says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

681
00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.780
<v Speaker 1>there is something seriously wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is his vision so wildly different </v>

682
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>than his inner ear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the last million years,</v>

683
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 1>one of the probable cause is was you ate</v>
<v Speaker 1>something poisonous.</v>

684
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:27.931
<v Speaker 1>You ate some sort of neurotoxin or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is messing up your </v>

685
00:32:27.931 --> 00:32:31.561
<v Speaker 1>internal systems and it might kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing your body makes you </v>

686
00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>want to do is throw up because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get rid of whatever it was you</v>

687
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:39.241
<v Speaker 1>just ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing your body makes </v>

688
00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:39.241
<v Speaker 1>me want to do is go lay down and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

689
00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Stopped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

690
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to keep you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you first get back from space,</v>

691
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 1>your body's just screaming at you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up and glide down.</v>

692
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

693
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got all this stuff to do and people </v>

694
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.111
<v Speaker 1>were there to meet you and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to just ignore those </v>

695
00:32:56.111 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 1>symptoms and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pay attention to what,</v>

696
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

697
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Is there a happiness along with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

698
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.880
<v Speaker 2>is there a feeling of being home?</v>

699
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

700
00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:09.181
<v Speaker 1>all three of my flights and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the flight went well and we work </v>

701
00:33:09.181 --> 00:33:12.871
<v Speaker 1>hard enough that they almost always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great sense of satisfaction </v>

702
00:33:12.871 --> 00:33:17.140
<v Speaker 1>because we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the final step in an extremely</v>

703
00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:22.141
<v Speaker 1>complicated process where you have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything right or enough things right </v>

704
00:33:22.141 --> 00:33:22.180
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can like Kinda have that for the </v>

706
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

707
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of joy and pride and accomplishment.</v>

708
00:33:31.421 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And when you get back to Earth,</v>

709
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:38.190
<v Speaker 2>I have always been fascinated by space </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look up you can see the </v>

710
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.070
<v Speaker 2>lights here are covered with sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

711
00:33:39.071 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I like your lights stars good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

712
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.740
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what drives me nuts is how little we </v>

713
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.970
<v Speaker 2>actually get to see of the stars because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of light pollution.</v>

714
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I was a at the big island and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Keck observatory.</v>

715
00:33:52.961 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's the,</v>

716
00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:57.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a station where the telescope is</v>

717
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.280
<v Speaker 2>and then below that at like 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

718
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:02.170
<v Speaker 2>There's like this visitor station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been?</v>

719
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been near there.</v>

720
00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:08.311
<v Speaker 2>I put up at the top of a couple of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains there to have a look at the </v>

721
00:34:08.311 --> 00:34:08.311
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in incredible.</v>

722
00:34:08.311 --> 00:34:08.950
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

723
00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

724
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.700
<v Speaker 2>when we were driving up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was worried that it was too cloudy.</v>

725
00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

726
00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:14.980
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.590
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to go and see the stars and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>picked a cloudy night,</v>

728
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but we drove through the clouds.</v>

729
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And then when you get above there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize that the entire big island,</v>

730
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.780
<v Speaker 2>they have special diffused lighting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that they don't emit light </v>

731
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.340
<v Speaker 2>pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The view is life changing.</v>

732
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:35.490
<v Speaker 2>It must be like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1000000th of what you experience on the </v>

733
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:40.200
<v Speaker 2>space station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me it was a real life changing </v>

734
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.291
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget it and I'll think </v>

735
00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:43.291
<v Speaker 2>about it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I look at the stars,</v>

736
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I always think about that night in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii,</v>

737
00:34:45.161 --> 00:34:46.260
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

738
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.420
<v Speaker 2>but even crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

739
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.460
<v Speaker 2>there's an image of it up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even crazier when you're actually </v>

740
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.060
<v Speaker 2>experiencing and you could see the Milky</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way,</v>

741
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.710
<v Speaker 2>and I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

742
00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:01.950
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure out a way to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>light pollution because I think just </v>

743
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.791
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just being able to look up and see that </v>

744
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:08.550
<v Speaker 2>would change people's perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>would probably make people way more </v>

745
00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:10.240
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about space.</v>

746
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.700
<v Speaker 1>People know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the vast majority of people </v>

747
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:15.870
<v Speaker 1>live in cities and the places that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst light pollution of the city.</v>

748
00:35:15.871 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>So I had a similar experience to yours </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in fat pilot.</v>

749
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I would get it up to high altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on a cross country,</v>

750
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:27.911
<v Speaker 1>especially in the north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on the autopilot and it's shut off </v>

751
00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:28.100
<v Speaker 1>every light in the cockpit and let my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes adjust.</v>

752
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And you're already up at 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45,000</v>

753
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:35.291
<v Speaker 1>feet and so there's almost no atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>above you and you could see the texture </v>

754
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:37.440
<v Speaker 1>of space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the Milky Way.</v>

755
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 1>You can see why it's called the Milky </v>
<v Speaker 1>Way.</v>

756
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

757
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray,</v>

758
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>white part of the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and you don't need a telescope to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

760
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:50.661
<v Speaker 1>You can just see it with your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need some special time lapse </v>

761
00:35:50.661 --> 00:35:50.661
<v Speaker 1>photography.</v>

762
00:35:50.661 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

763
00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

764
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both humbling and uh,</v>

765
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and really inspiring I think to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts everything into perspective,</v>

766
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:05.330
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're trying to work on light </v>

767
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.581
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are indoor creatures and cities </v>

768
00:36:07.581 --> 00:36:10.281
<v Speaker 1>and they have street lights and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive around in cars and I don't know </v>

769
00:36:10.281 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 1>how you get people to notice the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe around them.</v>

770
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it would help if they could just</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it start.</v>

771
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 1>If you look up in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ca,</v>

772
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Speaker 1>what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a star.</v>

773
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Houston for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

774
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see 18 stairs tonight.</v>

775
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a real clear night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely.</v>

776
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.110
<v Speaker 1>But when you're up there and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the observatory and I'm sure when </v>

777
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:33.110
<v Speaker 1>you were at 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet in the jet,</v>

778
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.970
<v Speaker 1>it must have been amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

779
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:35.560
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

780
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that much further away.</v>

781
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the big island mountain is not all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

783
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 1>but you just need one sometimes one </v>
<v Speaker 1>small step and you can see a whole new </v>

784
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.220
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

785
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.931
<v Speaker 1>I had some similar but not quite as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense viewings in the mountains above </v>

786
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

787
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 1>So like at 8,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet up there,</v>

788
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:59.121
<v Speaker 1>it was beautiful too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that we forget that we're </v>

789
00:36:59.121 --> 00:37:03.321
<v Speaker 1>really in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as stupid as that sounds really do </v>

790
00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:07.041
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going around the world and my </v>

791
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 1>son who ran the social media for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight to a large degree,</v>

792
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>send me a note saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey dad,</v>

793
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Mt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etna is erupting in southern Italy,</v>

794
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 1>have a look of Mount Etna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a good dad.</v>

795
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Took a picture of how Aetna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm seeing the superheated lava and </v>

796
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:21.930
<v Speaker 1>the smoke and the steam coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

797
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a really,</v>

798
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.030
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a ball,</v>

799
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.150
<v Speaker 1>was a really clear reminder of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that most of the planet is super heated </v>

800
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:37.611
<v Speaker 1>lava and magma and where it's so hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the rock is liquid and plastic </v>

801
00:37:37.611 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 1>right then and we just live on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little chilled crust like,</v>

802
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.130
<v Speaker 1>like the top of a porridge pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 1>and we just live on this little thin bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top that is crossed.</v>

804
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And when you tip it the other way around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look up half of the atmosphere is in</v>

805
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 1>the first three miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three miles,</v>

806
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:59.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about why people go for a three </v>

807
00:37:59.811 --> 00:37:59.811
<v Speaker 1>mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

808
00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 1>that and half really the whole habitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere is three miles above 15,000</v>

809
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to even live.</v>

810
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And we live in beats on this little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cooled crust and this little sliver </v>

811
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 1>of air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we think it's guaranteed.</v>

812
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 1>We think we think we're invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

813
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:17.040
<v Speaker 1>And we think the whole universe is here </v>
<v Speaker 1>to serve us and we're like,</v>

814
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.690
<v Speaker 1>we're like bacteria in a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.370
<v Speaker 1>just just found a little niche that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>support our life.</v>

816
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.580
<v Speaker 1>So much so that we're willing to almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>our entire system as far as energy is </v>

817
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:30.820
<v Speaker 1>based on burning thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

818
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing few talk about a hundred years</v>

819
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:36.400
<v Speaker 1>from now looking back and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were we thinking?</v>

820
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golly,</v>

821
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:42.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can see why a five gallon </v>
<v Speaker 1>pail of gasoline is an amazingly </v>

822
00:38:42.481 --> 00:38:47.310
<v Speaker 1>enabling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stick it in your car and drive </v>

823
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.310
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

824
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can carry it in your hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly stable.</v>

825
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a very seductive fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it has such </v>

826
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we look,</v>

827
00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.110
<v Speaker 1>when we figure out the next energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>

828
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>when we look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully in a couple of hundred</v>

829
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.260
<v Speaker 2>years we will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were we thinking?</v>

830
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

831
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see the.</v>

832
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard for people to change to</v>
<v Speaker 2>once once we have a pattern that we </v>

833
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.960
<v Speaker 2>follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult,</v>

834
00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:17.961
<v Speaker 2>especially if we found a way to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>work for ourselves in spite of all the </v>

835
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.610
<v Speaker 2>pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still rock it that way.</v>

836
00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:23.430
<v Speaker 2>In spite of all the stuff that we throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the ocean.</v>

837
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.820
<v Speaker 2>We still kind of happening basically on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a daily basis.</v>

838
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

839
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Once you built a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to change of course,</v>

840
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.570
<v Speaker 2>and you can't just suddenly start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions of people are killed,</v>

841
00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:36.000
<v Speaker 2>millions of people just because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to change energy sources.</v>

842
00:39:36.001 --> 00:39:39.690
<v Speaker 2>It has to be gradual and we will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaned off fossil fuels,</v>

843
00:39:39.691 --> 00:39:44.691
<v Speaker 2>but they got to get a lot more scarce </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we're going to bother just </v>

844
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:44.691
<v Speaker 2>because of its human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will.</v>

845
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:47.010
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate use of fossil fuels is a g </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a rocket.</v>

846
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the ultimate display of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

847
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Shooting into space with a giant plume </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fire behind you.</v>

848
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a brute force way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

849
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.230
<v Speaker 2>We're burning dinosaurs to get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

850
00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:03.231
<v Speaker 2>but it's so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way we figured out how so </v>

851
00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:03.231
<v Speaker 2>far it's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you,</v>

852
00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you think about like what's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future when they start talking about</v>

853
00:40:06.721 --> 00:40:09.870
<v Speaker 2>all these different propulsion methods </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will someday be available.</v>

854
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.870
<v Speaker 2>What if any of them appear viable?</v>

855
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking me to predict physics,</v>

856
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inventions of the future,</v>

857
00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:20.270
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

858
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go,</v>

859
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd do it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

860
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

861
00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.940
<v Speaker 1>to me the obvious answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

862
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 1>every single molecule that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every complex molecule and Adam was put </v>

863
00:40:34.551 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 1>together in a blast furnace of a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>with almost unlimited heat and pressure,</v>

864
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 1>which is the center of a son and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored that energy in every single atom </v>

865
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:50.051
<v Speaker 1>and molecule that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have yet to find a good way to </v>

866
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:52.940
<v Speaker 1>get that energy back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is more energy and a pencil.</v>

867
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

868
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.710
<v Speaker 1>if you could truly get the energy that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside all of the molecules that are in </v>

869
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.710
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

870
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.230
<v Speaker 1>there's so much energy stored there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:41:00.231 --> 00:41:03.530
<v Speaker 1>we have like wood that stored sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

872
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:06.410
<v Speaker 1>And we by burning it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can release that stored solar power,</v>

873
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 1>even nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we haven't found a clean way to </v>

874
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.150
<v Speaker 1>release the energy to gives us nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

875
00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:15.650
<v Speaker 1>We can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're still,</v>

876
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of cave men about it and we </v>

877
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.441
<v Speaker 1>haven't got a clean way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm certain that at some point we </v>

878
00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 1>will figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it will be cold fusion or,</v>

879
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:30.661
<v Speaker 1>or just fusion itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you read what they're doing in </v>

880
00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 1>the various laboratories around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

881
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 1>even the experts think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

882
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>we're probably years away</v>

883
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from being able to contain fusion so </v>

884
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:38.980
<v Speaker 2>that it becomes a net positive power </v>
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>

885
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

886
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.100
<v Speaker 2>when the experts are saying it's 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years until we can do it,</v>

887
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:43.920
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

888
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.940
<v Speaker 2>There was a recent article in one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>science magazines that the volume of </v>

889
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:55.181
<v Speaker 2>nuclear waste could be reduced by 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent that they've shown that they can</v>

890
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:57.970
<v Speaker 2>mix plutonium contaminated waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

891
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.040
<v Speaker 2>with blast furnace slag and turn it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>glass and it reduces its volume by 85 to</v>

892
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:09.431
<v Speaker 2>95 percent and effectively locks in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radioactive plutonium creating a stable </v>

893
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 2>end products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like,</v>

894
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

895
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear waste thing is a huge issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

896
00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:21.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done a lot of weird things like </v>

897
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:21.911
<v Speaker 2>dig holes in the ground and buried in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

898
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:25.361
<v Speaker 2>And Nevada and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's going on now in Fukushima is </v>

899
00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:25.361
<v Speaker 2>very disturbing.</v>

900
00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain it.</v>

901
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming up with all these different ways,</v>

902
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fascinating thing about human</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

903
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:35.771
<v Speaker 2>If their backs are up against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those crazy monkeys figuring out a way </v>

904
00:42:35.771 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 2>to fix things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's just our nature and necessity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the main mother and we need to.</v>

906
00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we don't think we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessity.</v>

907
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And nuclear waste is a big problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuel waste is a huge problem as </v>

908
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And neither of them are perfect.</v>

909
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Even solar energy has waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

910
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 2>because of you have to build all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solar panels and you have to collect all</v>

911
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 2>the rare earth metals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of it's for free.</v>

912
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.660
<v Speaker 2>We have to find as best to trade off as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can and,</v>

913
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:04.661
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still be able to try and sustain as </v>

914
00:43:04.661 --> 00:43:05.720
<v Speaker 2>good as standard of living for as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around the planet as possible.</v>

915
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.800
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've done we,</v>

916
00:43:08.801 --> 00:43:13.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we feed more people now than we ever </v>

917
00:43:13.801 --> 00:43:13.801
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

918
00:43:13.801 --> 00:43:13.801
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how,</v>

919
00:43:13.801 --> 00:43:14.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we do it in the future?</v>

920
00:43:14.841 --> 00:43:16.960
<v Speaker 2>How do we get better at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure he,</v>

921
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 2>there's so many variables obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

922
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

923
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm always very excited when I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this that has like,</v>

924
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.100
<v Speaker 2>oh my faith in the crazy humans has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>restored like these,</v>

925
00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:33.310
<v Speaker 2>these nuts have figured out a way to fix</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue or at least reducing issue </v>

926
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.940
<v Speaker 2>significantly by as much as 90 plus </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

927
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

928
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fossil fuel thing to me is a,</v>

929
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:43.370
<v Speaker 2>is a weird one because obviously I enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

930
00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:48.371
<v Speaker 2>we use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important for almost everything </v>

931
00:43:48.371 --> 00:43:50.321
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously this is going to create a </v>

932
00:43:50.321 --> 00:43:52.361
<v Speaker 2>problem some day and there's no better </v>
<v Speaker 2>example for that for me than the </v>

933
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 2>automobile pollution or pollution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get from jet airplanes,</v>

934
00:43:57.021 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis.</v>

935
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.880
<v Speaker 2>How much it means there's a big impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the environment.</v>

936
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Every time the space shuttle gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched,</v>

937
00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 2>isn't it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

938
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 2>compared to everything else it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

939
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and of course space shuttle is retired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we only flew the special at 135 </v>

940
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:12.250
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

941
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.090
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't even measure compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>

942
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:19.091
<v Speaker 2>the pollution that it injected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it had gotten to the point where it </v>

943
00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:19.091
<v Speaker 2>was like Arab travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

944
00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Well you wouldn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

945
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 2>thousands of those launch and everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't a possibility.</v>

947
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was going to do.</v>

948
00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.000
<v Speaker 2>But compare it to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 2>how we burn coal to generate electricity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how we use to transport ourselves</v>

950
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.890
<v Speaker 1>around the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

951
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 40,</v>

952
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42,000</v>

953
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 1>people a year killed just in car </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashes,</v>

954
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>

955
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a societal norm in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

956
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 1>We expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say that's okay.</v>

957
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.970
<v Speaker 1>It's all right to kill 42,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

958
00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So we have the freedom to drive our cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>around wherever we want.</v>

959
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Kind of an interesting level of accepted</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disaster,</v>

960
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just say that's okay.</v>

961
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:01.791
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not some global warming problem </v>

962
00:45:01.791 --> 00:45:01.791
<v Speaker 1>that may manifest itself on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

963
00:45:01.791 --> 00:45:04.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a guaranteed thing this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

964
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

965
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 1>just an interesting thing to hold up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and look at yourself and say,</v>

966
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

967
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what we decide is alright,</v>

968
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:17.110
<v Speaker 2>who's also a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a very statistically significant </v>

969
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.831
<v Speaker 2>number of years of your life that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose by living in a small filled </v>

970
00:45:20.831 --> 00:45:21.320
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>

971
00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't think about that because </v>

972
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 2>you can survive and be healthy in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York City,</v>

973
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go jogging down the streets of </v>

974
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink spring water and think </v>

975
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.570
<v Speaker 2>everything's all groovy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is if you're living in a</v>

976
00:45:32.571 --> 00:45:35.210
<v Speaker 2>city and you're breathing in those fumes</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis,</v>

977
00:45:35.211 --> 00:45:37.520
<v Speaker 2>it will reduce your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>

978
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

980
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of us are lasting forever and </v>

981
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>people live where they want to live for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the reasons.</v>

982
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 1>And only one of the variables is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many years are you going to live there?</v>

983
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather live in the middle of </v>

984
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.620
<v Speaker 2>nowhere where the air is clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no people to talk to or in </v>

985
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.560
<v Speaker 2>the theater is really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theater is always bad.</v>

986
00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the best theater or even nearly </v>

987
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.380
<v Speaker 2>as good as the best movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close,</v>

988
00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.840
<v Speaker 2>antiquated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goofy art form.</v>

989
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask you about these guys.</v>

990
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aliens.</v>

991
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 2>That little alien guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

992
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.370
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're up there,</v>

993
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.270
<v Speaker 2>when you're in space,</v>

994
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

995
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:26.610
<v Speaker 2>do you ponder the possibility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that something that you ever </v>

996
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.091
<v Speaker 2>wonder yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there intelligent life forms out </v>

997
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:30.091
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if so,</v>

998
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:32.020
<v Speaker 2>do you think that they watch us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they're aware of us?</v>

999
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:36.770
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned earlier that with Galileo </v>
<v Speaker 1>inventing the telescope,</v>

1000
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was tortured for pointing out that we</v>

1001
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:46.751
<v Speaker 1>weren't the center of the universe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with every invention that's come </v>

1002
00:46:47.241 --> 00:46:52.241
<v Speaker 1>since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been able to prove more and more </v>

1003
00:46:52.241 --> 00:46:54.131
<v Speaker 1>conclusively just how far from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center of the universe we are and also </v>

1004
00:46:54.131 --> 00:46:56.380
<v Speaker 1>how huge the university is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And billions of years old and,</v>

1005
00:46:56.381 --> 00:46:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and more vast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are so big,</v>

1006
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:02.030
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're incomprehensible both in numbers</v>

1007
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.820
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stars and number of galaxies.</v>

1008
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And within the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the great-great-grandchildren of,</v>

1009
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.920
<v Speaker 1>of Galileo's telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are seeing planets directly,</v>

1010
00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:16.490
<v Speaker 1>seeing planets around nearby stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen thousands of them.</v>

1011
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:21.010
<v Speaker 1>So we've basically shown that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single star has planets.</v>

1012
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an unlimited number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets out there.</v>

1013
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And so to think that with an unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of that,</v>

1014
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:34.501
<v Speaker 1>we are the only life in the universe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is just a natural extension of </v>

1015
00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 1>thinking that we're the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1016
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an arrogance,</v>

1017
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.490
<v Speaker 1>egotism thing was based on belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of fact.</v>

1018
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think arrogant and egotistical to </v>

1019
00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.510
<v Speaker 1>think that were so fascinating and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so revelation area and,</v>

1020
00:47:47.511 --> 00:47:52.511
<v Speaker 1>and so special that somehow a weird big </v>
<v Speaker 1>black eyed monsters with no hair on </v>

1021
00:47:53.651 --> 00:47:58.651
<v Speaker 1>their bodies are sneaking around staring</v>
<v Speaker 1>at us because we are so special.</v>

1022
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:04.681
<v Speaker 1>To me that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fun science fiction and it </v>

1023
00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:05.970
<v Speaker 1>makes for great entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1024
00:48:05.971 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>

1025
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that the archetype of the,</v>

1026
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alien with the large black eyes and </v>

1027
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1028
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:19.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strange big head that what it may </v>

1029
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.521
<v Speaker 2>very well come from is that the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth experience for children the first </v>

1030
00:48:22.521 --> 00:48:26.661
<v Speaker 2>time the eyes are outside of the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have clear vision and they </v>

1031
00:48:26.661 --> 00:48:28.260
<v Speaker 2>see the bright light of the operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

1032
00:48:28.261 --> 00:48:30.630
<v Speaker 2>which is the first time they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>been exposed to something like that.</v>

1033
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's an incredibly traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1034
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.660
<v Speaker 2>They recognize the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are enormous in front of the head,</v>

1035
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.940
<v Speaker 2>the face with a white mask on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feature lists interesting.</v>

1036
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.990
<v Speaker 2>And that this is most likely what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype of the experience,</v>

1037
00:48:45.991 --> 00:48:46.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1038
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.880
<v Speaker 2>the medical experiments that supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>go on with these aliens,</v>

1039
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.440
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the origin of it.</v>

1040
00:48:52.441 --> 00:48:53.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1041
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.150
<v Speaker 2>we have this very arrogant idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>children don't remember things,</v>

1042
00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:57.990
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1043
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's been my point about </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumcision I,</v>

1044
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think circumcision is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1045
00:49:03.601 --> 00:49:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's antiquated.</v>

1046
00:49:05.851 --> 00:49:10.851
<v Speaker 2>It's Jen genital torture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the justification is one of </v>

1047
00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:11.310
<v Speaker 2>them is that the baby doesn't remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1048
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:16.850
<v Speaker 2>And I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know the baby doesn't </v>

1049
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:16.850
<v Speaker 2>remember just because they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>point of reference or context.</v>

1050
00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible they remember it </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1051
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:23.180
<v Speaker 2>The scientific answer to the alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>abduction experience and these cold hard</v>

1052
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:28.970
<v Speaker 2>medical examinations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionless medical examinations may </v>

1053
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.100
<v Speaker 2>very well just be the birthing process </v>
<v Speaker 2>or some of it will search both.</v>

1054
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1055
00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:38.391
<v Speaker 2>the incredible feeling of helplessness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have is basically their body </v>

1056
00:49:38.391 --> 00:49:41.940
<v Speaker 2>doesn't move yet and that these intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>memories are burned deep,</v>

1057
00:49:41.941 --> 00:49:43.320
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep into our consciousness.</v>

1058
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it also just comes from a fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being alone and a fear of being </v>

1059
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 1>mortal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we can somehow convince ourselves</v>

1060
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that neither of those two things are </v>

1061
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.431
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a great comfort to folks and </v>

1062
00:49:58.431 --> 00:49:58.890
<v Speaker 1>to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's other life out there.</v>

1063
00:49:58.891 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1064
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1065
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:05.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's holding us as super special and </v>

1066
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.390
<v Speaker 1>it's been here before and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be back.</v>

1067
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice seductive thought process to</v>

1068
00:50:06.631 --> 00:50:07.770
<v Speaker 1>go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1069
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.040
<v Speaker 1>but there is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1070
00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.280
<v Speaker 1>we have left Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have 13 years ago this month,</v>

1071
00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:19.281
<v Speaker 1>we permanently started living on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space station with the International </v>

1072
00:50:19.281 --> 00:50:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Space Station program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Soviets had been there for </v>

1073
00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.621
<v Speaker 1>decades before on their space stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have sent probes to every planet in </v>

1074
00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the solar system and got one going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Pluto right now.</v>

1075
00:50:26.521 --> 00:50:30.170
<v Speaker 1>And we're rovers on a couple different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different planets and moons in the</v>

1076
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1077
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:37.840
<v Speaker 1>if aliens did show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think their behavior would be </v>

1078
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 1>the one that is in the common science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction media,</v>

1079
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't make sense.</v>

1080
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

1081
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:47.831
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am convinced there's life in the </v>

1082
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:47.831
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:47.831
<v Speaker 1>just starting the statistics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes sense.</v>

1084
00:50:47.831 --> 00:50:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1085
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:53.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just egotism to think that we're </v>

1086
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.261
<v Speaker 1>that special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's also just egotism to </v>

1087
00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:58.631
<v Speaker 1>think that we're so special that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the object of great secretive </v>

1088
00:50:58.631 --> 00:50:58.631
<v Speaker 1>fascination by higher beings.</v>

1089
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're very humble and so you </v>

1090
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 2>look at us and say that it wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that interesting,</v>

1091
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>but I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if we found out that there was a</v>

1092
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:10.050
<v Speaker 2>planet just outside of our solar system </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there were some people that were,</v>

1093
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.270
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just like human beings,</v>

1094
00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.000
<v Speaker 2>but they will like human beings from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 hundreds.</v>

1095
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just hadn't figured anything out </v>

1096
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would be like,</v>

1097
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have guns.</v>

1098
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.920
<v Speaker 2>They figured out the wheel that lighten </v>
<v Speaker 2>their city's on fire.</v>

1099
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 2>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just haven't figured out mass </v>

1100
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 2>communication yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of them can't read.</v>

1101
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I think we would be as a lot like us </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1102
00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.130
<v Speaker 2>It's just a lot like us right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really haven't changed that much.</v>

1103
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.520
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if we found some people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a thousand years ago,</v>

1104
00:51:35.521 --> 00:51:40.521
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years in our past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would be absolutely incredibly </v>

1105
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:40.521
<v Speaker 2>fascinated.</v>

1106
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I think if we found some being somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had harnessed the power of fire,</v>

1107
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.050
<v Speaker 2>and if we went back 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

1108
00:51:46.051 --> 00:51:47.790
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd find it incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

1109
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.390
<v Speaker 2>So the stuff that we can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it.</v>

1110
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 2>I think if I was an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be so fascinated by these </v>

1111
00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.931
<v Speaker 2>freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pink monkeys with bank sticks and </v>

1112
00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:02.481
<v Speaker 2>the Internet and religions and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak show stuff that we have down here </v>

1113
00:52:02.481 --> 00:52:07.461
<v Speaker 2>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we would be the most wonderful </v>

1114
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.220
<v Speaker 2>freak show of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often said that if there is,</v>

1115
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.790
<v Speaker 2>if there is intelligent life in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth that I think are outside of earth,</v>

1116
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that earth is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiawana of outer space.</v>

1117
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Which explains why all visitations come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the night,</v>

1118
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:23.650
<v Speaker 2>that they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hammered and they want to see a </v>

1119
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:23.650
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to go see the freak show.</v>

1120
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I think if I was an intelligent being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not buy the idea what would be so </v>

1121
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.020
<v Speaker 2>special about human beings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do we start?</v>

1122
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot special about this crazy </v>

1123
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:36.960
<v Speaker 2>species above all other species on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

1124
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.030
<v Speaker 2>There's 7 billion of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1125
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:44.031
<v Speaker 2>They're like rats on a sinking ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They inhabit every little spot in the </v>

1126
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:44.280
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a little floating thing.</v>

1127
00:52:44.281 --> 00:52:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Poking out of the ocean were some plants</v>
<v Speaker 2>are growing on it.</v>

1128
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Boom is a whole whole sea of people live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

1129
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Hawaii,</v>

1130
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:54.600
<v Speaker 2>this little tiny spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a million people in Hawaii who were</v>

1131
00:52:54.601 --> 00:52:59.100
<v Speaker 2>crazy and I think I would look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got to go there and we got to</v>

1132
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:04.101
<v Speaker 2>go to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we would be probably one of the </v>

1133
00:53:04.101 --> 00:53:05.490
<v Speaker 2>most fascinating things to observe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're so incredibly advanced and</v>

1134
00:53:05.491 --> 00:53:09.480
<v Speaker 2>yet so contradictive so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hypocritical,</v>

1135
00:53:09.481 --> 00:53:11.940
<v Speaker 2>so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so easily led,</v>

1136
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.710
<v Speaker 2>so easily tricked and fooled.</v>

1137
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.820
<v Speaker 2>We have access to instant information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet we choose to believe some of the</v>

1138
00:53:17.821 --> 00:53:19.800
<v Speaker 2>most ridiculous things of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1139
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you though that I find the </v>

1140
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 2>evidence of us context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but aliens,</v>

1141
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>incredibly uncompelling and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I talked to,</v>

1142
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:34.521
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a Scifi show called Joe Rogan </v>

1143
00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:37.011
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything where I met with a lot of </v>

1144
00:53:37.011 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 2>these Ufo guys and I felt like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to religious fanatics.</v>

1145
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like talking to a religious </v>

1146
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:44.871
<v Speaker 2>fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just they feel like they're too </v>

1147
00:53:44.871 --> 00:53:46.311
<v Speaker 2>clever for the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they fall for the blue book project.</v>

1148
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Blue Book is their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their Lord.</v>

1149
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 2>So two weeks ago a satire paper in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada published a thing about what I </v>

1150
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 2>did at a movie theater watching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie gravity and they said,</v>

1151
00:53:55.921 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I heckled it and I've heard about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I farted to protest the movie.</v>

1152
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.610
<v Speaker 2>You did all this stuff and got thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the theater.</v>

1153
00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.190
<v Speaker 2>That's really rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very funny.</v>

1154
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Read this article.</v>

1155
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of people believed it and sent</v>
<v Speaker 2>notes and send it to their friends and </v>

1156
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1157
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1158
00:54:12.121 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1159
00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:17.601
<v Speaker 2>this must be the truth because I believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and that thinking is so easily </v>

1160
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:23.301
<v Speaker 2>prevalent and dominates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>populist conclusion making when in fact </v>

1161
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not based on fact at all because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to believe stuff,</v>

1162
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:32.240
<v Speaker 2>but they don't want to spend any time </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doing the thinking or the </v>

1163
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.240
<v Speaker 2>research about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1164
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1165
00:54:33.421 --> 00:54:35.610
<v Speaker 2>that that's pervasive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right across all cultures,</v>

1166
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:37.550
<v Speaker 2>including what people think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 2>alien abduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:44.100
<v Speaker 2>That was also a real problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to information right now.</v>

1169
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:49.101
<v Speaker 2>So beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can get information at anytime </v>

1170
00:54:49.101 --> 00:54:49.101
<v Speaker 2>but it's not vetted.</v>

1171
00:54:49.101 --> 00:54:50.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a lot of what they call</v>

1172
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 2>satire sites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are just not satire.</v>

1173
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 2>They just lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1174
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1175
00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 2>there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this one national news something</v>

1176
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:02.601
<v Speaker 2>or another website that people keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly tweeting me stories from and </v>

1177
00:55:02.601 --> 00:55:04.420
<v Speaker 2>they just make up stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one about that,</v>

1178
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I retweeted before I read where it came </v>

1179
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:11.511
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Texas decided to use sexual </v>

1180
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:12.770
<v Speaker 2>predators for medical experiments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1181
00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lie.</v>

1182
00:55:14.341 --> 00:55:19.341
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you read the onion within </v>

1183
00:55:19.341 --> 00:55:19.341
<v Speaker 2>five minutes or five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize,</v>

1184
00:55:19.341 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing comedy.</v>

1185
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.880
<v Speaker 2>This is funny business humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1186
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:27.890
<v Speaker 2>they're not being humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just lying and they're calling it </v>

1187
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.960
<v Speaker 2>satire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see that attributed to you like</v>

1188
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 2>farting in a movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's rude.</v>

1189
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 2>And I've read it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had it sent to me like,</v>

1190
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 2>this guy's an asshole.</v>

1191
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Like he farted in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made me laugh,</v>

1192
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 2>but the reaction to it made me laugh as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1193
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on people please,</v>

1194
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1195
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:48.231
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are actually sell separate from the </v>

1196
00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 2>one celled organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have brains and reason and experience</v>

1197
00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:54.030
<v Speaker 2>in logic and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're clearly still developing clearly.</v>

1198
00:55:54.031 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's both and everybody.</v>

1199
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.030
<v Speaker 2>This folks like you that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced technology and innovation at</v>

1200
00:56:01.031 --> 00:56:02.420
<v Speaker 2>its very height,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1201
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1202
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the highest highs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've actually gone out above the,</v>

1203
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 2>the actual atmosphere of our earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've experienced the amount of </v>

1204
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>technological sophistication that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes to pull something like that off.</v>

1205
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 2>But then there's other folks that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely there,</v>

1206
00:56:18.151 --> 00:56:23.151
<v Speaker 2>chimps with a language and they exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst us because of this complex </v>

1207
00:56:23.151 --> 00:56:26.901
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it really for people to just </v>

1208
00:56:26.901 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 2>get by and breed and make more dumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1209
00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy.</v>

1210
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to have that,</v>

1211
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the Yin and the Yang of life?</v>

1212
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I think the real key to it is what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody want to get out of it?</v>

1214
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to get out of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what do you,</v>

1215
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:46.640
<v Speaker 1>what do you find is your own compulsion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1216
00:56:46.641 --> 00:56:51.641
<v Speaker 1>what is it that that gives you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction at the end of the day and </v>

1217
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:55.111
<v Speaker 1>it may be that stuff you've read on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet or maybe the television show </v>

1218
00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 1>that you watch or maybe the sports team </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you idolize,</v>

1219
00:56:55.871 --> 00:57:00.871
<v Speaker 1>read maybe some new invention somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>or some area or your huge belief into </v>

1220
00:57:00.871 --> 00:57:02.890
<v Speaker 1>some particular subset of what we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>or we don't know.</v>

1221
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should be doing that.</v>

1222
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So long as they're pushing themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they're interested in.</v>

1223
00:57:09.701 --> 00:57:14.701
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get the best out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that they're naturally </v>

1224
00:57:14.701 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 1>inclined towards and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make the most of it.</v>

1225
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just been what I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just interested in this particular </v>

1226
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:25.111
<v Speaker 1>part of space flight and a and m case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was fine by me live and let live,</v>

1227
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but don't spend all of those efforts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking your particular set of interests </v>

1228
00:57:32.291 --> 00:57:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and your beliefs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have given you this area and trying</v>

1229
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 1>to force them on other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make them good for you.</v>

1230
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Offering them up for other people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe if they like,</v>

1231
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1232
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't try.</v>

1233
00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:48.871
<v Speaker 1>And convince everybody else in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're a Ufo is just because this </v>

1234
00:57:48.871 --> 00:57:48.871
<v Speaker 1>is what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

1235
00:57:48.871 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Why would that become your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1236
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mantra?</v>

1237
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be so important?</v>

1238
00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just like people that want </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to convert to Islam,</v>

1239
00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 2>they just have this idea in their head </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the truth and they have to </v>

1240
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 2>pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a religion.</v>

1241
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that the religion of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1242
00:58:05.571 --> 00:58:05.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1243
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:06.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1244
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity of ideology.</v>

1245
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Once you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that want you to be on a t</v>

1246
00:58:11.961 --> 00:58:14.220
<v Speaker 2>and t because that's their network know </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1247
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to do with verizon and at and</v>

1248
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:21.480
<v Speaker 2>t there's a weird clan thing that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings have and blackberry versus ipad </v>

1249
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:24.590
<v Speaker 2>and the people that believe in aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all stick together.</v>

1250
00:58:24.591 --> 00:58:27.680
<v Speaker 2>They go and they have conferences and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a part of their culture.</v>

1251
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:30.230
<v Speaker 2>It's fun and there's this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1252
00:58:30.231 --> 00:58:35.231
<v Speaker 2>this confirmation bias where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to look at anything outside of </v>

1253
00:58:35.231 --> 00:58:39.010
<v Speaker 2>something that confirmed their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to look at it </v>

1254
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:42.281
<v Speaker 2>objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think having a belief system is </v>

1255
00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:42.350
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see anything up there?</v>

1256
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Anything Weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No lights</v>

1257
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 1>world is really weird to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to look at in the </v>

1258
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 1>storms around the planet and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the uh,</v>

1259
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I was out on a spacewalk going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern lights,</v>

1260
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1261

<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>

1262
00:58:58.221 --> 00:59:03.221
<v Speaker 1>Aurora Australis coming up underneath my</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet for a thousand miles and that is a </v>

1263
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>weird thing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

1264
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:06.570
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

1265
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't green real it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what you see in pictures is green</v>

1266
00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:13.340
<v Speaker 1>because that's what the cameras see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality it's,</v>

1267
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.380
<v Speaker 1>it's got red and orange and yellow </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out the top of it so that your </v>

1268
00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.460
<v Speaker 1>eyes can pick up and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1269
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how could this possibly be earth?</v>

1270
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.420
<v Speaker 1>How can this be going on all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1271
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it is phenomenal to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you can see for several </v>

1272
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.100
<v Speaker 1>thousand miles and it's under your feet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and say hi.</v>
