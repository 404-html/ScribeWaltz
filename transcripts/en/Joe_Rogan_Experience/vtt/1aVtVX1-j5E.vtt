00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy,</v>

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.200

<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

21
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.200

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>like batmobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like weird toy.</v>

23
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It looks like you shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive in the street.</v>

24
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

25
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>how do you.</v>

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You could just drive that around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quitting.</v>

27
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Know how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

28
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>is that a car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

29
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but technically it's considered a </v>

30
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

31
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the helmet,</v>

32
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I wear the helmet sometimes kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening,</v>

33
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>definitely wear a helmet when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

34
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.333
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I parked at the airport because I don't </v>

35
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:25.321
<v Speaker 1>want to park my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a porsche parked at the airport and then</v>

36
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I have time to go home because</v>

37
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.384
<v Speaker 1>I land this morning from San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have time to go home and change </v>

38
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>the cards out and then come here and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

39
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.061
<v Speaker 1>take a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

40
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

41
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:36.851
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

42
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I just struggle all the way down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on the four or five over the hill.</v>

43
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely though.</v>

44
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.483
<v Speaker 1>The wind in my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got fucking eighties rock on this </v>

45
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling myself,</v>

46
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought did.</v>

47
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.163
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's either the coolest guy I've </v>

48
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest tool.</v>

49
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like it hit me with your best shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking flying man.</v>

50
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.533
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You listening to Pat Benatar just wowed </v>

51
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it man.</v>

52
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never get on a motorcycle,</v>

53
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but because this thing is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little safer,</v>

54
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>a little little sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because people can see it,</v>

55
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Speaker 1>like most likely get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't see it.</v>

56
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this thing,</v>

57
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean when to my face I can see like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything meant like a car.</v>

58
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>You're sewing clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I love it.</v>

59
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>And the stick shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like I'm one with the road.</v>

60
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

61
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>

62
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't driving,</v>

63
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel.</v>

64
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel more like I said with the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

65
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Paul Newman or some shit,</v>

66
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.493
<v Speaker 1>like a race car driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with that thing that seems </v>

67
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>like the sweet spot between a motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a car.</v>

68
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it makes sense.</v>

69
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:53.810
<v Speaker 1>And the gas mileage on it is super </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

70
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably weighs nothing right now.</v>

71
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Thing little engine in its fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if your ways.</v>

72
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Can</v>

73
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>you pick it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

74
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>We should try after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I pick it up?</v>

75
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>You and I can definitely pick it up if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it weighs somewhere around like,</v>

76
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>like a really light light car is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be the most fun to drive,</v>

77
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say like a 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>73 porsche because they're not,</v>

78
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>they're not that powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really need to be 1973.</v>

79
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Porsche has like 200 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

80
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:21.844
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fast little car because they </v>

81
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>way you can get them down to like 1900 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

82
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might.</v>

83
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.030
<v Speaker 2>My Gt three is 3000 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so think of nuts.</v>

84
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>So severity light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

85
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>That's why when you're buying a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get the Targa,</v>

86
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 2>there's so much heavier glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're heavy,</v>

87
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.453
<v Speaker 2>heaviest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

88
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>All that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look sick though.</v>

89
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 2>They do look cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they are.</v>

90
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Especially the old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're the most rigid.</v>

91
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they had that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to have an NSX that had a </v>

92
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>target top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you got to your 1700 years at?</v>

93
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 2>You were saying Porsche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

94
00:03:59.141 --> 00:03:59.974
<v Speaker 2>that's light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lighter than probably one of the </v>

95
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 2>lightest cars you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the stickler,</v>

96
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>no airbags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if someone were to hit me,</v>

97
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 2>that's no Bueno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live life on the edge though,</v>

98
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.850
<v Speaker 2>fellas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

99
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>She can do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like having no airbags.</v>

100
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

101
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:17.434
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's considered a motorcycle on the </v>

102
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say cops.</v>

103
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:21.484
<v Speaker 2>If they see you that a helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will pull you over and pound the </v>

104
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

105
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.073
<v Speaker 2>These things are so new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think I'm like some low budget </v>

106
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 2>alley cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Wayne or something like that.</v>

107
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.850
<v Speaker 2>They thumbs up past seven of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you don't have a helmet on.</v>

108
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go in Carpool.</v>

109
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I go in Carpool like an asshole just </v>
<v Speaker 2>blaring eighties rockaway.</v>

110
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 2>A carpool because it's a motorcycle.</v>

111
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well classically it's a motorcycle.</v>

112
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.393
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

113
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 2>You could go into the Hov in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>

114
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really no rules.</v>

115
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of no man's land right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can.</v>

116
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How funny is that?</v>

117
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to go in the Carpool lane</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a fucking motorcycle.</v>

118
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the opposite of carpooling in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's so stupid,</v>

119
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 2>like if you're carpooling on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle,</v>

120
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>you putting somebody at risk corral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get somebody on the back with you</v>

121
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I see a guy on a motorcycle,</v>

122
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I see one person I see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's dangerous,</v>

123
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's gotten worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see two people on a motorcycle.</v>

124
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is.</v>

125
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.083
<v Speaker 2>This is like exponentially more </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and usually it's his girl in </v>

126
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>the back with like she is daisy dukes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

127
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much,</v>

128
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 2>how good are you at adjusting with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>extra 125 pounds in the back.</v>

129
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

130
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 2>That extra hundred 25 pounds or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>she weighed one.</v>

131
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Let's go one for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make a real woman.</v>

132
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's say she's a hundred 50 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you get to 150 pounds behind you,</v>

133
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>how good are you at correcting for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really practice that,</v>

134
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 2>are you good in the moment when the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits the fan?</v>

135
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you make good decisions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you even know if you do?</v>

136
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.463
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you're both on a </v>

137
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:50.434
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle and you have daisy dukes on </v>
<v Speaker 2>craft gives off fucked meat goes </v>

138
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Meaty.</v>

139
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just chunks of meat.</v>

140
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Hit the gravel</v>

141
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 3>and rip apart and tear would go barefoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shorts,</v>

142
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 3>no shirt riding a motorcycle and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that in Colorado.</v>

143
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to have a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Nevada has no helmet too.</v>

144
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona,</v>

145
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.374
<v Speaker 3>no helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw these dudes riding around and </v>

146
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Harley Davidson's no helmet and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

147
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 3>what kind of fear though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for you to ride a motorcycle,</v>

148
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to tell them where to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a helmet if they.</v>

149
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't want to wear one,</v>

150
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the only thing that could</v>

151
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 3>save their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

152
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 3>but if they're on a motorcycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

153
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:30.951
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

154
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.784
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

155
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 3>this is how I like to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

156
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an argument there,</v>

157
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.070
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

158
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.903
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he should be able to tell </v>

159
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:38.084
<v Speaker 3>people what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think guidelines for young people </v>

160
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.174
<v Speaker 3>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important because they make good </v>

161
00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive decisions and if you you could</v>

162
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 3>protect more of them.</v>

163
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.423
<v Speaker 3>If you made a mandatory helmet law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should say up to age 30 and </v>

164
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:51.674
<v Speaker 3>over age 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it over the fucking why they do </v>

165
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 3>it because you can't have all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>loopholes.</v>

166
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

167
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 3>probably makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason why they do it,</v>

168
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>it's for insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think insurance policies don't.</v>

169
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to pay out for injuries </v>
<v Speaker 3>and death and all that shit.</v>

170
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 3>That's why they make seatbelt laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they make helmet laws.</v>

171
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think it's to protect </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

172
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 3>I think protecting people as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of protecting their money.</v>

173
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Gross is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's true though.</v>

175
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 3>That's live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they realized how people,</v>

176
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 3>how many people get injured and how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to pay.</v>

177
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 3>So they factored in and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

178
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>just lobby for more protection in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car is more airbags,</v>

179
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 3>airbags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mandatory seatbelts,</v>

180
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 3>all that different stuff.</v>

181
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of that is really under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guise of protecting us.</v>

182
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 3>It's really the protective insurance </v>
<v Speaker 3>company's money.</v>

183
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.690
<v Speaker 3>It's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

184
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

185
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.803
<v Speaker 3>your odds of getting a motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident your first year of owning a </v>

186
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle or 99 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

187
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Ninety nine percent of people get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of.</v>

188
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.143
<v Speaker 3>They wreck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do something their first year of </v>

189
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 3>driving a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

190
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 3>That's why you don't buy a super fancy </v>
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle your first year.</v>

191
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see Dean Dale reading when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he wiped?</v>

192
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wiped back when he's fat.</v>

193
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.900
<v Speaker 3>Dean Dean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

194
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 3>got off sugar completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really impressive.</v>

195
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always,</v>

196
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>it was never fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a guy who was not taking care</v>

197
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 3>of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

198
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.893
<v Speaker 3>not going to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got real thick and he was on a </v>

199
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle and some crazy meth head </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught them off.</v>

200
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Some lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might've been a stolen car.</v>

201
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 3>It was something like super sketchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

202
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>she crashed into him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wiped,</v>

203
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 3>she never stopped and he just got tow up</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of his side,</v>

204
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 3>his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his arm.</v>

205
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 3>He just got severely jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

206
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

207
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dean del Rey living life.</v>

208
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.833
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

209
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a picture of the actual wound if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could find it.</v>

210
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 3>He put up the actual wound on his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

211
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 3>especially on his back inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad.</v>

212
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean he fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

213
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to crash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be because of my error,</v>

214
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 3>not some random lady not seeing me on </v>
<v Speaker 3>meth.</v>

215
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ain't.</v>

216
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not in there.</v>

217
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a picture of it.</v>

218
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh well the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

219
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 3>all that white shit all over his side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those bandages.</v>

220
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how big the,</v>

221
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 3>the fucking giant tear is.</v>

222
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.213
<v Speaker 3>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His skin is fucked up for a good solid </v>

223
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>foot and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How funny is this?</v>

224
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 3>And so in the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBA,</v>

225
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Nhl motorcycles are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you sign that contract,</v>

226
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 3>you cannot drive a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's guys that have them,</v>

227
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 3>but legally it will void your contract </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the UFC.</v>

228
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 3>You can win a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give you motorcycles.</v>

229
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 3>That's because of the deal with Harley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

230
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 3>And Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

231
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Well they're also like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

232
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean you got to think of who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>running the UFC.</v>

233
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was owned by two guys,</v>

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Like when Oscar de la Hoya was talking </v>

316
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go to hell spec </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

317
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jones thirties facing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

318
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if he comes back at 34 and still</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks everybody,</v>

319
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but he's 260 pounds at heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all this cut and wait.</v>

320
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Just just go on a power lift and rampage</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next four years.</v>

321
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Keep your body in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still Fuck everybody up at heavyweight.</v>

322
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.713
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at that Tran of ball man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see how much per how many guys test </v>

323
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:57.970
<v Speaker 1>hot for it and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

324
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see Jones argument a little bit.</v>

325
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I know I go back and forth and I'm off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stream,</v>

326
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.583
<v Speaker 1>but when I see that and I see how big of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue it is in baseball and Minor </v>

327
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>League Baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usada and the commission might be like,</v>

328
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all these guys,</v>

329
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got real issue here.</v>

330
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.403
<v Speaker 1>Maybe did fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I think there's no way to give </v>

331
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.284
<v Speaker 1>them for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I realize now I haven't heard of </v>

332
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>anybody else tested positive for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in the UFC.</v>

333
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same stuff?</v>

334
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir test positive for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the other thing.</v>

335
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Usually if a guy tests hot for something</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of one of those major camps,</v>

336
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.623
<v Speaker 1>other guys can test hot for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff unless he's getting it straight </v>

337
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>from the power lifter guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Whereas NFL brothers didn't.</v>

339
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir eat kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those like tainted kangaroo meat,</v>

340
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Bro was at the worst argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

341
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the smartest tool in the shed.</v>

342
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Some people eat kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not common table fair in </v>

343
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

344
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.933
<v Speaker 1>fuck no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just in Australia doing the </v>

345
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.600
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The venison beef eating.</v>

346
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't say what he was flagged </v>

347
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite part,</v>

348
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:12.644
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was still given a maximum punishment </v>

349
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:15.434
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw the,</v>

350
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I think as he claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he listed numerous potential sources for</v>

351
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>the positive test including eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>kangaroo meat while in Australia.</v>

352
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>You saw it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what out of here.</v>

353
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've heard a bunch of shit,</v>

354
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's all you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy.</v>

355
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how much does it help?</v>

356
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>How much like what you think about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what these guys are doing.</v>

357
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean definitely steroids help right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids make you a better athlete.</v>

358
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.090
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to recover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 10 percent better.</v>

359
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell though,</v>

360
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:54.851
<v Speaker 1>because could John beat Daniel cormay </v>
<v Speaker 1>without that small dosage of Toronto?</v>

361
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could do.</v>

362
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what DC was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

363
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 1>the guy doesn't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's super talented.</v>

364
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

365
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

366
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why this small amount of Trento ball and</v>

367
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>you see all the other guys tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for it.</v>

368
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>How much would this really help him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he risked all this to take something</v>

369
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>piss hot and it's really not helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>

370
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And then where do we stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now we want to enlist.</v>

371
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And I had been the fucking poster boy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making fun of John on this stuff.</v>

372
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But in all seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're do.</v>

373
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:31.140
<v Speaker 1>We'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

374
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 1>most guys are doing it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this heard Luke Thomas talking about it.</v>

375
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

376
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.240
<v Speaker 1>a water right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sat in water.</v>

377
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.483
<v Speaker 1>What is the Big One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in 2007 they did this survey of </v>

379
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>athletes including fires that were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas and competing and they,</v>

380
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>they ask them at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

381
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.003
<v Speaker 1>at a kind of under the radar how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys are doing performance enhancing </v>

382
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an alarming number,</v>

383
00:16:57.921 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>like 78 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's people,</v>

384
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.973
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it would be a little higher than </v>

385
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

387
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.241
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

388
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna Tarnish John's name and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the greatest of all time,</v>

389
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

390
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 1>but then you'll pay to watch over him </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

391
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.310
<v Speaker 1>You pay to watch vitor Belfort fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:15.890
<v Speaker 1>like we don't know exactly who's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

393
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if overeem becomes a champ,</v>

394
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he pisses hot as a champ,</v>

395
00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>people turned on him to know I get it.</v>

396
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

397
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>he's tested for way worse things than </v>
<v Speaker 1>John has,</v>

398
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

399
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>we tested for testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

400
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just testosterone.</v>

401
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had elevated testosterone levels.</v>

402
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:33.854
<v Speaker 1>Bane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the same shit when he was Uber </v>

403
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more than testosterone.</v>

404
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tested positive for that,</v>

405
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said a doctor gave him a shot.</v>

406
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that like the whole deal at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor's shoulder at for?</v>

407
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I know they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

408
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>but let's just think about what they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

409
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So he tested positive for testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

410
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.813
<v Speaker 1>Well if you just pause for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you had a exemption that means </v>

411
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 1>his levels were on that feed doorbell </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Nate Marquardt Shit where they test.</v>

412
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck man,</v>

413
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 1>how are you now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the other guys.</v>

414
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.303
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the first guys pop by Usada </v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was also the one who </v>

415
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>remember he ran away.</v>

416
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to go.</v>

417
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Literally sprinted to his car that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

418
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Daniel got a big man run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 1>And then we had to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran to his car.</v>

420
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>He asked them after like a post or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>preflight pr thing.</v>

421
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

422
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 1>And then ran like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how he runs in the octagon?</v>

423
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>He was like doing that and so got away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got in his car and drove off.</v>

424
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:34.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck happened with vandelay and</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I've been to,</v>

452

<v Speaker 1>It might've been Nick Diaz,</v>

454
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.003
<v Speaker 1>but just the scolding that she was given</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fighters while this was all </v>

455
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 1>going down when they were going over </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a positive like you know,</v>

456
00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:55.550

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 1>so they feel like they have this power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

458
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a tyranny.</v>

459
00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.933
<v Speaker 1>They're not nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have a personal </v>

460
00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:02.304
<v Speaker 1>relationship with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have personal issues like </v>

461
00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:05.224
<v Speaker 1>just stern faced anger in your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in like some sort of a </v>

462
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:12.730
<v Speaker 1>competition to convict someone and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish them go thing.</v>

463
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very factual.</v>

475
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Like when he describes what a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not casting judgment,</v>

476
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>he's not being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just saying this is what we have,</v>

480
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.933
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also your realized when they brought on </v>

481
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.693
<v Speaker 1>Novitsky is day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to paint the picture to </v>

<v Speaker 1>sell it for the most money possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be taken serious.</v>

483
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So you signed this huge reebok </v>
<v Speaker 1>endorsement deal,</v>

00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to pump it and then the,</v>

486
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the and then frank and Lorenzo just sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining shares too.</v>

487
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.213
<v Speaker 1>Like we're really out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone was just telling me about how </v>

488
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:19.084
<v Speaker 1>they do that with businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some businesses are not operating </v>

489
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 1>just to try to make a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're operating to sell.</v>

490
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went why it's.</v>

491
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.623
<v Speaker 1>And then this one guy was telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his friend had a business that was </v>

492
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 1>operating that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it didn't sell,</v>

493
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:35.074
<v Speaker 1>the sell fell apart and then they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change the business plan and then </v>

494
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 1>start making it a business to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

495

<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck are you talking about</v>

<v Speaker 1>when it comes to business.</v>

497
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:47.194

<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

500

507
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.173

508
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 1>of I could just a giant sum of money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be earned.</v>

509
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:21.723
<v Speaker 1>You only look at as they earned it too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think about like where the </v>

510
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 1>business was before they came along and </v>

<v Speaker 1>let's sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to find some buyers in the morning.</v>

515
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.210

564
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:49.484

<v Speaker 3>I don't know man with Johnny Depp.</v>

579
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:32.990
<v Speaker 3>He just got too into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

580
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:33.824
<v Speaker 3>I just think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're on something that you don't </v>

581
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 3>enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing that does happen.</v>

582
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I happened to a lot of people on bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcoms that are making a ton of money.</v>

583
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 3>They just start going crazy and buying </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things because they need these</v>

584
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.470
<v Speaker 3>things to make them feel good because </v>
<v Speaker 3>their work doesn't.</v>

585
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:49.763
<v Speaker 3>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

586
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.953
<v Speaker 3>At least I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to get that new Ferrari </v>

587
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Ferrari for whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four 59.</v>

588
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:57.643
<v Speaker 3>Is that the newest one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm whatever it is on the top of the </v>

589
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 3>food and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dope ass Ferrari.</v>

590
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe you just like Ferrari's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know,</v>

591
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe you just buy a yacht maybe by this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you buy that and then you sign</v>

592
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:10.740
<v Speaker 3>a deal to do the show that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even want to do anymore,</v>

593
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 3>but you have to sign that deal now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've got a $12,000,000</v>

594
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:16.290
<v Speaker 3>mansion in Malibu overlooking the.</v>

595
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think done Johnny Depp.</v>

596
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Anyone his life go now after four house </v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

597
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might chill out on the fifth one,</v>

598
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:32.930
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really even staying the other ones.</v>

599
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 3>This is just a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one was like 10 bro.</v>

600
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 3>I think we should take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is 14.</v>

601
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 3>This is just a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that one of the things about</v>

602
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 3>a guy like Johnny Depp is</v>

603
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.383
<v Speaker 2>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know this amber heard lady </v>

604
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>who was living with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems nice enough to me.</v>

605
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Very beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matter of fact,</v>

606
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:53.154
<v Speaker 2>I read somewhere that she was like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer program said that she was the </v>

607
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 2>most beautiful person alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even make sense to me.</v>

608
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like symmetrical.</v>

609
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her eyes or something.</v>

610
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.763
<v Speaker 2>Well my computer's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thought is when she's beautiful </v>

612
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.333
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my thought is when you're a dude </v>

613
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 2>like him and you got a girl like that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

614
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

615
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.093
<v Speaker 2>you're having a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the great things to do is </v>

616
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:20.904
<v Speaker 2>probably just buy a ton of shit and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>impress this girl and just take her on </v>

617
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:27.890
<v Speaker 2>this journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal,</v>

618
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.550
<v Speaker 2>what kind of once 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how crazy he's doing.</v>

619
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't.</v>

620
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>He didn't buy 14 houses with her.</v>

621
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you only bought a few eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's going crazy.</v>

622
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 2>He's buying all kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she loves that,</v>

623
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think things just escalate.</v>

624
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.113
<v Speaker 2>Think things just escalate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiral out of control and they just get </v>

625
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.340
<v Speaker 2>you get away from yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

626
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:51.174
<v Speaker 2>you're standing on the fucking red </v>
<v Speaker 2>carpet with eyeliner on and silver </v>

627
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 2>chains and your insured is opening the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

628
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.273
<v Speaker 2>I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're acting like you're on some crazy </v>

629
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.420
<v Speaker 2>indie rock band and you're 53.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become a caricature Jack Sparrow,</v>

630
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.593
<v Speaker 2>you start dressing like the what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people want to see like the </v>

631
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 2>instead of you and you kind of forget </v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>

632
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

633
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just saying just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

634
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Jim Carey's latest interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

635
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's playing,</v>

636
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.841
<v Speaker 2>he's playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

637
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:21.660
<v Speaker 2>but he's getting ready for a character </v>
<v Speaker 2>who acts like that.</v>

638
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.020
<v Speaker 2>He's an character that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not Jim Carrey.</v>

639
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 2>He's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's also my favorite human being,</v>

640
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.194
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's playing a character in that so </v>

641
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 2>he has a new role</v>

642
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.880
<v Speaker 5>who he's playing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the guys,</v>

643
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:34.743
<v Speaker 5>he just signed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They announced yesterday signed for a </v>

644
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.163
<v Speaker 5>new show on showtime where he's playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>a comedian that's freaking out later in </v>

645
00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:40.840
<v Speaker 5>life or something like that</v>

646
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's what he's doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a part of the whole,</v>

647
00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying up here thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a producer,</v>

648
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.093
<v Speaker 2>so he's playing a character of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian who's freaking out who freaks </v>

649
00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:53.980

<v Speaker 2>Like that's a typical to that role.</v>

650
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.220
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of what he's doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was supposed to play,</v>

651
00:28:57.221 --> 00:29:02.050
<v Speaker 2>or at least there's a rumor that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to play Terence Mckenna in some</v>

652
00:29:02.051 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 2>sort of biography.</v>

<v Speaker 5>tourists turns Mckenna be great on this.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's been doing recently.</v>

658
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 5>It's a real cool little piece that </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't look recent.</v>

659
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.913
<v Speaker 5>It looks a lot younger there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this has been been prior two or </v>

00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:27.630
<v Speaker 5>three year time period that Scott made </v>

<v Speaker 3>Television man,</v>

00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 3>that's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go 100 percent cheese on.</v>

679
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't go at all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to appeal to Joe Slack,</v>

680
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 3>jaw sitting on his easy chair at home </v>

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 3>I feel like even Joe Slack jaw doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that bullshit.</v>

682
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 3>There's enough people that do and enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that will tolerate it.</v>

683
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 3>See Ratings Beg to differ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

684
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 3>they don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do still have good ratings.</v>

685
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:31.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just a tired show.</v>

686
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends what it is.</v>

687
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think about most shows like </v>
<v Speaker 3>ratings are down in general,</v>

688
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:39.160
<v Speaker 3>but look at things that are more organic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and real,</v>

689
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>bullshit producer Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to feel what opinions you should </v>

693
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:49.924
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're stuck in that model because </v>

694
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 3>they have commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're stuck in that model because they</v>

695
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:54.634
<v Speaker 3>have to those commercials that they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to interrupt their show with like </v>

696
00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 3>everything has to kind of wrap up every </v>
<v Speaker 3>few minutes.</v>

697
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.583
<v Speaker 3>How many minutes did they go without </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials on a regular intelligence </v>

698
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 3>bubble?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guppies let you play the full thing,</v>

699
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:12.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's like bubble guppies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My kids love it.</v>

700
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh my kid's obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They loved it when they were little.</v>

701
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Let's find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get on at 22 minutes,</v>

702
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 3>seven minutes or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every seven minutes.</v>

703
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Roughly every seven minutes for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcom.</v>

704
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 3>And do you think they do the same for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour show?</v>

705
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.480
<v Speaker 3>The brakes are different depending on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

706
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's like 12 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes.</v>

707
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 3>They're always going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can never get real deep.</v>

708
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.540
<v Speaker 3>What if they frontloaded it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts and does no one's gonna.</v>

709
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Watch that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's watching them anyways.</v>

710
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:39.963
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this show is brought to you </v>

711
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 3>commercial free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By then you don't get it,</v>

712
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.910
<v Speaker 3>but they still announced that every </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

713
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.783
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the way to do it or </v>

714
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:48.724
<v Speaker 3>product placement is a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't be gross product placement </v>

715
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:52.121
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

716
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:52.954
<v Speaker 3>you just can't be gross about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the team and someone is </v>

717
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 3>drinking a coke show a coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with that.</v>

718
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 3>As long as it makes sense for the scene.</v>

719
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.200
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>

720
00:32:02.201 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you're going to put stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there that doesn't belong for product</v>

721
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:07.330
<v Speaker 3>placement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's gross,</v>

722
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.850
<v Speaker 3>but if you could figure out some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's organic,</v>

723
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 3>I think that model is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hilarious like that.</v>

724
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tough,</v>

725
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 3>powerful rob lowe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dimey very handsome,</v>

726
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.233
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're going to start </v>

727
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:29.821
<v Speaker 3>gravitating towards more that realness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to smell bullshit now.</v>

728
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Joe Slack jaw sit in his arm chair </v>

729
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.340
<v Speaker 3>in rural Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry to pick on you,</v>

730
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.183
<v Speaker 3>Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to pick the state could say </v>

731
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just sitting there and he's got</v>

732
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:41.174
<v Speaker 3>his mouth open and maybe that appeals to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and maybe you'll tolerate it and </v>

733
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 3>then there's that whole spectrum in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between.</v>

734
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 3>True of people that like this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Granted she's an employee of Espn,</v>

809
00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.250
<v Speaker 3>but on her personal social media on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter,</v>

810
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.140
<v Speaker 3>she was saying he's a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

811
00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 3>He's a white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

812
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.253
<v Speaker 3>she said he's the worst president of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime and a lot of people said that </v>

813
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.000
<v Speaker 3>it's just the fact that she is a public </v>
<v Speaker 3>media figures.</v>

814
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wanted her fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is like,</v>

815
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:14.340
<v Speaker 3>it's weird outrage culture we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

816
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 3>She's entitled to Her fucking opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the thing is,</v>

817
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:17.783
<v Speaker 3>does espn want people on their network </v>
<v Speaker 3>being all political and talking about </v>

818
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.440
<v Speaker 3>shit like that on their social media?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do they have rules about that?</v>

819
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 3>Because some companies do have rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>

820
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:28.680
<v Speaker 3>whether you agree with those rules or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

821
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Some companies do have rules on what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can and can't say on social media.</v>

822
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.840
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing that I found </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

823
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Donald trump didn't talk about her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about espn.</v>

824
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a chicken shit thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

825
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a woman who works for </v>
<v Speaker 3>espn.</v>

826
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

827
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a woman that works for Espn,</v>

828
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.380
<v Speaker 3>a very specific person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not espn,</v>

829
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling lies should apologize or </v>

830
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck he wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't call her out.</v>

831
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 3>He didn't call her out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

832
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:01.623
<v Speaker 3>he's knows you can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially not now and everybody thinks </v>

833
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:04.284
<v Speaker 3>you're a white supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't pick on the black lady he picked </v>

834
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 3>on Rosie O'donnell all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

835
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 3>He'll go after everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Call him a loser girl.</v>

836
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Miss America and her little speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>slammed him too.</v>

837
00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:17.154
<v Speaker 3>She said a whole bunch of shit about him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see this gentleman is that Kirk </v>

838
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Cameron looks like Kirk Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's homeboy from survivor.</v>

839
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Who is it from survivor from survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some bachelor Bachelorette.</v>

840
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.113
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen him getting roasted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was accused of cheating on his </v>

841
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 3>girl classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

842
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Miss America,</v>

843
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 3>she said Shit about trump and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going after her necessarily.</v>

844
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 3>She's quote unquote gaining millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fans right now.</v>

845
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting is I watched a.</v>

846
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.220
<v Speaker 3>someone posted something about Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bordain.</v>

847
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain was caught by TMZ or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the airport.</v>

848
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very quick.</v>

849
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 3>Sort of silly interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked them a question,</v>

850
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 3>if you had to cook for Kim Jong Un and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

851
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 3>what would you serve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

852
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.950
<v Speaker 3>hemlock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he walks away.</v>

853
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking one line is also funny.</v>

854
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 3>He's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says a one liner and all these people</v>

855
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:10.614
<v Speaker 3>are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should he be fired from CNN for saying </v>

856
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:15.290
<v Speaker 3>that he would poison trump if he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

860
00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 3>the secret service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should investigate it.</v>

861
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.254
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you going to fire him like you </v>

862

<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>

864
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Outrage culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are getting excited</v>

865
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 2>about things being outrageous instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going,</v>

866
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 2>this weed is got me coughing instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just looking at it and going,</v>

867
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that.</v>

868
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or going well,</v>

869
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:47.704
<v Speaker 2>that was obviously a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like the normal person would </v>

870
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 2>do it like affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not at all.</v>

871
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Do you really think that Anthony Bordain</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to fucking poison Donald Trump and</v>

872
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>they should lose our jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's amazing by the way.</v>

873
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 2>She's a beast on its culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrage culture.</v>

874
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 2>People just decide they can try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect something.</v>

875
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 2>And then things start getting ramped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the momentum kicks in,</v>

876
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 2>all these other people jump on board and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get excited about being a part of a</v>

877
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 2>group that wants to get Anthony Bourdain</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked off the day,</v>

878
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of weird direction.</v>

879
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.644
<v Speaker 2>They think they're important enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can get these people fired </v>

880
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:20.920
<v Speaker 2>and they think if they get together </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

881
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:21.754
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have the power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect that person life even believed </v>

882
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:23.700
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

883
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of pitches.</v>

884
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kept saying,</v>

885
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening the life of Potus.</v>

886
00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>

887
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king,</v>

888
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.203
<v Speaker 2>you guys are out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a person with a terrible job </v>

889
00:39:36.081 --> 00:39:36.914
<v Speaker 2>saying that game of thrones Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a person with a job that no one </v>

890
00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

891
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what he is doing a good job at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

892
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is anybody doing a good job at it?</v>

893
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.823
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Obama was like the best </v>

894
00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 2>president we ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you look at it.</v>

895
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I know people can get mad at me for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot,</v>

896
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that I think that he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't agree with,</v>

897
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.543
<v Speaker 2>like the way went after the press with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he promised to protect </v>

898
00:39:58.031 --> 00:39:58.864
<v Speaker 2>whistleblowers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he never did like free speech and </v>

899
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.193
<v Speaker 2>people having to give up their sources </v>
<v Speaker 2>was damaged heavily during Obama's </v>

900
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:05.764
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

901
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.530
<v Speaker 2>The use of drones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented use of drones,</v>

902
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented amount of civilian deaths </v>
<v Speaker 2>during his administration.</v>

903
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.170
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of that was his fault?</v>

904
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 2>How much can one man even control?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

905
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an impossible fucking job,</v>

906
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.493
<v Speaker 2>but the way he carries himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a person I'd love more than it is </v>

907
00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:27.790
<v Speaker 2>about here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he can enunciate clearly.</v>

908
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:28.300
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

909
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was like a good representative </v>

910
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 2>of what I would like to see as a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>

911
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.520
<v Speaker 2>educated American who's smart and he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

912
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.240
<v Speaker 2>he's affable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems friendly and Nice.</v>

913
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.133
<v Speaker 2>He seems like one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the first president that kind of </v>

914
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:48.420
<v Speaker 2>seems like one of us where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>chill with them and you could have.</v>

915
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I could actually relate to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

916
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't Bill Clinton White House and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>

917
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I think if I was alone with Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't be able to jive with</v>

918
00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:56.950
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think.</v>

919
00:40:56.951 --> 00:40:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a chicken.</v>

920
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.040
<v Speaker 2>The room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it looked right past you.</v>

921
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.580
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to cock block with that room.</v>

922
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think almost not like a rooster.</v>

923
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I think Clinton's a straight up rooster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

924
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.980
<v Speaker 2>he's in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like he just can't help himself.</v>

925
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.510
<v Speaker 2>He's just got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's flinging Dick.</v>

926
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I got time to talk to some fucking old </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian.</v>

927
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm hurting the sligo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

928
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you were fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you voted for my grades.</v>

929
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time ago.</v>

930
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Face to get my deck.</v>

931
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I ain't got that much time.</v>

932
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 2>If you looked at me lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

933
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

934
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking this up,</v>

935
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>

936
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.120
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

937
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.770
<v Speaker 2>have you ever been on Air Force One?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

938
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I still get to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they still get to use it.</v>

939
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.980
<v Speaker 2>They get secret service through the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their lives.</v>

940
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 2>How they fly around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fly around commercial.</v>

941
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.873
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

942
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>President Carter was on a train like </v>
<v Speaker 2>high five and they're not train a flight</v>

943
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 2>high and everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Carter was a beautiful person.</v>

944
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 2>That's why you only lasted one term.</v>

945
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've negotiated with the hostages in </v>

946
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:14.414
<v Speaker 2>Iran to make sure that the hostages </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't released until after Ronald </v>

947
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Reagan was elected president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that is some shady shirt,</v>

948
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.433
<v Speaker 2>dirty shit politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kept Americans imprisoned extra so </v>

949
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 2>that you would look good and they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be released when this fucking actor with</v>

950
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 2>slick black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black hair gotta crack a few eggs,</v>

951
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:36.600
<v Speaker 2>make an omelet man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

952
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.580
<v Speaker 2>None of that stuff spreads me when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to politics or none of it.</v>

953
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:41.414
<v Speaker 2>So it's all business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan was also the first guy who used </v>

954
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:49.370
<v Speaker 2>the religious groups of our country to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get elected.</v>

955
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 2>He got them on board with him to let you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to do well.</v>

956
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.460
<v Speaker 2>He brought in religion to politics and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways or made it,</v>

957
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.353
<v Speaker 2>made it popular and obvious that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a good choice to align yourself as </v>

958
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:01.184
<v Speaker 2>being the PR.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no president today could be an </v>

959
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I disagree.</v>

960
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what do they live in for?</v>

961
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 2>They're out there in the White House </v>
<v Speaker 2>when to launch a nuclear bomb.</v>

962
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 2>They think that the end doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

963
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for God's heavenly glory.</v>

964
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's my heavenly father?</v>

965
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking over my heavenly father </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

966
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 2>What's the percentage of atheists in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

967
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 2>in the United States now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's higher than ever,</v>

968
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's still low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>

969
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.113
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

970
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:30.763
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Sakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's less than 30 percent </v>

971
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.953
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need those if you want to run </v>

972
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:35.384
<v Speaker 2>for president because people are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about the Lord than they are </v>

973
00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:40.580
<v Speaker 2>about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

974
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Twenty two percent of the US population </v>
<v Speaker 2>is religiously unaffiliated.</v>

975
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Atheist makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three point one percent ignacious makeup</v>

976
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:50.300
<v Speaker 2>for percent of the US population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two percent.</v>

977
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.930
<v Speaker 2>So it says at 22 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it says they're not religious.</v>

978
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:56.803
<v Speaker 2>The religiously unaffiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are votes for the theist </v>

979
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.983
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if that means </v>

980
00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 2>religiously unaffiliated like they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in God,</v>

981
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.100
<v Speaker 2>but they just don't belong to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>church we get in those votes.</v>

982
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:08.031
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>

983
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 2>14 general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

984
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.413
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those votes I think would go towards a </v>

985
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:14.420
<v Speaker 2>religious person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the person go back,</v>

986
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:18.380
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the person believes in God said to 14</v>

987
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:19.214
<v Speaker 2>General Social Survey reported that 21 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of Americans had no religion </v>

988
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 2>with three percent being atheist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>five percent agnostic.</v>

989
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 2>That's not even as much as I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that many people,</v>

990
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Ma'am are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot.</v>

991
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I just don't</v>

992
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.843
<v Speaker 1>think I shouldn't say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say this in a blanket term </v>

993
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:35.424
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think it's not a good </v>

994
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.244
<v Speaker 1>strategy if you're just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into office because trump was never </v>

995
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 1>religious and now he talks about God all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

996
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Now it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

997
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 1>God this and God that it's a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

998
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:48.144
<v Speaker 1>it's like you almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like words that you have to say </v>

999
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ma'am and Sir that don't know.</v>

1000
00:44:51.101 --> 00:44:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1001
00:44:52.271 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard the,</v>

1002
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:54.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the governor,</v>

1003
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's the mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida,</v>

1004
00:44:56.341 --> 00:44:57.174
<v Speaker 1>when the hurricane was about to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching just balls deep in it on </v>

1005
00:44:59.761 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>the hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that he's,</v>

1006
00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.860
<v Speaker 1>your money's great but big C and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pray for us.</v>

1008
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Just keep praying for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all we need.</v>

1009
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.580
<v Speaker 1>We need to pray before this thing hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1010
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better figure shit out like that.</v>

1011
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was everything.</v>

1012
00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Just keep praying for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pray.</v>

1013
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:17.370
<v Speaker 1>That's all I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone here,</v>

1014
00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:18.120
<v Speaker 1>pray for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1015
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.830
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need more than that brother.</v>

1016
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I made it work,</v>

1017
00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.693
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see this going around yesterday </v>

1018
00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.154
<v Speaker 5>afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook and got in trouble after some </v>

1019
00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:29.024
<v Speaker 5>people were digging into the advertising</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that was going around also </v>

1020
00:45:32.061 --> 00:45:34.820
<v Speaker 5>yesterday with the algorithms that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are looking into the Russian.</v>

1021
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.353
<v Speaker 5>I think someone uncovered that $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>had been paid to either some Russian ad </v>

1022
00:45:39.141 --> 00:45:41.870
<v Speaker 5>agency or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't follow the exact story,</v>

1023
00:45:41.871 --> 00:45:42.704
<v Speaker 5>but digging into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found this story that Jew haters </v>

1024
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.100
<v Speaker 5>and an algorithm created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1025
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.340
<v Speaker 5>this tag two people and labeled them as </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jew haters,</v>

1026
00:45:52.341 --> 00:45:55.610
<v Speaker 5>and so someone could buy a targeted ad </v>
<v Speaker 5>to them and what they were,</v>

1027
00:45:55.611 --> 00:45:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I guess they were assuming is that trump</v>
<v Speaker 5>people did it or they were.</v>

1028
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1029
00:45:59.661 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1030
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Explain this more clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone could put an ad on your page.</v>

1031
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.091
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1032
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:08.400
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of hypothetical.</v>

1033
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:09.234
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could put out an ad if I was a buying </v>

1034
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:12.480
<v Speaker 5>for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1035
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.314
<v Speaker 5>in this situation or for trump and </v>
<v Speaker 5>targeted towards people that were </v>

1036
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 5>labeled as Jew haters.</v>

1037
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 1>We're labeled as within facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1038
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.793
<v Speaker 1>So there's four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So facebook has a category of Jew </v>

1039
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:25.644
<v Speaker 1>haters.</v>

1040
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:28.120
<v Speaker 5>They're saying it was done by a computer</v>
<v Speaker 5>algorithm,</v>

1041
00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:29.500
<v Speaker 5>not by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

1042
00:46:29.501 --> 00:46:31.300
<v Speaker 5>by a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just sort of happened.</v>

1043
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.680
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.380
<v Speaker 5>And that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still being uncovered right now.</v>

1045
00:46:35.381 --> 00:46:37.840
<v Speaker 5>This just hit yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jew haters was trending on twitter.</v>

1046
00:46:37.841 --> 00:46:38.170
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1047
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:43.170
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook advertising the best that there</v>

1048
00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:46.330
<v Speaker 1>is like for anyone because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms,</v>

1049
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.540
<v Speaker 1>because you can pick out a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>demographic.</v>

1050
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.790
<v Speaker 1>If you have a show in San Francisco or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in La,</v>

1051
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you can literally pick everyone in a 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile radius and they will see that that,</v>

1052
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but that is such a crazy eight or figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

1053
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what a crazy thing.</v>

1054
00:47:00.191 --> 00:47:02.240
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you could reach a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews.</v>

1055
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 1>How about don't allow those people to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reaching them with it.</v>

1056
00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.520
<v Speaker 5>On this same answer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the same vein,</v>

1057
00:47:09.521 --> 00:47:10.354
<v Speaker 5>I was going to ask you a second ago when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said you were looking at Anthony </v>

1058
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.780
<v Speaker 5>Bourdain's twitter account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saw a bunch of hate.</v>

1059
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1060
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that that could be bots Bot</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me correct that.</v>

1061
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.260
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Anthony Bourdain's twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

1062
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a under the tweet by TMZ for show</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

1063
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Then there was all even that even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure they probably went this.</v>

1064
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>It even easier to do.</v>

1065
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:35.110
<v Speaker 5>Then you could specifically by by that </v>
<v Speaker 5>hate for cheap,</v>

1066
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 5>25 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 bucks,</v>

1067
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:41.170
<v Speaker 5>but they also hire people that might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple twins that mean by the,</v>

1068
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.161
<v Speaker 5>by that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1069
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:42.994
<v Speaker 5>you could send the messages that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want and you could set up a couple of </v>

1070
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.430
<v Speaker 5>keywords and 500 accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll just start sending those messages,</v>

1071
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.030
<v Speaker 5>fake accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fake accounts,</v>

1072
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:50.873
<v Speaker 5>so accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people are going to go look </v>

1073
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 5>through to find out how many of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>accounts are fake,</v>

1074
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.613
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to write out the tweet for </v>

1075
00:47:57.431 --> 00:47:59.190
<v Speaker 5>those fig fig?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll fill in the word</v>

1076
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.183
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know if someone is doing </v>

1077
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great question.</v>

1078
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.850
<v Speaker 5>They're fighting that on youtube or </v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook,</v>

1079
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.450
<v Speaker 5>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the finding it everywhere and they're in</v>

1080
00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:09.830
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1081
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 2>How do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1082
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:12.184
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can tell by the algorithms in the </v>

1083
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:15.140
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Programmers can figure it out,</v>

1084
00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.990
<v Speaker 2>can make fake accounts for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I went twitter,</v>

1085
00:48:17.991 --> 00:48:18.824
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do a flush of all those Bot </v>

1086
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.300
<v Speaker 2>accounts and so you'll see a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's followers like Kim Kardashians.</v>

1087
00:48:23.301 --> 00:48:26.440
<v Speaker 2>She lost like 3 million because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a bunch of Bot accounts.</v>

1088
00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Fake accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1089
00:48:27.531 --> 00:48:28.364
<v Speaker 2>there's so many fake shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she lost three minute when </v>

1090
00:48:29.901 --> 00:48:32.810
<v Speaker 2>people saw her real ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

1091
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

1092
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the port now.</v>

1093
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that Mexican disaster?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1094
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.640
<v Speaker 2>she was on the beach in Mexico and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have her own photographer.</v>

1095
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want.</v>

1096
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to body shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes I do,</v>

1097
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.910
<v Speaker 2>but let me just explain my position on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1098
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.820
<v Speaker 2>When she shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she shows all these pictures of her</v>

1099
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:54.763
<v Speaker 2>giant perfect ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's showing an extremely unrealistic </v>

1100
00:48:58.971 --> 00:49:00.680
<v Speaker 2>representation of a human being.</v>

1101
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.873
<v Speaker 2>So what she does is she hires a </v>
<v Speaker 2>photographer to follow her everywhere </v>

1102
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:04.784
<v Speaker 2>and take pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they photoshop the shit out of </v>

1103
00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:08.900
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cleaned away all the lumps and then</v>

1104
00:49:08.901 --> 00:49:10.280
<v Speaker 2>she looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1105
00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.710
<v Speaker 2>So while she was on the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

1106
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.190
<v Speaker 2>They were taking pictures of her and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know they were there.</v>

1107
00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.930
<v Speaker 2>That is a dumper that's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a thing that's not real.</v>

1108
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.793
<v Speaker 2>That is all fat that someone stuffed </v>
<v Speaker 2>into your ass like a giant diaper and </v>

1109
00:49:25.431 --> 00:49:26.264
<v Speaker 2>when they smoothed it out and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram with all the retouches and </v>

1110
00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:30.734
<v Speaker 2>everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this forces women to like think that </v>

1111
00:49:33.651 --> 00:49:36.170
<v Speaker 2>this is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is normal.</v>

1112
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.033
<v Speaker 2>My Girl's ass beats by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's reel to reel and she's got a </v>

1113
00:49:40.071 --> 00:49:42.860
<v Speaker 2>body that it makes sense and she makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>her look like Mr.</v>

1114
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:43.783
<v Speaker 2>Burns as like if you have a giant head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a tiny little nose like one of </v>

1115
00:49:47.061 --> 00:49:48.920
<v Speaker 2>them plastic surgery knows people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>

1116
00:49:48.921 --> 00:49:51.680
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't right.</v>

1117
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Like you did something weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's what she's doing is not only not </v>

1118
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.390
<v Speaker 2>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could promise she becomes famous and</v>

1119
00:49:59.391 --> 00:50:01.170
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes a thing that people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>down here.</v>

1120
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when we're talking about wigs,</v>

1121
00:50:03.681 --> 00:50:05.570
<v Speaker 2>we weren't you here when we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about powdered wigs.</v>

1122
00:50:05.571 --> 00:50:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Was that you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you made a big think about that?</v>

1123
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.373
<v Speaker 2>These fucking guys with syphilis that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were losing their hair and started </v>

1124
00:50:11.631 --> 00:50:14.540
<v Speaker 2>wearing wigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody started shaving their head and</v>

1125
00:50:14.541 --> 00:50:17.810
<v Speaker 2>wearing those goddamn countered with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they looked like those guys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like Kim and hurt us and they cut into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bone in her jaw when she was 16.</v>

1153
00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:35.143
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now all these little girls look up </v>

1154
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 1>to her like she's this huge role model </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him like why do you,</v>

1155
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like her?</v>

1156
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And like just the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

1157
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.120
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she comes out with all this stuff.</v>

1158
00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:47.954
<v Speaker 1>She has lube aton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's driving guy because all of a </v>

1159
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:51.200
<v Speaker 1>sudden they think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's what I.</v>

1160
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what I get to big wigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big ways.</v>

1161
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So same goddamn thing.</v>

1162
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:57.563
<v Speaker 1>And so those dudes wearing wigs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody sees and they think they're </v>

1163
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the shit and so they want to copy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's dangerous.</v>

1164
00:52:02.351 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different though it is,</v>

1165
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's not same fishes but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same theory.</v>

1166
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:08.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1167
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.190
<v Speaker 1>but what she's doing is bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1168
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.253
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a trend and then people get </v>

1169
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 1>sucked into that trend and she becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1170
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's why I'm mad at myself.</v>

1189
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.033
<v Speaker 1>Kim's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Kylie who I think </v>

1190
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 1>she's 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before you know basic white girl,</v>

1191
00:53:05.241 --> 00:53:06.074
<v Speaker 1>average flat ass white girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then now she's this video vixen and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever felt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1197
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.490
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

1198
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Not if they have implants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can take fat from their stomach</v>

1199
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:25.320
<v Speaker 1>or their size and they inject the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ugly ass no different.</v>

1200
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they</v>

1201
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.933
<v Speaker 2>walked over to the bathroom and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see their ask going back and forth like </v>

1202
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:31.440
<v Speaker 2>a water bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't that freak you out?</v>

1203
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:32.743
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a video of what does that </v>

1204
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:39.800
<v Speaker 2>young age as lately Zalea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever her name is.</v>

1205
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 2>There was a video of her shaking her ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone sent it to me.</v>

1206
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:43.950

<v Speaker 2>Was it cool?</v>

1208
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's wearing these skin tight pants and</v>

1209
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:49.704
<v Speaker 2>as she's shaking her ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you ever try to fuck on a </v>

1210
00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 2>waterbed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1211
00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:53.400
<v Speaker 2>it's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.263
<v Speaker 2>I had one when I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a disaster and as a kid and then </v>

1213
00:53:56.281 --> 00:54:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I swapped it out for one with Baffles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually pretty bad ass.</v>

1214
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 2>A water bed that has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Baffles are it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one giant bag.</v>

1216
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1217
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 2>When you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty firm,</v>

1218
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:10.640
<v Speaker 2>but you feel the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warm plots.</v>

1219
00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dope but you get and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could fuck with one of those,</v>

1220
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.910
<v Speaker 2>but with the other one it's like trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuck on a whale the fucking night.</v>

1221
00:54:22.401 --> 00:54:23.234
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to fuck while your </v>
<v Speaker 2>paddleboarding is trying to fuck on one </v>

1222
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:28.590
<v Speaker 2>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the one of those vibrating machine.</v>

1223
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.863
<v Speaker 2>so that's what her ass looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's shaking her ass and it's going </v>

1225
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:38.571
<v Speaker 2>back and forth and back and forth like </v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy ass camel thing.</v>

1226
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Like you're storing water in Medicaid </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1227
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:46.110
<v Speaker 2>scalable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing fruit back,</v>

1228
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 2>dooring water in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's something going on.</v>

1229
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is this?</v>

1230
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's fine right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the video.</v>

1231
00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 2>There was a video of her dancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage.</v>

1232
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I wish I didn't like that stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but this is like,</v>

1234
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:08.880
<v Speaker 2>this is a little amusement as will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at different colors.</v>

1235
00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:10.010

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:12.780

<v Speaker 2>that that's the culture we live in.</v>

1237

<v Speaker 2>Dr Frankenstein's lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to picture you with a tube </v>

<v Speaker 2>same finish line though.</v>

1256
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you don't want to have sex with someone </v>

1265
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 2>who's barely making it.</v>

1266
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get a staph infection </v>
<v Speaker 2>because someone's been pumping fat into </v>

1267
00:56:41.931 --> 00:56:45.070
<v Speaker 2>your asshole and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling feeling sad,</v>

1268
00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but you still have this big ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that sexy?</v>

1269
00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not fun.</v>

1270
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:48.903
<v Speaker 2>It's not exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're looking at an unhealthy </v>

1271
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.593
<v Speaker 2>persons body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at her body like that's </v>

1272
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 2>not a working out body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't worked out for.</v>

1273
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:58.384
<v Speaker 2>She does because that's a lazy person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>body results and I'm not saying lazy </v>

1274
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 2>person like mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a full time job.</v>

1275
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't work out,</v>

1276
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blaming you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to work out,</v>

1277
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:09.484
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blaming you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if your fucking job is only to be </v>

1278
00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.760
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot chick and that's your body,</v>

1279
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you better work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1280
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you got to get on that horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least eat or good.</v>

1281
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

1282
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also love that.</v>

1283
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to talk a Gal who does some </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead lifts.</v>

1284
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I like how she's using those path to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cover shins.</v>

1285
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Something gross about girls scarred up </v>
<v Speaker 2>shins.</v>

1286
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.473
<v Speaker 2>Unless they fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they do Moitai then it's kind of </v>

1287
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 2>even then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's hot again.</v>

1288
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Leave and then gangster ass chick lit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good picture jamie,</v>

1289
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.750
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like bodies should be earned </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gym.</v>

1290
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just feel like pumping some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff into your ass,</v>

1291
00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's a trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about titties?</v>

1292
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 2>That's where I vacillate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1293
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't earn titties.</v>

1294
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:01.960
<v Speaker 2>That's why I let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't earn them.</v>

1295
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You can earn an ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of subject a little bit.</v>

1296
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost genetics.</v>

1297
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1298
00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be just be honest,</v>

1299
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about most.</v>

1300
00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 2>You can do some squats and deadlifts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunges,</v>

1301
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 2>build that SMP thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much you could probably affect it.</v>

1302
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:17.583
<v Speaker 2>You put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to not be able to get </v>

1303
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:20.860
<v Speaker 2>to Jayla levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bet you get to pretty perky levels</v>

1304
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.750
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1305
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1306
00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they're working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they got a good trainer.</v>

1307
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they lift heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have to see the program.</v>

1308
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to see their program.</v>

1309
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:30.994
<v Speaker 2>You have to find out what their diet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people make a lot of goddamn </v>

1310
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.750
<v Speaker 2>excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genetics or genetic,</v>

1311
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.720
<v Speaker 2>like Jamie's not going to get as big as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Yoel Romero.</v>

1312
00:58:38.721 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just not in the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1313
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:40.990
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1314
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Genetics do come into factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you just blame genetics for </v>

1315
00:58:44.531 --> 00:58:45.191
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1316
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:46.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did you work?</v>

1317
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.680
<v Speaker 2>How hard did you work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you try?</v>

1318
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you advance at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where was your starting point?</v>

1319
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Where are you at now and how much effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you put in along the way?</v>

1320
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 2>You're cool with titties because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a real woman's ass.</v>

1321
00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:02.040
<v Speaker 2>She is so real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty held sheedy 85 years old.</v>

1322
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Fifty one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good thing about that,</v>

1323
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:05.743
<v Speaker 2>you can shoot loads in there all day </v>
<v Speaker 2>long and nothing's happening all day </v>

1324
00:59:08.351 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's home game over.</v>

1325
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.210
<v Speaker 2>They're about to have a kid or to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's trying to.</v>

1326
00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.020
<v Speaker 2>You're all practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would try.</v>

1327
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I saw that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:20.464
<v Speaker 2>I would in pregnant her right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out was probably still viable </v>

1330
00:59:22.461 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 2>for another four or five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her genetics.</v>

1331
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.340
<v Speaker 2>She is a straight smoke show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1332
00:59:28.341 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 2>That's superior genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She Never Latina superior genetics.</v>

1333
00:59:32.871 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also hard work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She works out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this stuff that she does?</v>

<v Speaker 2>She's carving out hard hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>she's a professional hot chick was also </v>

1338
00:59:46.191 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 2>a singer who's also an actress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has talent.</v>

1339
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 2>These other groups come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not write,</v>

1340
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:52.000
<v Speaker 2>but she also works hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1341

<v Speaker 2>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sexy.</v>

1342
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I think.</v>

1343
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to spy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to be a man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the rock on the fucking instagram </v>

1346
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every God damn day we're here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

1350
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 2>He's like all inspiring and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's shocked to the fucking gills.</v>

1351
01:00:13.371 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>He looks huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1352
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 2>That isn't clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's an earned physique.</v>

1353
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Does not stuffing fucking silicon plates</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his muscles to puff them up.</v>

1354
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.733
<v Speaker 2>He's not injecting synthol in there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like one of them crazy </v>

1355
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and other stuff though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a four,</v>

1356
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:33.290
<v Speaker 2>but he's working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's working out hard.</v>

1357
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his test levels are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The probably elevated,</v>

1358
01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:41.260
<v Speaker 2>but the point is even with drugs that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible.</v>

1359
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.410
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still hard work,</v>

1360
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still a real muscle.</v>

1361
01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:49.443
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I draw the line look of girls </v>

1362
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:53.850
<v Speaker 2>could take a steroid that made them grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ass through.</v>

1363
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be a flat ass on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Earth Gangland.</v>

1364
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:58.583
<v Speaker 2>There would be no girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between girls and men is </v>

1365
01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:02.990
<v Speaker 2>that because there's a lot of guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take steroids.</v>

1366
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.651
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

1367
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:04.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some don't.</v>

1368
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>If steroids existed for women's assets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would be as common as botox?</v>

1369
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.520
<v Speaker 2>They would all be jamming it.</v>

1370
01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like here die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every girl would have a fat ass.</v>

1371
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.090
<v Speaker 2>If you could afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they could figure out a way to break.</v>

1372
01:01:20.091 --> 01:01:20.924
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving on the street the other </v>

1373
01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a sign that said Botox.</v>

1374
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 2>$12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1375
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a deal for sure.</v>

1376
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Don't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Bell's Palsy.</v>

1420
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I saw was a scary gentlemen an article </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1421
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>an interview they did with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a very,</v>

1422
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad and disappointed.</v>

1423
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was telling us.</v>

1424
01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1425
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was terrible task.</v>

1426
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So rough scale overcame that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about that.</v>

1427
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It was about his brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1428
01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:49.104
<v Speaker 1>What was he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying these are already starting to </v>

1429
01:03:50.071 --> 01:03:50.904
<v Speaker 1>slur his words and forget things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mustache and fanny pack shows me </v>

1430
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:54.564
<v Speaker 1>that I looked for signs that when I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mustache in that fanny pack was </v>

1431
01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Lorius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be every day when I run dia,</v>

1432
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't wear it to the Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket like a psycho.</v>

1433
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1434
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>They make sense though when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

1435
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

1436
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I just don't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1437
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.600
<v Speaker 1>So he was saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be done.</v>

1438
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one of my thanks.</v>

1439
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that he has brain trauma.</v>

1440
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>No Shit Sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1441
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:19.771
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1442
01:04:19.771 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking about it,</v>

1443
01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that he's slurring his words and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>having trouble remembering things.</v>

1444
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>But then you also said he was born to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1445
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>What are we supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he dies doing this,</v>

1446
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 1>he'd be fine with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put a,</v>

1447
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:35.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a caveat to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said if I die in the ring,</v>

1448
01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>like I want to die in the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out on my shield,</v>

1449
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but it better not be from someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>on pds.</v>

1450
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good point for </v>

1451
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>people over the last five people he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought and he tested positive for PDS or</v>

1452
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 1>tested?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1453
01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it was all pd because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought all of them.</v>

1454
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.230
<v Speaker 1>It was allister's test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive in the past,</v>

1455
01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:00.470
<v Speaker 1>these for doom and I'm jake bigfoot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jds right now is um,</v>

1456
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a diuretic,</v>

1457
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying as far as failing </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

1458
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:05.370
<v Speaker 1>if you would just go by failed tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every.</v>

1459
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.323
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Mark Hunt's career and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through and went guys test </v>

1460
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:10.801
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

1461
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:11.634

<v Speaker 1>no wonder he's infuriated at apple and </v>

1462
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>he has brain trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Superior genetics like Mark Hunt's</v>

1463
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.233
<v Speaker 2>genetics are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his ability to take a punch for </v>

1464
01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:22.384
<v Speaker 2>years was ungodly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would see him get hit and you'd be </v>

1465
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't even make sense.</v>

1466
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Is that he took cro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop head kicks,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1472
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.650

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a positive,</v>

1475
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>steep pays 100 percent legit as clean as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come.</v>

1476
01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>There's big Silva again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

1477
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.253
<v Speaker 2>He had a drop on them the first time you</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw crushed him the second time because </v>

1478
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the second time you side was involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigfoot.</v>

1479
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Silva wasn't on the juice and he got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

1480
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 2>The first time bigfoot Silva was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>

1481
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.640

<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1482
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 2>he tested negative before the fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive after the fight,</v>

1483
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:10.683
<v Speaker 2>which means he juiced himself up before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight and they had that incredible </v>

1484
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.090
<v Speaker 2>epic five round war.</v>

1485
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.983
<v Speaker 2>Remember that fight and it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so epic that Dana White had a </v>

1486
01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:20.914
<v Speaker 2>bunch of Mark Hunt roots of fights too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made like for two before to ever </v>

1487
01:06:26.681 --> 01:06:27.514
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They printed up the jackets for two and </v>

1488
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.060
<v Speaker 2>he sent me one and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1489
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:31.894
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the craziest fights of </v>

1490
01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 2>all time and then a week later came big </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot test positive and he's like,</v>

1491
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:39.700
<v Speaker 2>this dumb motherfucker like this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been like this.</v>

1492
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:06:40.991 --> 01:06:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just the Joshua Klitschko </v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

1494
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible matchup.</v>

1495
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He tests positive and then you saw it</v>

1496
01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 2>as on his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they come back for the second fight</v>

1497
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.860
<v Speaker 2>and mark hunches smokes them in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

1498
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean just ran through them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just look at him.</v>

1499
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So he got big foot jds is under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1500
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.400
<v Speaker 2>he's had his issues.</v>

1501
01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:00.283
<v Speaker 2>He got Ben Rothwell busted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was going to say though is if </v>

1502
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 2>anybody legitimately has a reason for </v>
<v Speaker 2>using steroids,</v>

1503
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:07.563
<v Speaker 2>it's bigfoot because bigfoot has real </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantism and he had a tumor removed </v>

1504
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:11.614
<v Speaker 2>from his pituitary gland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his body doesn't produce </v>

1505
01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1506
01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Or any hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1507
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Body's a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a.</v>

1508
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a gray area because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>great because it's brain surgery.</v>

1509
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 2>He had a tumor on his pituitary aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1510
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even even if you get,</v>

1511
01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.683
<v Speaker 2>if you give them trt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to regulate so much where he </v>

1512
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:31.384
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have such an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should cause him </v>

1513
01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:34.930
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is awful.</v>

1514
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You can't compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying more than that.</v>

1515
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you shouldn't be able to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1516
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the business for you.</v>

1517
01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:44.770
<v Speaker 2>If you have to have testosterone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete,</v>

1518
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 2>unless you want to go to Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

1519
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.780
<v Speaker 2>it's skin birthed out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1520
01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:50.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably done it.</v>

1521
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's had so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many crazy crazy fights,</v>

1522
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.560
<v Speaker 2>but he was the first guy to Tko Faye </v>
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>

1523
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:57.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was at that shit when he mounted </v>

1524
01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.850

01:08:00.851 --> 01:08:01.684
<v Speaker 2>Just giant finger going like this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just did fader was done because </v>

1526
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.950
<v Speaker 2>fader in all seriousness should've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>a two.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1528
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:15.190

<v Speaker 2>talented and ridiculously skillful</v>

1529
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>in his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His execution and just figured out a way</v>

1530
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:22.420
<v Speaker 1>to win was lightening fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked a lot of people out.</v>

1531
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.263
<v Speaker 1>But God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if he got himself and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Here's back to marketing and this is </v>

1549
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 1>bombing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Russians now from Russia.</v>

1562

<v Speaker 1>He's have a sweet left high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick it doesn't do much orthodox.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just uh,</v>

1571
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're marketing,</v>

1572
01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.501
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1573
01:09:57.501 --> 01:09:58.334
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I'm the main event on </v>

1574
01:09:58.701 --> 01:09:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

1575
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:00.043
<v Speaker 1>But at what point do we have someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we have a guy like the golden </v>

1576
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:07.220
<v Speaker 1>snitch in the UFC who is watching out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that stuff is going,</v>

1577
01:10:07.221 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mark Hunt doing every word.</v>

1578
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>He has some real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1579
01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone to look out to take care </v>

1580
01:10:12.591 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 1>of these guys because mark come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on and shield I don't want.</v>

1581
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:16.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch marketing 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitting his pants and drooling and </v>

1582
01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.390
<v Speaker 1>doesn't remember his fight career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1583
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck if he repeats that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian guy in Australia.</v>

1584
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>He has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has nothing to prove.</v>

1585
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it do for him?</v>

1586
01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point you really,</v>

1587
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.893
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation that stops people from </v>

1588
01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:35.684
<v Speaker 1>hurting themselves when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've taken too much damage and they </v>

1589
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>can't make good decisions anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1590
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.640
<v Speaker 1>But then it becomes a personal freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1591
01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.493
<v Speaker 1>Free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1592
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Because because there's a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of damage you're going to take,</v>

1593
01:10:45.081 --> 01:10:45.914
<v Speaker 1>like there's fights that probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't get made like Francis and </v>

1594
01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:49.671
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1595
01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:50.960
<v Speaker 1>versus almost anybody.</v>

1596
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Almost anybody says agreeing to getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking head scrambled.</v>

1597
01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what happens with </v>

1598
01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:00.134
<v Speaker 1>allister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see if allister can survive </v>

1599
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>for allister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Because in Ghana clip some once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>allister could be in deep,</v>

1601
01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:08.390
<v Speaker 1>deep trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1602
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Francis has never fought a strike or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level striker,</v>

1603
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>let alone the best of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The division,</v>

1604
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have the same chin so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1605
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Match up fast.</v>

1606
01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Too many scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allister's Francis Francis.</v>

1607
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Well alster is clearly fast too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1608
01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But Francis always do is touch that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chin.</v>

1609
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Once true Francis puts people to sleep.</v>

1610
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I got to see him do at a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level.</v>

1611
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Jump on the train when you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities,</v>

1612
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but when you watched it with a Lawsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arloski is already down down the slope.</v>

1613
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:43.000

<v Speaker 1>so that was impressive.</v>

1617
01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a good test because Arlovski </v>
<v Speaker 1>still knocked out.</v>

1618
01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.780

<v Speaker 1>like the driving fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashing into that lady's car.</v>

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:54.283
<v Speaker 1>You Take away the things that hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you just have party and </v>

1720
01:15:56.501 --> 01:15:58.060
<v Speaker 1>having a good time and occasionally do </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

1721
01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to care and that's give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1722
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fun guy.</v>

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:02.374
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just gotta make sure you </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid hurting other people and then </v>

1724
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thyroid thing is the goddamn that's</v>

1725
01:16:09.671 --> 01:16:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the knife in the heart like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1726
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

1727
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.833
<v Speaker 1>you gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look into this drought ball stuff with </v>

1728
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the baseball.</v>

1729
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.520
<v Speaker 1>All these guys who have all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that gnc.</v>

1730
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:19.354
<v Speaker 1>It's in all these supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and again I've been roasting </v>

1731
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.374
<v Speaker 1>john bad because I'm upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad at him because he's my favorite </v>

1732
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:26.830
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

1733
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.160
<v Speaker 1>so it is possible that he could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken something that's trace elements of</v>

1734
01:16:30.161 --> 01:16:30.994
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also seen that other things are </v>

1735
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:34.084
<v Speaker 1>recognized as that stuff in the task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a hard time believing that </v>

1736
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know that.</v>

1737
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I know so I have a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they come clean with us,</v>

1738
01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 1>they'd come out with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's ever been proven once</v>

1739
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.903
<v Speaker 1>that they said that a person had tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for something and that that </v>

1740
01:16:49.601 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>person had never actually taken that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1741
01:16:51.491 --> 01:16:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not seen that one.</v>

1742
01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:54.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw a so thorough it.</v>

1743
01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.713

<v Speaker 1>Just fucking dead calm about it.</v>

1747
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Not judgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the facts going over the details.</v>

1748
01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.613
<v Speaker 1>This is what bothered me the little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why I'm going back and forth on </v>

1749
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:17.120
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

1754
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Even if my manager like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1757
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:31.873
<v Speaker 1>This maybe I took this supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never done steroids in my fucking </v>

1758
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:35.450
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is bullshit.</v>

1759
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say too much if it's going</v>

1760
01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:39.194
<v Speaker 1>to go to some sort of a arbitration or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial or I don't know what the process </v>

1761
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can if you didn't take it,</v>

1762
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.000
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to find out how.</v>

1763
01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 1>If there is a way that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1764
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>a loophole safe you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's you,</v>

1765
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:52.953
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you take something from gmc and </v>

1766
01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe you take a bunch of shit and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought everything was good and then you</v>

1767
01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:02.570
<v Speaker 1>get tested positive before you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1768
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:03.404
<v Speaker 1>I never took steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to find out what the fuck </v>

1769
01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 1>it is was in those stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1770
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:08.443
<v Speaker 1>So you have to report those things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they have to check and then they </v>

1771
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:13.180
<v Speaker 1>have to independently by those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a shelf,</v>

1772
01:18:13.181 --> 01:18:17.450
<v Speaker 1>from somewhere else to confirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a process.</v>

1773
01:18:17.451 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the thing that jeff </v>
<v Speaker 1>novitsky said.</v>

1774
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 1>You got to let the process play out </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start accusing john.</v>

1775
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So there'll be a process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

1776
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:29.750
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good a sample and be sample.</v>

1777
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

1778
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I just think it could go a long ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his fans and everything going on.</v>

1779
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:37.970
<v Speaker 1>If he came out and was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you guys,</v>

1780
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.630

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>but there's a different standard way </v>
<v Speaker 1>less are now,</v>

1832
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:40.854
<v Speaker 1>but I think for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42 supplements including some that are </v>

1833
01:20:44.781 --> 01:20:49.781
<v Speaker 1>available at gnc contribute or positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>test for toronto ball sports article.</v>

1834
01:20:50.491 --> 01:20:50.950
<v Speaker 1>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:52.710
<v Speaker 1>The official said the cubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1836
01:20:52.711 --> 01:20:55.650
<v Speaker 1>we're reminded this week that players </v>
<v Speaker 1>should only.</v>

1837
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:56.543
<v Speaker 1>She used only supplement certified by </v>
<v Speaker 1>nsf international and independent </v>

1838
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:01.890
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tests and approved products,</v>

1839
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.220
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of shit.</v>

1840
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the union havers concerned about the run</v>

1841
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:08.094
<v Speaker 1>of suspension of tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to seek evidence that might </v>

1842
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:11.664
<v Speaker 1>shed light on why some players are </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing positive because so many guys </v>

1843
01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.150
<v Speaker 1>are testing positive for it.</v>

1844
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't this a short acting drug though </v>

1845
01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 1>that's out of your system fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly?</v>

1846
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the thing about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1847
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.590
<v Speaker 1>but then there's even debate on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1848
01:21:25.591 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 1>jill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1849
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:27.384
<v Speaker 1>Why did I see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don'T I see something that said it </v>

1850
01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 1>had a 60 day window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

1851
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen weeks,</v>

1852
01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I've seen days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen ours again.</v>

1853
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 1>We don't fucking know dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been explained to me the stuff that</v>

1854
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:38.034
<v Speaker 1>gets out of your system the quickest is </v>
<v Speaker 1>those little edible testosterone things </v>

1855
01:21:41.101 --> 01:21:41.934
<v Speaker 1>like the gummies and stuff around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are just a few hours in a few </v>

1856
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:46.990
<v Speaker 1>hours or out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing we're going to,</v>

1857
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.530
<v Speaker 1>just like we're doing now with baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like barry bonds,</v>

1858
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:52.410
<v Speaker 1>mark mcgwire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sammy sosa at the time were like,</v>

1859
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.070
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pds whole month.</v>

1860
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.520
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The years go by,</v>

1861
01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:57.363
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are still pretty fucking </v>

1862
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.320
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1863
01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.153
<v Speaker 1>If even the pitchers were sauced up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that could happen with john to </v>

1864
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 1>like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years that he knows he's the greatest</v>

1865
01:22:04.891 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>of all time still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:08.010
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because danIel cormier wasn't sauced up.</v>

1867
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Daniel cormier was totally on the notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe that?</v>

1868
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume he is.</v>

1869
01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.170
<v Speaker 1>You have to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume he is.</v>

1870
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason not to.</v>

1871
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything in this world </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1872
01:22:23.221 --> 01:22:24.270
<v Speaker 1>When it comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1873
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta think man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your futures on the line.</v>

1875
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:30.383
<v Speaker 1>Your career's on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been out of the game for </v>

1876
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.590
<v Speaker 1>essentially two and a half years plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>one fight in between there,</v>

1877
01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the osp fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's been at a cage for a long time.</v>

1878
01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 1>You got to fight the best in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best in the world.</v>

1879
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Skeptical tomato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got all this pressure on you and you</v>

1880
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.570
<v Speaker 1>just go just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little bit.</v>

1881
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you need that help if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1882
01:22:56.191 --> 01:22:59.040
<v Speaker 1>John might not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might not to go the club.</v>

1883
01:22:59.041 --> 01:22:59.874
<v Speaker 1>Do a couple of cans of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's maybe it's one of those things </v>

1884
01:23:02.581 --> 01:23:04.860
<v Speaker 1>where he's always used it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got away with it.</v>

1885
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Now he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he took a supplement that had an </v>

1886
01:23:09.771 --> 01:23:11.170
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we really don't know.</v>

1887
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that stress that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe you got to kinda before</v>

1888
01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:19.180
<v Speaker 1>casting 100 percent judgment on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta let it play out,</v>

1889
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but this is the thing we say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let it play out.</v>

1890
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm playing both sides of the </v>

1891
01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>field here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you say let it play out,</v>

1892
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.220
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know he has a history of fucking up.</v>

1893
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.533
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to hang him before it's </v>

1894
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:31.460
<v Speaker 1>actually come out because we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1895
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:32.303
<v Speaker 1>he's consistently good at beating people</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and fucking up and here's another </v>

1896
01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:36.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1897
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1898
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why everyone's like,</v>

1899
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:40.540
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done to me.</v>

1900
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's depressing to us,</v>

1901
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As fans because he's so fucking good and</v>

1902
01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:49.450
<v Speaker 1>to know that he's going to be out </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly for four years now.</v>

1903
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.440
<v Speaker 1>That shit's just devastating to me when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we meet him.</v>

1904
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I know people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1905
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:55.594
<v Speaker 1>We fucking medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like steep pay for the </v>

1906
01:23:57.521 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucked.</v>

1907
01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you know,</v>

1908
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 1>tough fight for steep bit and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was gonna fight.</v>

1909
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:07.144
<v Speaker 1>Brock lesnar we gusts in dc again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much out there to versus </v>

1910
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>steep a for the heavyweight title would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be wise.</v>

1911
01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about fucking dragons and jon</v>
<v Speaker 1>snow.</v>

1912
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's because neither one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1913
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.640
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1914
01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:22.474
<v Speaker 1>It's like what your theory about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fertittas pumping up with reebok and </v>

1915
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:30.880
<v Speaker 1>with usada and then just to sell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>science do theory,</v>

1916
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very good theory that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't heard before.</v>

1917
01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:37.450
<v Speaker 1>A word I'd never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your theory entirely your idea to.</v>

1918
01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's evidence,</v>

1919
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the evidence was always there.</v>

1920
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always put two and two together.</v>

1921
01:24:45.131 --> 01:24:45.964
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's genius mean if they really played </v>

1922
01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that three d chess,</v>

1923
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.540
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

1924
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:54.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it really is a smart man.</v>

1925
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.300
<v Speaker 1>If you just bought it and you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wme,</v>

1926
01:24:58.870 --> 01:25:03.870

<v Speaker 1>fertitta is this jewish sot of thing?</v>

1927
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:07.970

<v Speaker 1>They better pray to god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That golden snitch contract runs out in </v>

1944
01:25:48.581 --> 01:25:49.414
<v Speaker 1>the next two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bringing that russian cat from a </v>

<v Speaker 1>charisse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it whatever it is.</v>

1946
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Are you bringing everybody in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>

1947
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.620
<v Speaker 1>All The russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the best at it.</v>

1948
01:25:56.710 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring them in.</v>

1949
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.430
<v Speaker 1>This guy had this dude on a protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell asleep.</v>

1950
01:26:00.431 --> 01:26:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I Was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want only watch the first 15 minutes.</v>

1951
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Then I to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch the rest of it.</v>

1952
01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.193
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was banging like five different </v>

1953
01:26:07.611 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 1>things in his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These like amber liquids.</v>

1954
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It looked like Jack Daniels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1955
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>he's a cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very slim guy,</v>

1956
01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.593
<v Speaker 1>but he just started doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just started doing this while I was </v>

1957
01:26:19.221 --> 01:26:20.054
<v Speaker 1>listening to sky and I guess the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to test him and he's </v>

1958
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.390
<v Speaker 1>given ped forever and he's going to test</v>
<v Speaker 1>the siCk.</v>

1959
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I need to see the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like I said,</v>

1961
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes into it.</v>

1962
01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I wme you're looking at that going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1963
01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:35.130
<v Speaker 1>when's that contract up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to the reebok.</v>

1964
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 1>You're literally going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to tear it down and go,</v>

1965
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

1966
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 1>let us do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys got to this point.</v>

1967
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't working for us now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:26:42.501 --> 01:26:43.334
<v Speaker 1>those are two ideas that look good to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell to another company and make it </v>

1969
01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:48.130
<v Speaker 1>legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is like,</v>

1970
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 1>if you can get a better deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right,</v>

1971
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:51.014
<v Speaker 1>you have a deal with reebok goes for so </v>
<v Speaker 1>long and then if it's profitable for </v>

1972
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:55.670
<v Speaker 1>reebok and adidas comes in and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1973
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 1>we like what you're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1974
01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.250
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1975
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:59.960
<v Speaker 1>switch it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go adidas.</v>

1976
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you have a bidding war between </v>
<v Speaker 1>adidas and reebok.</v>

1977
01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe nike thinks about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1978
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 1>if you can prove that you're cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport up,</v>

1979
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with usada,</v>

1980
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:12.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a very smart move to get a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>company to invest in a sport that's when</v>

1981
01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you do it.</v>

1982
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.470
<v Speaker 1>But the big company as to see some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a payback,</v>

1983
01:27:15.471 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 1>that's why people were pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were like,</v>

1984
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:21.440
<v Speaker 1>well the sponsorship doesn't match what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were getting before.</v>

1985
01:27:21.441 --> 01:27:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you had a real issue with that.</v>

1986
01:27:23.631 --> 01:27:26.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a big like $100 plus thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a fight.</v>

1987
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1988
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:31.030
<v Speaker 1>that was the biggest issue is I liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uniform system and make it look like</v>

1989
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.903
<v Speaker 1>professional sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're gonna bring in a major </v>

1990
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.060
<v Speaker 1>sponsor like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then cut down,</v>

1991
01:27:35.061 --> 01:27:37.430
<v Speaker 1>guys pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're fucking the product.</v>

1992
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:38.264
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wHat you don't realize is you </v>

<v Speaker 1>middleman.</v>

1994
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You're screwing reebok because no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>had any issues with reebok.</v>

1995
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're owning the crossfit world.</v>

1996
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:51.280
<v Speaker 1>They're doing things actually like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no issues with your back.</v>

1997

2015
01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:37.160
<v Speaker 1>usada or only thing I forgot is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc has committed millions of dollars to</v>

2017
01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:43.694
<v Speaker 1>sponsor like reebok,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a good way to ensure that </v>

<v Speaker 3>The sport that will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

2038
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.400
<v Speaker 3>You got to know it now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I let people assume I let people.</v>

2042
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:46.603

2043
01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.633
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't think the golden snitch is going </v>

2044
01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.970
<v Speaker 3>to go on the ariel helwani show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Go away,</v>

2046
01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.230

<v Speaker 3>I would just take him out of it,</v>

2051
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:12.594
<v Speaker 3>the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not say anything to the public and then </v>

2052
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:15.900
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you have all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you don't see don fry all the tIme being</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed on tv.</v>

2170
01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:46.674
<v Speaker 3>You don't think about like his fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>with takiyama when they both stood in </v>

2171
01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:51.160
<v Speaker 3>front of each other and blast each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face over and over and over.</v>

2172
01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.013
<v Speaker 3>The older generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in their nature to do that and </v>

2173
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:54.734
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not very good on camera and </v>

2174
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2175
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 3>I think as you go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I mean,</v>

2176
01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.890
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see guys coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>though maybe I hope,</v>

2177
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.140
<v Speaker 3>but it just because people don't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2178
01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:03.974
<v Speaker 3>they fade away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying I do not in the </v>

2179
01:36:05.931 --> 01:36:06.511
<v Speaker 3>spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2180
01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:08.360
<v Speaker 3>they're not as poly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people don't think about that.</v>

2181
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:10.220
<v Speaker 3>When you think of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of,</v>

2182
01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:11.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching tyron woodley right now in his </v>

2183
01:36:13.131 --> 01:36:15.710
<v Speaker 3>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know he's doing damage,</v>

2184
01:36:15.711 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2185
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:18.290
<v Speaker 3>he's had some good fights but he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fine.</v>

2186
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think of it as one knockout last gen</v>

2187
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.373
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2188
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 3>nate marquardt in strikeforce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like the only,</v>

2189
01:36:25.131 --> 01:36:27.620
<v Speaker 3>like real bad loss that he has the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>losses,</v>

2190
01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:28.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2191
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:31.250
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem like he's in a bad place,</v>

2192
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:32.640
<v Speaker 3>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2193
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't see guys that were in the ufc </v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

2194
01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2195
01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 3>that took crazy debt.</v>

2196
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:40.303
<v Speaker 3>Like gary goodrich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big daddy goodrich who went over to k </v>

2197
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 3>one and he's got crazy cte now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>

2198
01:36:46.311 --> 01:36:47.170
<v Speaker 3>He talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2199
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.013
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talks about it really openly and </v>

2200
01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:50.723
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a great twitter to follow them </v>

2201
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.533
<v Speaker 3>on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2202
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.640
<v Speaker 3>with you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2204
01:36:57.351 --> 01:36:59.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd want to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd want people to know.</v>

2205
01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2206
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:06.770
<v Speaker 3>obviously if you're gonna fight brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumas,</v>

2207
01:37:06.771 --> 01:37:11.540
<v Speaker 3>one of the commission,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we do obviously.</v>

2208
01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:15.280
<v Speaker 3>So If he were to come on and my brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>ct,</v>

2209
01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like most people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

2210
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:18.830
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not watching it.</v>

2211
01:37:18.831 --> 01:37:19.940
<v Speaker 3>But you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2212
01:37:19.941 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see someone slurring their words.</v>

2213
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 3>You'd ever see Joe Frazier before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>died?</v>

2214
01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the opiod.</v>

2215
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Anthony show once and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>

2216
01:37:26.331 --> 01:37:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2217
01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:28.154
<v Speaker 3>this is hard to listen to man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like there's some guys like </v>

2218
01:37:31.311 --> 01:37:32.610
<v Speaker 3>that in the afc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2219
01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't mention names of some guys who I</v>

2220
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:36.560
<v Speaker 3>have conversations with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2221
01:37:36.561 --> 01:37:37.400
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2222
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:38.960
<v Speaker 3>You see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like nobody rides for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get hit enough.</v>

2224
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Just it's the weird thing is the number </v>
<v Speaker 3>is different for everybody.</v>

2225
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:49.110
<v Speaker 3>like the number for one guy like Mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunt.</v>

2226
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:49.993
<v Speaker 3>It took years and years and years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and years and years for his chin </v>

2227
01:37:52.401 --> 01:37:55.070
<v Speaker 3>started failing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think about the fights.</v>

2228
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 3>He had the strike</v>

2229
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

2230
01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2231
01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 1>k one pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride fights.</v>

2232
01:38:02.131 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2233
01:38:03.301 --> 01:38:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I think he fought and dream as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When dId melvin manhoef knock them out?</v>

2234
01:38:07.501 --> 01:38:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Was that in dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2235
01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:10.323
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2236
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just the all the k one bounce man.</v>

2237
01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a k one grumpy caitlyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:19.680
<v Speaker 1>mean he fought some fucking warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a k one?</v>

2239
01:38:19.681 --> 01:38:20.514
<v Speaker 1>Mma fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2240
01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean just there's only so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those fights you could have.</v>

2241
01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:27.820
<v Speaker 1>it is weird how certain guys get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>their capabilities to take punches so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much longer than the other guys.</v>

2243
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 1>We doN't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a structured thing.</v>

2244
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The way they're built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you're built,</v>

2245
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:39.950
<v Speaker 1>like Mark Hunt is built like a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's five,</v>

2246
01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>10 to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a tank.</v>

2247
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 1>The other problem is the size of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2248
01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.430
<v Speaker 1>His body's denseness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see his shins,</v>

2249
01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:49.920
<v Speaker 1>like when mark is standing in front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his knees are giant,</v>

2250
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:52.560
<v Speaker 1>his knees are like this big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His shins are huge.</v>

2251
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.900
<v Speaker 1>He's like a thick bone guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2252
01:38:54.901 --> 01:38:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the other issue is is you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as a shame mixed martial arts</v>

2253
01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.870
<v Speaker 1>called mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc,</v>

2254
01:39:00.871 --> 01:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>but mixed martial arts is so new in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand scheme of things compared to other</v>

2255
01:39:04.441 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the best way to train,</v>

2256
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 1>to stay healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not get in trouble.</v>

2257
01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 1>We have not been people trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there's doctors.</v>

2258
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 1>It Just hasn't been around long enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in football and the cfl just passed</v>

2259
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:16.734
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to put pads on and </v>

2260
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:21.480
<v Speaker 1>practicing where they hitting practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one that is a rule smart and now the</v>

2261
01:39:21.481 --> 01:39:23.310
<v Speaker 1>nfl is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look into that.</v>

2262
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.233
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nfl only has I think 14 days of pad </v>

2263
01:39:26.881 --> 01:39:27.714
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're in pads during the </v>

2264
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:30.480
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want to eliminate that.</v>

2265
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been around for a grip.</v>

2266
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 1>The best saving grace for the sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

2267
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.170
<v Speaker 1>or the best hope for the sport would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical science.</v>

2268
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Medical science comes along with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stem cell regeneration thing.</v>

2269
01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Brain come back to 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which god totally possible.</v>

2270
01:39:48.210 --> 01:39:49.043
<v Speaker 1>They just have to crack the code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just think about what they can do </v>

2271
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.130
<v Speaker 1>with other parts of your body to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can repair things.</v>

2272
01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:57.060
<v Speaker 1>The brain is far more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything we have to deal with,</v>

2273
01:39:57.061 --> 01:40:00.420
<v Speaker 1>but if you could somehow or another rig </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

2274
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.313
<v Speaker 1>the body's ability to heal itself and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact they have a new chip that they're </v>

2275
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:06.780
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2276
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:07.663
<v Speaker 1>that they're working on now where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>install it in a person's body and it </v>

2277
01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:16.071
<v Speaker 1>reprograms your genes and they think it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can repair brain trauma injuries,</v>

2278
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.170
<v Speaker 1>tissue damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the effects of aging.</v>

2279
01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2280
01:40:21.150 --> 01:40:21.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chip you put into your body and </v>

2281
01:40:23.641 --> 01:40:24.474
<v Speaker 1>it reprograms your genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's probably at some very </v>

2282
01:40:27.481 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 1>embryonic stage of development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trillion dollars.</v>

2283
01:40:30.841 --> 01:40:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

2284
01:40:31.681 --> 01:40:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but they're true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably trying to juice up,</v>

2285
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement for it by making it this.</v>

2286
01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell.</v>

2287
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2288
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.861
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2289
01:40:40.861 --> 01:40:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the store with my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder was fucked.</v>

2290
01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I was ready to get shoulder surgery was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting all the time.</v>

2291
01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brains for an animal.</v>

2292
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2293
01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It is like you talk the way more can you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2294
01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You listen to the scientists go,</v>

2295
01:40:53.171 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need</v>

2296
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 2>a new heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can make that you had lungs,</v>

2297
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:59.620
<v Speaker 2>muscle bones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make all that can help your brain</v>

2298
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:00.454
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now stop and think about where we were </v>

2299
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:03.970
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years ago.</v>

2300
01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:04.804
<v Speaker 2>None of those things are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all these ideas that are commonplace </v>

2301
01:41:08.201 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just science fiction.</v>

2302
01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Fifty years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years from now,</v>

2303
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>they might be able to use this ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you found that thing that chip?</v>

2304
01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 2>The one I found isn't even new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's from three years ago,</v>

2305
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>but made by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2306
01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:20.651
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2307
01:41:20.651 --> 01:41:21.484
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new chip installed under skin </v>

2308
01:41:25.781 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 2>that reprograms dna and can heal </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>

2309
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2310
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:33.700
<v Speaker 2>forget about brain injurY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look at that because new chip,</v>

2311
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it can replicate and restore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Idea behind it is it can program the</v>

2312
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:44.210
<v Speaker 2>genes to replicate and restore any sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of injury to resolve.</v>

2313
01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 2>For some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was live science.com.</v>

2314
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:48.671
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2315
01:41:48.671 --> 01:41:49.504
<v Speaker 2>websites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science websites I go to the regular </v>

2316
01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 2>hitch about that is by the time that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>out you.</v>

2317
01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And I'd probably be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2318
01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.560
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be out real soon.</v>

2319
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.633
<v Speaker 2>Breakthrough device heels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's with a single touch device </v>

2320
01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.513
<v Speaker 2>instantly delivers new dna or rna into </v>
<v Speaker 2>living skin cells to change their </v>

2321
01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

2322
01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:07.413
<v Speaker 2>They've developed a device that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch cell function to rescue failing </v>

2323
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 2>body functions with a single touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The technology known as tissue nano.</v>

2324
01:42:15.371 --> 01:42:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Transfection injects genetic code into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the skin cells,</v>

2325
01:42:20.351 --> 01:42:21.184
<v Speaker 2>turning those skin cells into other </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of sales required for treating </v>

2326
01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:28.480
<v Speaker 2>disease conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the future motherfucker.</v>

2327
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Cte out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FootbAll,</v>

2328
01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:31.294
<v Speaker 2>no helmets don't be a pussy stitching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a bunch of boxes of these </v>

2329
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:38.763
<v Speaker 2>ships sitting by and you're down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your head smashed in like that fucking </v>

2330
01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:42.874
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mountain from a game of thrones </v>

2331
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:44.704
<v Speaker 2>crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just stick that shit on your </v>

2332
01:42:46.751 --> 01:42:48.510
<v Speaker 2>eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop right back in place.</v>

2333
01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.353
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2334
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:52.990
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens then?</v>

2335
01:42:53.770 --> 01:42:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Sword fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:59.080
<v Speaker 2>once they could just grab a hold of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bring you back to light,</v>

2337
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:01.300
<v Speaker 2>it'S going to be a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he had stabbed,</v>

2338
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:02.743
<v Speaker 2>her sword fights would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to cut their head </v>

2339
01:43:04.631 --> 01:43:06.100
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't fix,</v>

2340
01:43:06.110 --> 01:43:06.943
<v Speaker 2>I can't fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like elbows to the back of the </v>

2341
01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:10.270
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got the back mountain,</v>

2342
01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.840
<v Speaker 2>two effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within one week,</v>

2343
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:14.674
<v Speaker 2>active Blood vessels appeared in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured leg and by the second week the </v>

2344
01:43:18.071 --> 01:43:19.540
<v Speaker 2>leg was saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shiT.</v>

2345
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 2>We researchers studied mice and pigs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these experiments in the study,</v>

2346
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:24.123
<v Speaker 2>researchers were able to reprogram skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells to become vascular cells in badly </v>

2347
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.863
<v Speaker 2>injured legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That lacked blood flow so amazing </v>

2348
01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:31.954
<v Speaker 2>probably for people that diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing for people that are suffering </v>

2349
01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 2>from all sorts of circulatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>

2350
01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.333
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes less than a second and the </v>

2351
01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.550
<v Speaker 2>noninvasive.</v>

2352
01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

2353
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the new world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that nas song.</v>

2354
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.080
<v Speaker 2>The chip doesn't even stay in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think says they can fixing shit.</v>

2355
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.560
<v Speaker 2>why isn't this bigger news?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't this on cnn?</v>

2356
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.700
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2357
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.510
<v Speaker 2>They're too busy talking about trump or </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat.</v>

2358
01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:00.773
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is a racist and whether or not </v>

2359
01:44:02.391 --> 01:44:06.920
<v Speaker 2>that girl should get fired instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>excitement.</v>

2360
01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.080
<v Speaker 2>woo hoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a how's that?</v>

2361
01:44:09.081 --> 01:44:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Not exciting as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting.</v>

2362
01:44:11.001 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go bash mY brains in.</v>

2363
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.660
<v Speaker 2>We're in the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2364
01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:16.550
<v Speaker 2>and this is just one step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2365
01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.980
<v Speaker 2>What is this going to be like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20.</v>

2366
01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:20.140
<v Speaker 2>We didn'T see this comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it going to be like 20 years from</v>

2367
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.010
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know who's in Austria right now</v>

2368
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 2>and some fucking laboratory with white </v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves on.</v>

2369
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Huge brands putting their hand into some</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy machine.</v>

2370
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:27.643
<v Speaker 2>There's a petri dish and they got all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these lasers are zap and this thing and </v>

2371
01:44:30.211 --> 01:44:32.890
<v Speaker 2>they're poodles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck they're doing right now?</v>

2372
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:34.860
<v Speaker 2>What's a bummer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the first I've heard about.</v>

2373
01:44:34.861 --> 01:44:35.694
<v Speaker 2>Do you fucking brought it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the balls on popham stag sent me </v>

2374
01:44:39.711 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to matt stacks.</v>

2375
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

2376
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:44.330
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2377
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.750
<v Speaker 2>this whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're experiencing now is this,</v>

2378
01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.020
<v Speaker 2>you know this I'm escalating sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological race,</v>

2379
01:44:53.181 --> 01:44:58.040
<v Speaker 2>like one invention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is going to allow for the idea</v>

2380
01:44:58.041 --> 01:44:58.874
<v Speaker 2>of several other different inventions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they'll come up with </v>

2381
01:45:00.981 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They add this to crispr.</v>

2382
01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Crispr is this new genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprogramming.</v>

2383
01:45:06.771 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the best way to describe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2384
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:13.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tool for altering genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they get a hold of that and they use</v>

2385
01:45:13.971 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you use crispr and this.</v>

2386
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 2>You got the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got John Jones and brock lesnar,</v>

2387
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:21.080
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got the hulk.</v>

2388
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Fuck jon jones and brock lesnar for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hulk shows up,</v>

2389
01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not if they had a baby crashing through </v>

2390
01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:28.994
<v Speaker 2>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He leaps through the marine albert </v>

2391
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 2>nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally from the dressIng room,</v>

2392
01:45:33.741 --> 01:45:38.741
<v Speaker 2>beliefs through the air and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the center of the octagon it goes and</v>

2393
01:45:40.521 --> 01:45:42.700
<v Speaker 2>brock lesnar just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2394
01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.153
<v Speaker 2>That was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the hulk grabs that fucking thor's </v>

2395
01:45:46.671 --> 01:45:49.070
<v Speaker 2>brother and these like,</v>

2509
01:51:41.351 --> 01:51:42.850
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genetics,</v>

2510
01:51:43.570 --> 01:51:44.403
<v Speaker 3>they'd be the most insane genetics I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen and I'd be willing to bet my </v>

2511
01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:49.330
<v Speaker 3>life on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has something run through the system,</v>

2512
01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:53.110
<v Speaker 3>but is it possible to be built like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with nothing else?</v>

2513
01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.660
<v Speaker 3>Then genetics and hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think,</v>

2514
01:51:55.661 --> 01:51:56.610
<v Speaker 3>joe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

2516
01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.610

<v Speaker 3>I want to say no,</v>

2517
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.280
<v Speaker 3>but I think that tyron woodley could </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably look like that.</v>

2518
01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Like I six four sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean like the height.</v>

2519
01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:08.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean if tyron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be looking at like tyrons body </v>

2520
01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.440
<v Speaker 3>checked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like naturally jack,</v>

2521
01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:15.850
<v Speaker 3>like dave's superior genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look is jack's on the left though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2523
01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.340
<v Speaker 3>So he wasn't born like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know whaT I'm saying to.</v>

2524
01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 3>he's made that partying back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at any picture of woodley.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Average jack jack it everyday and be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ghana.</v>

2526

<v Speaker 3>There's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have such weird mentioning </v>

2527
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.430
<v Speaker 3>all black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>positive blah blah blah blah blah blah.</v>

2529
01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:40.690
<v Speaker 3>But there's got to be natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilders that are jacked.</v>

2530
01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:41.930
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2531
01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.913
<v Speaker 3>I know one day Brian Frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine from boston who was a </v>

01:52:45.531 --> 01:52:49.040
<v Speaker 3>stand up comedian who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was huge,</v>

2533

01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:52.820
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't that tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like maybe,</v>

2535
01:52:53.490 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 3>I think he's five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 or 5:11,</v>

2536
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.270

<v Speaker 3>super jacked like giant muscles.</v>

2537
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:01.960
<v Speaker 3>And I know for a fact he never did </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that he didn't.</v>

2538
01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>

2540
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:07.610

<v Speaker 3>but like I know in natural bodybuilding,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but those zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're like looking at their,</v>

01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:49.684
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2672
01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.190

<v Speaker 3>That mouse?</v>

2673
01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.010
<v Speaker 3>that's a metaphor for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2674
01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:54.613
<v Speaker 3>picture the zebra stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are designed so that align has a </v>

2675
01:58:57.971 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Speaker 3>hard time picking out one individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

2676
01:59:00.610 --> 01:59:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Is that why they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always together and to hurt.</v>

2677
01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:04.003
<v Speaker 3>You can't tell if you look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wondered that because to me </v>

2678
01:59:05.531 --> 01:59:08.080
<v Speaker 3>they would stick out being black and </v>
<v Speaker 3>white and the goddamn desert,</v>

2679
01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.930
<v Speaker 3>no africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things they did.</v>

2680
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:15.550
<v Speaker 3>They put a collar on a zebra to track </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and every tIme they would do it,</v>

2681
01:59:15.610 --> 01:59:19.420
<v Speaker 3>that was zero get killed because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see it because they could see it.</v>

2682
01:59:19.421 --> 01:59:21.070
<v Speaker 3>It would stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that color.</v>

2683
01:59:21.071 --> 01:59:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that there's a pattern that they use</v>

2684
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:29.530
<v Speaker 3>for cammo that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a company called firstlight.</v>

2685
01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 3>They make like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the best,</v>

2686
01:59:32.531 --> 01:59:33.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2687
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.380
<v Speaker 3>hunting gears in the world.</v>

2688
01:59:35.410 --> 01:59:36.243
<v Speaker 3>It's like they make this really fine </v>
<v Speaker 3>merino wool clothes that they put </v>

2689
01:59:39.701 --> 01:59:42.670
<v Speaker 3>camomile patterns on and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you sweat and merino wool,</v>

2690
01:59:42.671 --> 01:59:44.380
<v Speaker 3>it's like really good because you never </v>
<v Speaker 3>get cold.</v>

2691
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 3>It keeps your body says it's a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber,</v>

2692
01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:50.890
<v Speaker 3>but anyway they have this a one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pattern they use called asap,</v>

2693
01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.140
<v Speaker 3>a s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a t all season,</v>

2694
01:59:53.141 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 3>all terrain and in a way it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mimics what you see in a zebra.</v>

2695
01:59:58.210 --> 01:59:59.043
<v Speaker 3>So like what a zebra is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't make out the outline now </v>

2696
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:03.130
<v Speaker 3>because there's the blacks and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whites.</v>

2697
02:00:03.131 --> 02:00:03.964
<v Speaker 3>The contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have a hard time for an </v>

2698
02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:06.844
<v Speaker 3>animal in this camp was black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This campbell's got a few different </v>

2699
02:00:09.251 --> 02:00:10.084
<v Speaker 3>shades in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea behind the invention of </v>

2700
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:12.574
<v Speaker 3>this camp I was working one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras like most camel's back in the </v>

2701
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.533
<v Speaker 3>day used to be either like army shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>like vagina or they would be like </v>

2702
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.030
<v Speaker 3>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like actual leaves.</v>

2703
02:00:22.130 --> 02:00:22.963
<v Speaker 3>A lot of companies started making like </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it looks like photo realistic </v>

2704
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:26.703
<v Speaker 3>trees and patterns and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which kind of works kind of the whole </v>

2705
02:00:29.651 --> 02:00:30.700
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's asap.</v>

2706
02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.450
<v Speaker 3>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how that is like it breaks up,</v>

2707
02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:38.530
<v Speaker 3>looks like you go up right up there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jacket.</v>

2708
02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:40.000
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The jacket right there.</v>

2709
02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a kind of a ghillie suit.</v>

2710
02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.033
<v Speaker 3>What has all this extra phrase to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would use that if you were </v>

2711
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 3>hunting turkeys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because turkeys can see real good.</v>

2712
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 3>But when you're wearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that all those stripes break</v>

2713
02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:58.190
<v Speaker 3>up your outline that say the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why a zebra has that shit.</v>

2714
02:00:58.301 --> 02:00:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted that.</v>

2715
02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted it to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So have you seen the new uh,</v>

2716
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>body suits doing the water for sharks?</v>

2717
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:06.850
<v Speaker 3>So they have the suits?</v>

2718
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen those?</v>

2719
02:01:08.710 --> 02:01:09.543
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying so there's sharks can't </v>

2720
02:01:10.631 --> 02:01:13.630
<v Speaker 3>see your electrical signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know it's for sharks that.</v>

2721
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:16.450
<v Speaker 3>So they don't think you're a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2722
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:20.200
<v Speaker 3>what does it do as a different color?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I would love people.</v>

2736
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hex suit.</v>

2737
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:56.743
<v Speaker 3>I would love people to tell me whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not this really works because </v>

2738
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.673
<v Speaker 3>apparently your body is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit some sort of electric electrical </v>

2739
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:04.814
<v Speaker 3>signal.</v>

2740
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 3>And if you run your body over thiS </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2741
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:09.763
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it registers your body's electrical </v>

2742
02:02:11.841 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 3>signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you put this heck suit on and run</v>

2743
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:16.760
<v Speaker 3>your body over this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't register.</v>

2744
02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 3>So that prove that it's really working </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you guys.</v>

2745
02:02:19.110 --> 02:02:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkeys.</v>

2746
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:22.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that guys in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2747
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:26.600
<v Speaker 3>but it works apparently like noticeably </v>
<v Speaker 3>works in the water.</v>

2748
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Like this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing here,</v>

2749
02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.880
<v Speaker 3>he's just fucking day run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2750
02:02:31.881 --> 02:02:32.541
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2751
02:02:32.541 --> 02:02:33.374
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to get the fuck away from you </v>

2752
02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.653
<v Speaker 3>with this heck suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've shown the difference between </v>

2753
02:02:36.771 --> 02:02:41.030
<v Speaker 3>wearing it and not wearing it and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to see this I'm not impressed with</v>

2754
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.880
<v Speaker 3>because he's about to shoot this animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that animal can't see them.</v>

2755
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.313
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do that with like clothes on if </v>

2756
02:02:47.001 --> 02:02:49.130
<v Speaker 3>the animal can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>

2757
02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the animal doesn't see you.</v>

2758
02:02:50.601 --> 02:02:52.610
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if the animal sees you,</v>

2759
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:53.444
<v Speaker 3>the idea is that this heck suit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to somehow or another to </v>

2760
02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:55.963
<v Speaker 3>protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't have shown that one </v>

2761
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.823
<v Speaker 3>because that video didn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you couldn't see that the </v>

2762
02:03:01.251 --> 02:03:03.710
<v Speaker 3>animal was looking his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting though.</v>

2763
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:07.340
<v Speaker 3>See the shows like see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back a little bit.</v>

2764
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.420
<v Speaker 3>So watch it shows when they walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2765
02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you just had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just leave it alone.</v>

2766
02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Go back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda watch.</v>

2767
02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:21.020
<v Speaker 3>See he's passing in front of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>without hex you see how it registers now</v>

2768
02:03:21.021 --> 02:03:21.854
<v Speaker 3>with the heck suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It registers very little and this is </v>

2769
02:03:25.071 --> 02:03:27.100
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another supposed to be red,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red.</v>

2770
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Recognizing the electrical signal that </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body has to so bad because you get,</v>

2771
02:03:34.090 --> 02:03:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you get your piss on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm pissed off.</v>

2772
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:37.070
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't impress me.</v>

2773
02:03:37.071 --> 02:03:39.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking armadillo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Husqvarna romberg's test.</v>

2774
02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:40.940
<v Speaker 3>Anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anyone that has one?</v>

2775
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.850
<v Speaker 3>John dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believes in it.</v>

2776
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:44.684
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm curious about it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much there's John </v>

2777
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Dudley right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heck's testimonial.</v>

2778
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know how much science is </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>

2779
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:57.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of times you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that things work and I think you</v>

2780
02:03:57.971 --> 02:04:00.200
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works with coyotes too.</v>

2781
02:04:00.201 --> 02:04:01.034
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedies like walk right up to people </v>

2782
02:04:02.571 --> 02:04:03.404
<v Speaker 3>that are wearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that animals might have </v>

2783
02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:10.460
<v Speaker 3>certain sensors and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>detect signals that you give off that we</v>

2784
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:13.130
<v Speaker 3>just don't possess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because we don't possess those,</v>

2785
02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.830
<v Speaker 3>those abilities to recognize those </v>
<v Speaker 3>signals,</v>

2786
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:16.723
<v Speaker 3>we don't recognize that these animals do</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't think of it as an </v>

2787
02:04:19.071 --> 02:04:22.910
<v Speaker 3>option and what they're saying is it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible,</v>

2788
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:24.013
<v Speaker 3>especially with predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently entirely possible that </v>

2789
02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:31.310
<v Speaker 3>animals emit some sort of an electrical </v>
<v Speaker 3>signal that animals are attracted to.</v>

2790
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 3>And then when they see this person </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing this heck suit,</v>

2791
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 3>those signals don't come through and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what the fuck you are,</v>

2792
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.660
<v Speaker 3>which is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See electromagnetic signal,</v>

2793
02:04:42.661 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it's saying?</v>

2794
02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.393
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of it is real </v>

2795
02:04:47.281 --> 02:04:49.230
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've never,</v>

2796
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:52.230
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a study on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have studies on this.</v>

2797
02:04:52.670 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go up there,</v>

2798
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.010
<v Speaker 3>when it says proof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they have a proof thing?</v>

2799
02:04:56.370 --> 02:04:58.260
<v Speaker 3>If you go to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how it works.</v>

2800
02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does it work?</v>

2801
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.260
<v Speaker 3>That's where I'm looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no like,</v>

2802
02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:02.153
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See I feel like hex blocks you </v>

2803
02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:07.760
<v Speaker 3>electrical signal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2804
02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Seems to block that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think the real question to me is do</v>

2805
02:05:12.871 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>the animal see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done an extensive,</v>

2806
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.790
<v Speaker 3>extensive studies on what animals do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't see as far as camouflage.</v>

2807
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the ways they've done</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and what kind of light they see.</v>

2808
02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:25.433
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways they've done that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>through like they have like deer farms </v>

2809
02:05:27.781 --> 02:05:28.614
<v Speaker 3>where they have undulates in captivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they feed them and they only feed </v>

2810
02:05:31.651 --> 02:05:35.370
<v Speaker 3>them if they can see certain things so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they show them certain things and that's</v>

2811
02:05:35.371 --> 02:05:36.204
<v Speaker 3>how they measure whether or not they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually able to recognize patterns </v>

2812
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 3>because some patterns are really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some patterns just completely break</v>

2813
02:05:45.451 --> 02:05:46.284
<v Speaker 3>up the outline of a person to an animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the animal just see some weird shit </v>

2814
02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:54.780
<v Speaker 3>that looks like a bush size of the mesh </v>
<v Speaker 3>is crucial to effectively blogging,</v>

2815
02:05:54.781 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 3>humility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faraday cages,</v>

2816
02:05:56.161 --> 02:05:56.994
<v Speaker 3>what it's explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the part I was just kind of </v>

2817
02:05:58.581 --> 02:06:02.190
<v Speaker 3>look looking at this as the science </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented in 1836,</v>

2818
02:06:02.191 --> 02:06:07.191
<v Speaker 3>so just before a dude invented </v>
<v Speaker 3>chiropractor by an english scientist,</v>

2819
02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:08.580
<v Speaker 3>michael faraday.</v>

2820
02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:09.573
<v Speaker 3>A faraday cage is an enclosure made out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a conductive mesh material that </v>

2821
02:06:12.841 --> 02:06:13.674
<v Speaker 3>blocks electrical fields by channeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>the electricity through the mesh to use </v>

2822
02:06:17.311 --> 02:06:19.260
<v Speaker 3>to protect electronic equipment from </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting,</v>

2823
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:24.180
<v Speaker 3>lightening strikes or in screen rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which allows for environments to be free</v>

2824
02:06:24.181 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 3>of electromagnetic interference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2825
02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:29.910
<v Speaker 3>What I don't know is whether or not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal can see that.</v>

2826
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2827
02:06:32.170 --> 02:06:33.450
<v Speaker 3>couldn't look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you google?</v>

2828
02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:38.690
<v Speaker 3>CAn animals detect electrical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that energy,</v>

2829
02:06:39.381 --> 02:06:42.900
<v Speaker 3>that's why it shows those flocks of </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds floating around.</v>

2830
02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:48.140
<v Speaker 3>From what I've read science things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they're communicating through</v>

2831
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:50.490
<v Speaker 3>electric schools of fish or magnetism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magnets,</v>

2832
02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.140
<v Speaker 3>magnetic waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Electromagnetic waves is what?</v>

2833
02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:54.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it only makes sense if you watch </v>

2834
02:06:55.021 --> 02:06:59.190
<v Speaker 3>those giant flocks of birds all flowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

2835
02:06:59.191 --> 02:07:00.024
<v Speaker 3>that they have some sort of way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interacting with each other that we </v>

2836
02:07:01.891 --> 02:07:03.690
<v Speaker 3>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it?</v>

2837
02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:05.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something going on.</v>

2838
02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no way you could ever get</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to fly through the air like that.</v>

2839
02:07:09.841 --> 02:07:10.674
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people that said they've </v>

2840
02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:12.623
<v Speaker 3>taken like the god dose mushrooms can </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it when they're like all fucked up </v>

2841
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:16.053
<v Speaker 3>on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can see magnetic waves coming in </v>

2842
02:07:17.461 --> 02:07:20.430
<v Speaker 3>off waves and I've never been there.</v>

2843
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>

2844
02:07:22.091 --> 02:07:22.891
<v Speaker 1>I took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

2845
02:07:22.891 --> 02:07:24.940
<v Speaker 1>That was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was not a piss,</v>

2846
02:07:24.941 --> 02:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

2847

2884
02:08:52.701 --> 02:08:54.760
<v Speaker 1>probably a good idea to keep a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they do that and then they can just </v>

3076
02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:02.434
<v Speaker 2>do it like people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cops have tried to look in people's </v>

3077
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:04.984
<v Speaker 2>phones before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've told people to see if they're </v>

3078
02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:07.594
<v Speaker 2>texting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're allowed to put your finger on </v>

3079
02:17:09.761 --> 02:17:10.594
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

3080
02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

3081
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not allowed to enter your </v>
<v Speaker 2>password then.</v>

3082
02:17:13.901 --> 02:17:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Not allowed for you to ask what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>password is.</v>

3083
02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:17.493
<v Speaker 2>That's why they'd say for people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should not use the fingerprint part </v>

3084
02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:22.953
<v Speaker 2>because cops can actually actively use </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's not specifically stated </v>

3085
02:17:26.670 --> 02:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>like you're not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3086
02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:29.373
<v Speaker 2>Lupo not allowed to tell someone you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want their password because that's an </v>

3087
02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:36.400
<v Speaker 2>invasion of privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are allowed to take their finger and</v>

3088
02:17:36.401 --> 02:17:39.070
<v Speaker 2>put it on their phone and open their </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone up.</v>

3089
02:17:39.310 --> 02:17:41.350
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3090
02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:46.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like technology moving too fast and</v>

3091
02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:50.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the words in the language </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3092
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.943
<v Speaker 2>you know the preparatIons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're deal with it yet new system </v>

3093
02:17:54.161 --> 02:17:58.210
<v Speaker 2>built into the ios 11 which comes out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days.</v>

3094
02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.410
<v Speaker 2>That allows you to bypass that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick tap five times.</v>

3095
02:18:02.650 --> 02:18:03.483
<v Speaker 2>You can turn off touch id basically is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're calling it as a cop to </v>

3096
02:18:08.090 --> 02:18:13.090
<v Speaker 2>count one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

3097
02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:16.100
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One shit?</v>

3098
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that's the way to go.</v>

3099
02:18:20.831 --> 02:18:23.890
<v Speaker 2>The facial recognition thing just seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>corny.</v>

3100
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I gotta do this every time I want to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3101
02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:28.473
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just put my fucking dumb on </v>

3102
02:18:30.761 --> 02:18:31.510
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is.</v>

3103
02:18:31.510 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cons can't fIgure out a way to get</v>

3104
02:18:34.121 --> 02:18:36.790
<v Speaker 2>your fingerprint right off your phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet right off the main screen.</v>

3105
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:38.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what they've been working on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

3106
02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get on the big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3107
02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:42.580
<v Speaker 2>so you just touch anywhere on the screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it picks up your fingerprint.</v>

3108
02:18:42.610 --> 02:18:44.380
<v Speaker 2>That's what they've been working on </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

3109
02:18:44.410 --> 02:18:47.230
<v Speaker 2>They do not have that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they went with facial recognition,</v>

3110
02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:48.213
<v Speaker 2>which they've already had for snapchat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for instagram filters and all those </v>

3111
02:18:50.981 --> 02:18:51.814
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really see your face and then turn you </v>

3112
02:18:53.051 --> 02:18:55.600
<v Speaker 2>into abraham lincoln or some shit way </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than those,</v>

3113
02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:57.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's an acceleration of that.</v>

3114
02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:58.653
<v Speaker 2>Would they have been able to do is get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole screen to be a fingerprint </v>

3115
02:19:01.361 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 2>sensor and still be able to show images </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>

3116
02:19:03.850 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Got something like six film selfie </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras,</v>

3117
02:19:06.011 --> 02:19:10.060
<v Speaker 2>ones like thoughts like the camera was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

3118
02:19:10.061 --> 02:19:10.894
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connect with the self is the camera </v>

3119
02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:17.260
<v Speaker 2>industry just doesn't just tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're useless.</v>

3120
02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Last time you saw like a straight up </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

3121
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Well you'd have to be like a guy was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>photographer like jamie.</v>

3122
02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Then you carry those goofy brIcks </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want to impress chicks.</v>

3123
02:19:26.890 --> 02:19:27.723
<v Speaker 2>You whAt he's doing is just take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of the sheriff's autologist </v>

3124
02:19:29.590 --> 02:19:31.460

<v Speaker 2>But even at that they like to pose.</v>

3126
02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:39.513
<v Speaker 5>Did they go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see them all the time that they </v>

3127
02:19:40.721 --> 02:19:44.870
<v Speaker 5>just go on like little photo shoot dates</v>

3130
02:19:46.871 --> 02:19:49.210

<v Speaker 2>Fat went through his bloodstream somehow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his body locked up and that's a wrap</v>

3185
02:22:10.930 --> 02:22:13.030

<v Speaker 3>And he did some movie but apparently </v>

3305
02:27:50.050 --> 02:27:54.640
<v Speaker 3>stolen straight up from Roger Avery did </v>
<v Speaker 3>his bit.</v>

3306
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Roger avery had mapped it all out.</v>

3307
02:27:56.890 --> 02:27:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And did it in a movie.</v>

3310
02:28:02.050 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Did it in a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

02:28:03.581 --> 02:28:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3312
02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:06.460
<v Speaker 3>That's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the roger,</v>

3313
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:10.780
<v Speaker 3>every movie killing zoe is with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl julie delpy and it's excellent.</v>

3314
02:28:10.781 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy like drama drama,</v>

3315
02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:17.350
<v Speaker 3>a crime drama movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to quinten tino?</v>

<v Speaker 3>can't miss.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kills it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3318
02:28:21.201 --> 02:28:22.034
<v Speaker 3>It's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when you hear that he stole roger </v>

3319
02:28:23.241 --> 02:28:24.074
<v Speaker 3>avery's topcon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I would like to hear his story </v>

3320
02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.713
<v Speaker 3>like maybe Roger Avery says he stole up </v>
<v Speaker 3>be him and clinton and Roger Avery came </v>

3321
02:28:30.261 --> 02:28:31.940
<v Speaker 3>up with it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're drunk.</v>

3322
02:28:31.941 --> 02:28:33.680
<v Speaker 3>LIke going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3323
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe quintin just wrapped.</v>

3324
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:38.310
<v Speaker 3>But I know people have done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug stanhope is,</v>

3325
02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.153
<v Speaker 3>had a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has guys opening with him and he'll be </v>

3326
02:28:41.931 --> 02:28:42.440
<v Speaker 3>on the road.</v>

3327
02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:46.670
<v Speaker 3>They'll go to a diner and he dug a be </v>
<v Speaker 3>riffing about something and they will do</v>

3328
02:28:46.671 --> 02:28:49.640
<v Speaker 3>it on stage the next day because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think it's a bit.</v>

3329
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:50.503
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're getting in under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wire terantin here and screenwriter </v>

3330
02:28:53.631 --> 02:28:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Roger Avery with tumi pen pall fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I said.</v>

3331
02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:59.660
<v Speaker 3>It says this was originally written.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3332
02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:01.093
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's see if he says that for a </v>

3333
02:29:03.681 --> 02:29:06.440
<v Speaker 3>separate feature while it's compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The theory,</v>

3334
02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:07.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona one.</v>

3335
02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this the thing about him stealing it?</v>

3336
02:29:09.490 --> 02:29:10.323
<v Speaker 3>This is just about the theory itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this mentioned is him them </v>

3337
02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:15.650
<v Speaker 3>together writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it's compelling,</v>

3338
02:29:15.651 --> 02:29:16.484
<v Speaker 3>the theory airs on one key aspect of duo</v>
<v Speaker 3>argue that top gun is subversion on a </v>

3339
02:29:21.381 --> 02:29:22.214
<v Speaker 3>mass level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tony scott did not set out to make </v>

3340
02:29:24.561 --> 02:29:25.394
<v Speaker 3>starship troopers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much of it's homo eroticism was </v>

3341
02:29:27.711 --> 02:29:29.600
<v Speaker 3>happenstance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>OkaY.</v>

3342
02:29:31.690 --> 02:29:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just showing you today and said that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wrote it together here in this.</v>

3343
02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Find out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that find out if that's true.</v>

3344
02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.413
<v Speaker 3>Like find out if a Roger Avery says </v>
<v Speaker 3>quintin tarantino stole that idea from </v>

3345
02:29:43.011 --> 02:29:43.791
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stay on hold.</v>

3346
02:29:43.791 --> 02:29:46.340
<v Speaker 3>we'll be at a restaurant just hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3347
02:29:46.341 --> 02:29:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Riffing has a couple of cocktails in.</v>

3348
02:29:48.601 --> 02:29:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm riffing with his opening acts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a long time ago,</v>

3349
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:52.423
<v Speaker 3>but he had a real issue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those guys would wind up doing his </v>

3350
02:29:56.211 --> 02:29:57.044
<v Speaker 3>riffs on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was thorough and I don't think </v>

3351
02:29:59.541 --> 02:30:01.960
<v Speaker 3>you've wanted to say anything to him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was all pissed off.</v>

3352
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>

3353
02:30:03.051 --> 02:30:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't even ran around you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

3354
02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Because that's like unspoken shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even unspoken.</v>

3355
02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:11.360
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's stealing.</v>

3356
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:14.780
<v Speaker 3>That's still ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3357
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And a guy like stan hope rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3358
02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:18.073
<v Speaker 3>that's how he formulates ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He bounces them off friends if he can't </v>

3359
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:24.050
<v Speaker 3>bounce them off you because you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with shit.</v>

3360
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:26.480
<v Speaker 3>And its concepts does happen though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3361
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:31.760
<v Speaker 3>sometimes even this day and age though </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you found out so fast.</v>

3362
02:30:31.761 --> 02:30:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like John Jones,</v>

3363
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.440
<v Speaker 3>people still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People still cheap.</v>

3364
02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:38.053
<v Speaker 3>They try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he caught them comment with comedy </v>

3365
02:30:40.580 --> 02:30:41.413
<v Speaker 3>hanging out in the back and you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something funny and then a week goes by </v>

3366
02:30:44.751 --> 02:30:47.030
<v Speaker 3>and some guy goes up and does the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you said.</v>

3367
02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Comedy comedy Is way easier to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with and say cheating with steroids.</v>

3368
02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:53.780
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

3369
02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:56.240
<v Speaker 3>The thing with steroids is you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>test it,</v>

3370
02:30:56.241 --> 02:30:57.680
<v Speaker 3>but the thing with comedy is you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3371
02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.880
<v Speaker 3>I thought of it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

3372
02:30:58.881 --> 02:31:01.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well top gun does seem gay.</v>

3373
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3374
02:31:02.991 --> 02:31:05.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean val kilmer's faces all sweaty and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaven.</v>

3375
02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:07.093
<v Speaker 3>He's goT this like gay fuck boy haircut </v>
<v Speaker 3>and him and tom cruise looking at each </v>

3376
02:31:10.071 --> 02:31:10.904
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom cruise gets mad rides off when it's </v>

3377
02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:13.550
<v Speaker 3>motorbike because he's dangerous.</v>

3378
02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buttfuck.</v>

3379
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:16.280
<v Speaker 3>OkaY.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah they do,</v>

3380
02:31:16.370 --> 02:31:19.380
<v Speaker 3>but fuck crazy care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of slippery,</v>

3381
02:31:19.381 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 3>shiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smooth face.</v>

3382
02:31:20.641 --> 02:31:22.500
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of the shower with a towel </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3383
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:25.190
<v Speaker 3>looking at each other's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Play volleyball and yeah,</v>

3384
02:31:25.530 --> 02:31:26.363
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not out of the possibilities</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could come up with that too if </v>

3385
02:31:31.351 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 3>you just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>

3386
02:31:32.431 --> 02:31:35.550
<v Speaker 3>yo dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it me or is this a gay movie?</v>

3387
02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:40.230
<v Speaker 3>You can totally see you saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a total credit shaoguan.</v>

3388
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like it is book the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck of woods?</v>

3389
02:31:44.581 --> 02:31:45.414
<v Speaker 3>A woman's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the woman who plays is a girl </v>

3390
02:31:47.221 --> 02:31:48.054
<v Speaker 3>kelly something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Press plays places a female love </v>

3391
02:31:50.401 --> 02:31:52.350
<v Speaker 3>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was probably like,</v>

3392
02:31:52.351 --> 02:31:54.500
<v Speaker 3>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck me,</v>

3393
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:57.060
<v Speaker 3>goddamn sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wrote it?</v>

3394
02:31:57.390 --> 02:31:57.991
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3395
02:31:57.991 --> 02:32:00.030
<v Speaker 3>the gay boy in the corner of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally like,</v>

3396
02:32:00.031 --> 02:32:00.690
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

3397
02:32:00.690 --> 02:32:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Like he's struggling with his true </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature.</v>

3398
02:32:02.371 --> 02:32:04.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's something that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>could come up with.</v>

3399
02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:05.633
<v Speaker 3>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did roger ever come up with it and did </v>

3400
02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:10.380
<v Speaker 3>quintin tenant terentino's steal it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't.</v>

3401
02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:11.214
<v Speaker 3>Quintin tarantino has been accused </v>
<v Speaker 3>before of using the plotlines from a </v>

3402
02:32:14.701 --> 02:32:17.610
<v Speaker 3>bunch of real classic japanese movies </v>
<v Speaker 3>for his films.</v>

3403
02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3404
02:32:18.661 --> 02:32:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3405
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:22.410
<v Speaker 3>the hateful eight and sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that one,</v>

3406
02:32:22.530 --> 02:32:27.530
<v Speaker 3>but I think that was the thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reservoir dogs.</v>

3407
02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:28.663
<v Speaker 3>I think reservoir dogs was essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like a tribute of a classic </v>

3408
02:32:32.191 --> 02:32:34.020
<v Speaker 3>japanese gangster moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3409
02:32:34.021 --> 02:32:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3410
02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:36.433
<v Speaker 3>See if that's true when you would like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to other people googling concepts for </v>

3411
02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:40.493
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes a lot of whatever influences </v>

3412
02:32:42.271 --> 02:32:44.970
<v Speaker 3>he'll call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like direct steam scene,</v>

3413
02:32:44.971 --> 02:32:45.804
<v Speaker 3>stealing or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is why someone would probably </v>

3414
02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:49.610
<v Speaker 3>accuse him of doing this with the roger </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything online.</v>

3415
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:50.783
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see rodrick go to see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could find Roger Avery tweets </v>

3416
02:32:53.461 --> 02:32:54.294
<v Speaker 3>from prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fascinating because he was in </v>

3417
02:32:56.161 --> 02:32:57.870
<v Speaker 3>jail and somehow or another he was able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tweet.</v>

3418
02:32:57.871 --> 02:32:58.704
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how he's pulling it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but theY found out about it after </v>

3419
02:33:00.811 --> 02:33:01.211
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

3420
02:33:01.211 --> 02:33:02.310
<v Speaker 3>candice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candice,</v>

3421
02:33:02.311 --> 02:33:04.220
<v Speaker 3>shit will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter's been around how long?</v>

3422
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven years.</v>

3423
02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eleven years.</v>

3424
02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3425
02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:15.010
<v Speaker 3>And this was at the beginning days of </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter when hardly anybody was using 20</v>

3426
02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:17.670
<v Speaker 3>pulp fiction writer tweets on life in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

3427
02:33:17.671 --> 02:33:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>January.</v>

3428
02:33:22.381 --> 02:33:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Was that say 2008 for drunk driving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3429
02:33:25.290 --> 02:33:27.690
<v Speaker 3>So he was quite a few years after it </v>
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>

3430
02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:30.073
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sickness spreads throughout the </v>

3431
02:33:31.411 --> 02:33:33.000
<v Speaker 3>facility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bush fires.</v>

3432
02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 3>It was great stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3433
02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:39.330
<v Speaker 3>I remember reading it is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting stuff.</v>

3434
02:33:39.331 --> 02:33:42.690
<v Speaker 3>So you can find it that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even think about that,</v>

3435
02:33:42.691 --> 02:33:43.524
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3436
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:46.080
<v Speaker 3>like a sickness spreading through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3437
02:33:46.081 --> 02:33:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Like a bushfire man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing poet with his word.</v>

3438
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.823
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a brilliant writer and that's why </v>

3439
02:33:53.221 --> 02:33:55.230
<v Speaker 3>that movie killings zoe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is his movie,</v>

3440
02:33:56.220 --> 02:33:57.053
<v Speaker 3>did he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else did he make or underrated </v>

3441
02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:00.180
<v Speaker 3>starship troopers and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3442
02:34:00.270 --> 02:34:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that was him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was someone else.</v>

3443
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:03.294
<v Speaker 3>They were just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeowner versus quentin tarantino's of </v>

3444
02:34:06.541 --> 02:34:07.374
<v Speaker 3>attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think was the one big one he made to </v>

3445
02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:09.240
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

3446
02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:10.110
<v Speaker 3>remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3447
02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:11.850
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of fucked up shit happening in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that movie.</v>

3448
02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:17.180
<v Speaker 3>He's got a weird mind for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to have to be beowulf.</v>

3449
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Beowulf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a crazy movie,</v>

3450
02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:21.724
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a.</v>

3451
02:34:22.010 --> 02:34:24.160
<v Speaker 3>You're watching a live video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3452
02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Bailiff is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3453

<v Speaker 3>silent hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

3454
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beowulf is like they did at cgi,</v>

3455
02:34:29.831 --> 02:34:31.690
<v Speaker 3>but not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember that?</v>

3456
02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:33.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started off as a video game,</v>

3457
02:34:33.671 --> 02:34:35.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3458
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:37.840
<v Speaker 3>this is a fable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

3459
02:34:37.841 --> 02:34:39.130
<v Speaker 3>It's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

3460
02:34:39.131 --> 02:34:44.131
<v Speaker 3>old story and they used a back when </v>
<v Speaker 3>angelina Jolie,</v>

3461
02:34:47.050 --> 02:34:52.030
<v Speaker 3>when she hypnotized brad pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got him to stop drinking.</v>

3462
02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:55.270
<v Speaker 3>AdoptIng random it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She cracked that dude.</v>

3463
02:34:55.390 --> 02:34:58.000
<v Speaker 3>She cracks them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a black widow right there.</v>

3464
02:34:58.001 --> 02:34:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billy bob thornton,</v>

3465
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:03.340
<v Speaker 3>maxim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maxim had billy bob thornton lower blood</v>

3466
02:35:03.341 --> 02:35:05.140
<v Speaker 3>around her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both were in each other's blood.</v>

3467
02:35:05.290 --> 02:35:06.101
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3468
02:35:06.101 --> 02:35:07.480
<v Speaker 3>She was reading them back then.</v>

3469
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:10.320
<v Speaker 3>It was just too powerful and attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those lips too.</v>

3470
02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That world out of the world.</v>

3471
02:35:13.810 --> 02:35:14.950
<v Speaker 3>That movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

3472
02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:17.500
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that she was the tiger and</v>
<v Speaker 3>panda.</v>

3473
02:35:18.270 --> 02:35:19.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing the game.</v>

3474
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's um,</v>

3475
02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:25.480
<v Speaker 3>the beowulf movie was fun because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like animated,</v>

3476
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:28.420
<v Speaker 3>but like they used people's faces so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like kind of close.</v>

3477
02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:30.250
<v Speaker 3>But you knew it wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real weird.</v>

3478
02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:31.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you could pull that off </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3479
02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:33.300
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3480
02:35:33.780 --> 02:35:34.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fun movie.</v>

3481
02:35:35.010 --> 02:35:36.550
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that movie.</v>

3482
02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avatars a little bit of that now because</v>

3483
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.350
<v Speaker 3>avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people look like people.</v>

3484
02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:43.010
<v Speaker 3>And this will be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody looks like a person.</v>

3485
02:35:43.011 --> 02:35:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the avatars look,</v>

3486
02:35:44.471 --> 02:35:48.400
<v Speaker 3>they do look like aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still have the same kind of cci</v>

3487
02:35:48.430 --> 02:35:49.270
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3488
02:35:49.271 --> 02:35:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Like you can tell it's the actor.</v>

3489
02:35:51.730 --> 02:35:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3490
02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.880
<v Speaker 3>But it looks a lot better than this shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3491
02:35:54.930 --> 02:35:56.840
<v Speaker 3>That's also because it's not a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3492
02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:57.693
<v Speaker 3>that's the sneaky trick about cgi is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that cgi works best on something that's </v>

3493
02:36:01.841 --> 02:36:04.210
<v Speaker 3>not real because we have nothing to base</v>
<v Speaker 3>it off.</v>

3494
02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why cgi so bad witH animals,</v>

3495
02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.360
<v Speaker 3>like when you see like those wolves in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game of thrones,</v>

3496
02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not really.</v>

3497
02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Although jungle book said what up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bad.</v>

3498
02:36:15.130 --> 02:36:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty good.</v>

3499
02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting way better for sure.</v>

3500
02:36:17.771 --> 02:36:18.604
<v Speaker 3>I better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's at the edge of what they </v>

3501
02:36:20.201 --> 02:36:21.034
<v Speaker 3>called the uncanny valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The uncanny valley is so like the gap </v>

3502
02:36:24.161 --> 02:36:24.994
<v Speaker 3>between something that looks hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic and something that looks </v>

3503
02:36:27.551 --> 02:36:28.570
<v Speaker 3>totally fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3504
02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:30.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like you get to this point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3505
02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:31.420
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>

3506
02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:34.060
<v Speaker 3>It's real close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he can't tell.</v>

3507
02:36:36.130 --> 02:36:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Wish I could stop clearIng my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try not to focus.</v>

3508
02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:39.790
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You getting mad?</v>

3509
02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:41.440

<v Speaker 3>it's the weed smoked weed.</v>

3510
02:36:41.441 --> 02:36:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Before this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take over shitting my pants.</v>

3588
02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:04.133
<v Speaker 3>The pec muscles are used for two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clenching your anus and controlling the </v>

3589
02:41:08.341 --> 02:41:09.174
<v Speaker 3>flow of urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you stop yourself midstream at </v>

3590
02:41:12.901 --> 02:41:15.450
<v Speaker 3>the urinal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the pec muscles at work.</v>

3591
02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:16.021
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3595
02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Women was strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pec muscles tend to have tighter,</v>

3596
02:41:27.361 --> 02:41:28.194
<v Speaker 3>stronger vaginas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which often means stronger contractions </v>

3597
02:41:31.261 --> 02:41:34.500
<v Speaker 3>during orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know anything about orgasms,</v>

3598
02:41:34.501 --> 02:41:37.740
<v Speaker 3>you know that stronger is always better </v>
<v Speaker 3>says in all caps.</v>

3599
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:39.833
<v Speaker 3>If you know anything about orgasms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a very technical way to </v>

3600
02:41:41.641 --> 02:41:43.380
<v Speaker 3>write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men on the other hand,</v>

3601
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:48.090
<v Speaker 3>use the pc muscles to stop their urine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid flow,</v>

3602
02:41:48.210 --> 02:41:49.043
<v Speaker 3>but also to stop urine from coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first place when you feel the </v>

3603
02:41:51.901 --> 02:41:52.734
<v Speaker 3>need to use the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have to hold it thanks to a long </v>

3604
02:41:56.011 --> 02:41:56.460
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

3605
02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Those are the pec muscles doIng the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

3606
02:41:58.530 --> 02:41:59.363
<v Speaker 3>so you're crunching your pec muscles so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can stop your flow of pis or you're </v>

3607

<v Speaker 3>tightening up your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3608
02:42:06.511 --> 02:42:07.344
<v Speaker 3>you will be able to clench,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop gas from passing through your </v>

3609
02:42:09.451 --> 02:42:10.284
<v Speaker 3>anus to hold your waste until you reach </v>
<v Speaker 3>the toilet and even to eliminate waste </v>

<v Speaker 3>more efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be supposed to be better at getting </v>

<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

3613

<v Speaker 3>How often is this taking place?</v>

3617
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should reconsider your diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

3618
02:42:35.601 --> 02:42:37.890
<v Speaker 3>Sit around like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>just clench your butt all day.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to do them?</v>

3622
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Like two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend started out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I still suck at it.</v>

3626
02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:58.880

02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:05.543
<v Speaker 3>Just I know I suck at it still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you know that you make it just </v>

3630
02:43:07.681 --> 02:43:10.380
<v Speaker 3>like a little bit of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a little bit of progress,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the same thing with buck eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Still running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not today.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3638
02:43:27.970 --> 02:43:28.803
<v Speaker 2>Like for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pulled tight with like a cord and </v>

3639
02:43:31.271 --> 02:43:33.620
<v Speaker 2>then slides down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The court tucks into the mouth.</v>

3640
02:43:33.621 --> 02:43:34.454
<v Speaker 2>Your shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>very easy to tighten up when you're in </v>

3641
02:43:35.261 --> 02:43:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the field out there in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enough time to issue,</v>

3642
02:43:38.410 --> 02:43:41.140

<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

3643
02:43:41.170 --> 02:43:42.003
<v Speaker 2>but I've wanted to get a real hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>running today and I have to be more </v>

3644
02:43:46.421 --> 02:43:47.254
<v Speaker 2>careful where I step when I wear those </v>
<v Speaker 2>five fingers shows I can just go </v>

3645
02:43:50.441 --> 02:43:51.850
<v Speaker 2>reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

3646
02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.890
<v Speaker 2>full out with these things on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll step anywhere.</v>

3647
02:43:53.891 --> 02:43:55.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter so he can get a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout.</v>

3648
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because with the vibrams,</v>

3649
02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.200
<v Speaker 2>if I hit a sharp rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of fucked with this.</v>

3650
02:43:59.201 --> 02:44:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even feeling that shit with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

3651
02:44:01.301 --> 02:44:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I can run over pretty much anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think for,</v>

3652
02:44:04.570 --> 02:44:09.570
<v Speaker 2>for controlling what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so close to it,</v>

3653
02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:16.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to fuck with my speedster muscles</v>

3654
02:44:17.701 --> 02:44:19.720
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it together.</v>

3655
02:44:20.010 --> 02:44:25.010
<v Speaker 2>It's your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face ready as you like jesus,</v>

3656
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you know he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what your face looks like.</v>

3657
02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:31.973
<v Speaker 2>A teacup ride at disney when you do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is spinning and kind of going too </v>

3658
02:44:35.411 --> 02:44:40.360
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh me,</v>

3659
02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:42.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't be the first to get his shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his pants,</v>

3660
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:43.833
<v Speaker 2>me and campaigns and our kids got in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them tea cup things and with me and </v>

3661
02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:52.390
<v Speaker 2>him going full clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean full clip.</v>

3662
02:44:52.391 --> 02:44:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3663
02:44:53.410 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a limitation on how fast those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things go,</v>

3664
02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:57.320
<v Speaker 2>but it ain't getting anY faster.</v>

3665
02:44:57.550 --> 02:44:59.380
<v Speaker 2>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so ridiculous.</v>

3666
02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:01.560
<v Speaker 2>We were spinning so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sick.</v>

3667
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh totally sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My youngest,</v>

3668
02:45:04.331 --> 02:45:09.331
<v Speaker 2>my seven year old is fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves to go on those things fast.</v>

3669
02:45:09.401 --> 02:45:10.234
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a carousel at the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually way faster than one at </v>

3670
02:45:12.711 --> 02:45:13.600
<v Speaker 2>disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3671
02:45:13.601 --> 02:45:14.434
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a tea cup thing on there and </v>

3672
02:45:15.431 --> 02:45:17.590
<v Speaker 2>you write down the street that the panga</v>
<v Speaker 2>mall,</v>

3673
02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:19.810
<v Speaker 2>you grabbed that fucking steering </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheels.</v>

3674
02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Just whipping around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes so fast.</v>

3675
02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Your head is like you're holding your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to use all your muscles to keep</v>

3676
02:45:26.351 --> 02:45:29.590
<v Speaker 2>your head from just bending over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you look like right here.</v>

3677
02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:30.510
<v Speaker 2>You like to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3678
02:45:30.511 --> 02:45:31.344
<v Speaker 2>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as like you're on a </v>

3679
02:45:32.291 --> 02:45:32.930
<v Speaker 2>teacup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3680
02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:36.930
<v Speaker 2>ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3681
02:45:36.940 --> 02:45:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Just stick your ass hole up with the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get on the highway.</v>

3682
02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.690
<v Speaker 2>When you come over the crest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

3683
02:45:43.691 --> 02:45:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get that big long hill.</v>

3684
02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:48.760
<v Speaker 2>just pull your pants down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift your ass in the air.</v>

3685
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll take you to paint your canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one sees me.</v>

3686
02:45:53.991 --> 02:45:54.824
<v Speaker 2>Shit that slingshot out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowan has a great story about being </v>

3687
02:45:57.411 --> 02:45:59.300
<v Speaker 2>another girl once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like many,</v>

3688
02:45:59.301 --> 02:46:00.134
<v Speaker 2>many moons ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was going on a hike with her and </v>

3689
02:46:03.531 --> 02:46:06.310
<v Speaker 2>he had a shit and so he came up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3690
02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:07.263
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear something and he like made a out </v>

3691
02:46:09.411 --> 02:46:13.070
<v Speaker 2>of it that he ran and shit and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was really funny,</v>

3692
02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's like,</v>

3693
02:46:14.391 --> 02:46:15.390
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3694
02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I heard something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought no big deal.</v>

3695
02:46:17.350 --> 02:46:18.183
<v Speaker 2>It's just making sure that we're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there were kept hiking and </v>

3696
02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:21.801
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

3697
02:46:21.801 --> 02:46:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I have to shit again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they ran away again and she's like,</v>

3698
02:46:25.161 --> 02:46:26.630
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing that she realized he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was shitting.</v>

3699
02:46:26.970 --> 02:46:30.460
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3700
02:46:30.850 --> 02:46:33.830
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is out there in the woods.</v>

3701
02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Shitting himself is just nothing you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is life.</v>

3702
02:46:42.670 --> 02:46:43.850
<v Speaker 2>It is a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3703
02:46:44.370 --> 02:46:45.203
<v Speaker 2>Like inefficiency of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like breaking everything down but not </v>

3704
02:46:49.161 --> 02:46:50.370
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it out of here.</v>

3705
02:46:50.660 --> 02:46:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Your body's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good man.</v>

3706
02:46:52.281 --> 02:46:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Get it out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if like hot lava.</v>

3707
02:46:55.770 --> 02:46:56.603
<v Speaker 2>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a good design like fishing </v>

3708
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:03.200
<v Speaker 2>animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any animal or plant is a plant.</v>

3709
02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:05.060
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the plant takes things in,</v>

3710
02:47:05.061 --> 02:47:06.860
<v Speaker 2>but the plant doesn't shit anything out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3711
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Putting it through the waist does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets rid of,</v>

3712
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:11.833
<v Speaker 2>gets rid of oxygeN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It processes carbon carbon dioxide and </v>

3713
02:47:14.511 --> 02:47:17.180
<v Speaker 2>turns it into oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not waste.</v>

3714
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:19.370
<v Speaker 2>That's like us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We breathe out carbon dioxide.</v>

3715
02:47:19.371 --> 02:47:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't necessarily say it's waste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just we're transferring.</v>

3716
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:25.730
<v Speaker 2>We're quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that carbon dioxide was in your body,</v>

3717
02:47:25.731 --> 02:47:26.564
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3718
02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:27.380
<v Speaker 2>So we're getting rid of it.</v>

3719
02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:28.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3720
02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:30.050
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You obviously you're making it.</v>

3721
02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:32.600
<v Speaker 2>You're pushing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't want to have too much.</v>

3722
02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:38.450
<v Speaker 2>But do you know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air is not really mostly oxygen.</v>

3723
02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:41.900
<v Speaker 2>do you know what most of the areas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nitrogen,</v>

3724
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:44.330
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a massive percentage of it.</v>

3725
02:47:44.331 --> 02:47:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in the high eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3726
02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Want to say 68 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3727
02:47:48.860 --> 02:47:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out what the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to turns it into carbon dioxide.</v>

3728
02:47:51.861 --> 02:47:52.694
<v Speaker 2>That's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3729
02:47:52.850 --> 02:47:54.000
<v Speaker 2>That's all they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

3730
02:47:54.010 --> 02:47:57.260
<v Speaker 2>They can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're getting out of the water</v>

3731
02:47:57.261 --> 02:47:59.810
<v Speaker 2>and out of the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to use.</v>

3732
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:03.590
<v Speaker 2>But what percentage of the air is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen?</v>

3733
02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:05.210
<v Speaker 2>I really want to say it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

3734
02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:07.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making it up.</v>

3735
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:09.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull nitrogen out of the air and </v>

3736
02:48:11.241 --> 02:48:13.310
<v Speaker 2>use it for fertilizer 78.</v>

3737
02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's high.</v>

3738
02:48:14.270 --> 02:48:16.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly nitrogen.</v>

3739
02:48:16.350 --> 02:48:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Twenty one percent oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3740
02:48:18.090 --> 02:48:21.130
<v Speaker 2>You would think of the air is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen and carbon dioxide.</v>

3741
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:25.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been taught in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all the other animals,</v>

3742
02:48:25.101 --> 02:48:25.934
<v Speaker 2>living organisms may besides plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>released the ways we do every other </v>

3743
02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:32.150
<v Speaker 2>mammal fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all do it.</v>

3744
02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.680
<v Speaker 2>You know what's crazy is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3745
02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:35.613
<v Speaker 2>there's nitrogen around us all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dude figured out how to extract </v>

3746
02:48:39.411 --> 02:48:42.920
<v Speaker 2>that nitrogen out of the air and use it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for fertilizer.</v>

3747
02:48:42.921 --> 02:48:43.754
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there's so many people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth today because a guy named </v>

3748
02:48:45.771 --> 02:48:46.604
<v Speaker 2>fritz harbor and he made something </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the harbor method of extracting </v>

3749
02:48:49.251 --> 02:48:50.084
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did iT like in world war one to genius </v>

3750
02:48:53.010 --> 02:48:56.630
<v Speaker 2>also created [inaudible] a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the shit that they used.</v>

3751
02:48:56.631 --> 02:48:57.780
<v Speaker 2>They changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3752
02:48:57.800 --> 02:48:58.633
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gassed the jews with fucking he </v>

3753
02:49:02.301 --> 02:49:03.650
<v Speaker 2>didn't mean camps.</v>

3754
02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:04.693
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made his icon a which had a scent to </v>

3755
02:49:07.321 --> 02:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they re because.</v>

3756
02:49:09.601 --> 02:49:10.434
<v Speaker 2>So you could tell what is there to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from it and they removed the sent </v>

3757
02:49:12.901 --> 02:49:15.150
<v Speaker 2>and created zyklon b and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they use,</v>

3758
02:49:15.151 --> 02:49:16.830
<v Speaker 2>the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jews and the gas chambers.</v>

3759
02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

3760
02:49:17.821 --> 02:49:20.220
<v Speaker 2>And he was jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said more fucked up.</v>

3761
02:49:20.290 --> 02:49:24.900
<v Speaker 2>So he was there during world war one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when world war was happening,</v>

3762
02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:28.680
<v Speaker 2>that's when he had to leave Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of dying of a heart attack.</v>

3763
02:49:28.681 --> 02:49:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy shit,</v>

3764
02:49:29.551 --> 02:49:30.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

3765
02:49:30.810 --> 02:49:34.470
<v Speaker 2>he was also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the nuttiest thing about harbor</v>

3766
02:49:35.370 --> 02:49:36.203
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was receiving the nobel prize for </v>

3767
02:49:39.511 --> 02:49:42.570
<v Speaker 2>creating the harbor method of extracting</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen out of the atmosphere.</v>

3768
02:49:42.571 --> 02:49:43.404
<v Speaker 2>Rightfully so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also was wanted for crimes against </v>

3769
02:49:46.441 --> 02:49:51.441
<v Speaker 2>humanity because he was gassing the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the british and canadian,</v>

3770
02:49:52.831 --> 02:49:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it was troops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they first started,</v>

3771
02:49:54.930 --> 02:49:57.780
<v Speaker 2>he was waiting for the first guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiated a gas attack.</v>

3772
02:49:57.780 --> 02:49:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

3773
02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:00.653
<v Speaker 2>So this guy that's responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nitrogen from the harbor method is </v>

3774
02:50:03.991 --> 02:50:04.824
<v Speaker 2>responsible for some insane percentage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nitrogen that's in people's </v>

3775
02:50:09.211 --> 02:50:11.220
<v Speaker 2>bodies that comes from food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the thing,</v>

3776
02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:12.063
<v Speaker 2>it's something around like half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like half of the nitrogen that you have </v>

3777
02:50:15.151 --> 02:50:15.984
<v Speaker 2>in your body from food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a direct result of them </v>

3778
02:50:18.301 --> 02:50:20.640
<v Speaker 2>extracting it out of the air with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopper method,</v>

3779
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:21.743
<v Speaker 2>which is like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the same guy that was </v>

3780
02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:29.540
<v Speaker 2>gassing allied forces and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same guy that created this icon,</v>

3781
02:50:29.790 --> 02:50:32.400
<v Speaker 2>a which eventually became zyklon b used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to gas.</v>

3782
02:50:32.401 --> 02:50:34.620
<v Speaker 2>The jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really brilliant dude,</v>

3783
02:50:34.621 --> 02:50:35.454
<v Speaker 2>but nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His wife apparently shot herself in </v>

3784
02:50:38.071 --> 02:50:38.904
<v Speaker 2>front of him because she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She disagreed with who knows what The </v>

3785
02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:42.953
<v Speaker 2>whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what he was doing and he was off to </v>

3786
02:50:44.611 --> 02:50:47.790
<v Speaker 2>war and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in front of him he shot himself.</v>

3787
02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:51.780
<v Speaker 2>He left his dying wife with his 13 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old son,</v>

3788
02:50:51.781 --> 02:50:52.614
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see I got to go to war is a terrible </v>

3789
02:50:53.731 --> 02:50:55.140
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>

3790
02:50:55.330 --> 02:50:56.163
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the actual circumstances </v>

3791
02:50:58.471 --> 02:50:59.310
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3792
02:50:59.311 --> 02:51:02.180
<v Speaker 2>like I guess you'd have to get like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the variables are what,</v>

3793
02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:04.950
<v Speaker 2>why he left the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might have had other people to watch out</v>

3794
02:51:04.951 --> 02:51:05.620
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't.</v>

3795
02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:06.453
<v Speaker 2>He had no option other than to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they killed the drop them off at a </v>

3796
02:51:09.661 --> 02:51:10.494
<v Speaker 2>friend's house for god's sakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the kid was with </v>

3797
02:51:12.241 --> 02:51:13.074
<v Speaker 2>somebody or not is my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the story behind it is this </v>

3798
02:51:17.281 --> 02:51:20.400
<v Speaker 2>one brilliant guy figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extract nitrogen,</v>

3799
02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:24.210
<v Speaker 2>became this a fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A monster.</v>

3800
02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the reason why.</v>

3801
02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe somebody would've figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out eventually,</v>

3802
02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but he's the reason why they were able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that during world war.</v>

3803
02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.110
<v Speaker 2>I think someone eventually came along </v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure it out.</v>

3804
02:51:34.530 --> 02:51:35.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does she post that stuck with most </v>

3805
02:51:37.501 --> 02:51:38.334
<v Speaker 2>things with most things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the case with the </v>

3806
02:51:40.051 --> 02:51:41.910
<v Speaker 2>invention of the light bulb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a bunch of people that</v>

3807
02:51:41.911 --> 02:51:44.880
<v Speaker 2>are working on at the same time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>invention of a.</v>

3808
02:51:45.230 --> 02:51:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I think the telephone was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3809
02:51:46.681 --> 02:51:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Radio is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always like almost inventions.</v>

3810
02:51:51.031 --> 02:51:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about that chip </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of rewires your dna.</v>

3811
02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:55.343
<v Speaker 2>There's always these inventions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up the possibility of other </v>

3812
02:51:57.361 --> 02:51:58.194
<v Speaker 2>inventions and the technology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows for an invention like that gets </v>

3813
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:04.680
<v Speaker 2>analyzed by a bunch of different people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

3814
02:52:04.890 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always one of those things</v>

3815
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:10.600
<v Speaker 3>where anytime something happens today </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a network,</v>

3816
02:52:10.601 --> 02:52:11.434
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare that one person figures </v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing out that nobody ever saw </v>

3817
02:52:13.541 --> 02:52:14.374
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's a network of </v>

3818
02:52:15.701 --> 02:52:18.100
<v Speaker 3>inventions and innovations at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3819
02:52:18.130 --> 02:52:18.963
<v Speaker 3>Because you need machines and computers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these different things that </v>

3820
02:52:21.641 --> 02:52:22.474
<v Speaker 3>other people have created that allow you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the calculations to invent </v>

3821
02:52:24.461 --> 02:52:27.040
<v Speaker 3>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all it feeds off of all of it.</v>

3822
02:52:27.090 --> 02:52:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Then isn't it the best kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the best marketer,</v>

3823
02:52:30.341 --> 02:52:32.470
<v Speaker 3>best talker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get the notoriety for it.</v>

3824
02:52:32.471 --> 02:52:36.010
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes just like fighting right?</v>

3825
02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:39.453
<v Speaker 3>Full circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So before we end this canelo or gennady </v>

3826
02:52:44.060 --> 02:52:46.780
<v Speaker 3>golovkin oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a fucking fight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>downtown guadalajara,</v>

3829
02:52:52.180 --> 02:52:56.380
<v Speaker 3>they'll kick you the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for a canelo.</v>

3830
02:52:56.950 --> 02:53:00.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm rooting for a good performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>brennan shop because that's what I do.</v>

3831
02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:01.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3832
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:04.490
<v Speaker 3>I have to know about this case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3833
02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I want to see what happens.</v>

3834
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have like a guy I want to win.</v>

3835
02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Like if Virginia triple g wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be bummed out.</v>

3836
02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:13.900
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get fight.</v>

3837
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:16.170
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what happens when I'm that</v>

3838
02:53:16.171 --> 02:53:17.590
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see either guy lose.</v>

3839
02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Like I like both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to lose.</v>

3840
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anyone to have that l today</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3856
02:54:05.970 --> 02:54:07.240
<v Speaker 3>Thai boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3857
02:54:07.310 --> 02:54:10.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to throw up really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3858
02:54:11.460 --> 02:54:15.600
<v Speaker 3>the lady aT starbucks says shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking right.</v>

3859
02:54:15.601 --> 02:54:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't add extra shots to a caveman.</v>

3860
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Nitric lasers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tate tate.</v>

3861
02:54:19.591 --> 02:54:20.424
<v Speaker 3>Fletcher can consume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can throw that caveman nitrile down </v>

3862
02:54:23.161 --> 02:54:23.994
<v Speaker 3>like it's water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just wrap this up before you shut </v>

3863
02:54:24.781 --> 02:54:26.790
<v Speaker 3>yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit myself.</v>

02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:29.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you think's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not good at this.</v>

3865
02:54:29.740 --> 02:54:32.040
<v Speaker 3>My prediction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if triple g doesn't stop him,</v>

3866
02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:33.053
<v Speaker 3>canelo wins in a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The public's piss because you got To </v>

3867
02:54:35.011 --> 02:54:36.720
<v Speaker 3>look at the politics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Golden boy.</v>

3868
02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Canelo is the woodland.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3870
02:54:39.090 --> 02:54:41.400
<v Speaker 3>You're saying if triple g hold the music</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3871
02:54:41.610 --> 02:54:44.400
<v Speaker 3>He's saying if triple g outboxes and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't get the decision.</v>

3872
02:54:44.430 --> 02:54:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Box him for you.</v>

3873
02:54:48.110 --> 02:54:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I think you would because I think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>sets up the rematch.</v>

3874
02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd get a rematch no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>

3875
02:54:52.321 --> 02:54:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Even if it goes decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as no one gets stopped.</v>

3876
02:54:54.690 --> 02:54:55.523
<v Speaker 3>So you really think that if triple g he </v>
<v Speaker 3>puts on a show and outbox for like 10 </v>

3877
02:55:00.511 --> 02:55:01.740
<v Speaker 3>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think you will.</v>

3878
02:55:01.741 --> 02:55:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let's say it's like seven to six,</v>

3879
02:55:05.331 --> 02:55:06.890
<v Speaker 3>something like some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3880
02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:07.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My concern with caneLo is that he might </v>

3881
02:55:12.951 --> 02:55:13.784
<v Speaker 3>not have the endurance for a prolonged </v>
<v Speaker 3>firefight and you think triple g does </v>

3882
02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:22.680
<v Speaker 3>because he done against jacobs a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>tight against jacobs now.</v>

3883
02:55:22.750 --> 02:55:23.583
<v Speaker 3>That was a goddamn firefight as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And come on that fight because it was </v>

3884
02:55:28.980 --> 02:55:29.800
<v Speaker 3>close.</v>

3885
02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he won the fight.</v>

3886
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I'll give it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a very fucking clothes.</v>

3887
02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Jacob's completely different fighting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the canal.</v>

3888
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Jacob has watched that the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great fight.</v>

3889
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.963
<v Speaker 3>I forgot how good it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob's is a motherfucker clear some </v>

3890
02:55:39.711 --> 02:55:40.544
<v Speaker 3>space on my dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was deleting some boxing matches </v>

3891
02:55:42.690 --> 02:55:43.523
<v Speaker 3>like us goes to a certain thing like why</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I have 100 ted nugent spirit of the </v>

3892
02:55:47.391 --> 02:55:52.391
<v Speaker 3>wild safe to ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got to that fight and I said,</v>

3893
02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:57.560
<v Speaker 3>well let me wash this again because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>triple g fights coming up this weekend.</v>

3894
02:55:57.561 --> 02:56:01.220
<v Speaker 3>That was jacob's can fight his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a great fight.</v>

3895
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Toughest fight for triple g go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's over the hill,</v>

3896
02:56:03.930 --> 02:56:04.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jacob's just legit and completely </v>

3897
02:56:07.881 --> 02:56:08.930
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funneling canelo,</v>

3898
02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:11.580
<v Speaker 3>his footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes me wish terence crawford,</v>

3899
02:56:11.581 --> 02:56:12.414
<v Speaker 3>but just a little bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know because he's about 45 now who go </v>

3900
02:56:16.241 --> 02:56:17.120
<v Speaker 3>up to 47.</v>

3901
02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:18.100
<v Speaker 3>He was the flight pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>

3902
02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish she was like one 62 thin fella,</v>

3903
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:24.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just tell them all.</v>

3904
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:29.150
<v Speaker 3>I think pArt of his style is like he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>built perfect for the way he fights.</v>

3905
02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:31.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no perfect endurance.</v>

3906
02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:32.953
<v Speaker 3>If you put more weight on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd probably be weighed down a little </v>

3907
02:56:34.701 --> 02:56:38.560
<v Speaker 3>bit of slowing down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's definitely in a zone 40,</v>

3908
02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:40.190
<v Speaker 3>47.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way.</v>

3909
02:56:40.191 --> 02:56:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A killer year man,</v>

3910
02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:42.913
<v Speaker 3>because now they have anthony joshua,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting and then you have legit </v>

3911
02:56:46.100 --> 02:56:48.830
<v Speaker 3>goliath heavyweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Built like a statue.</v>

3912
02:56:48.890 --> 02:56:53.300
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a greek god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like really well spoken.</v>

3913
02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:56.120
<v Speaker 3>Super polite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Under around british guy.</v>

3914
02:56:56.280 --> 02:56:57.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you got a wild or deontay </v>

3915
02:56:59.301 --> 02:57:02.000
<v Speaker 3>wilder fighting a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the name?</v>

3916
02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking cuban killer.</v>

3917
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>King kong.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's fighting him.</v>

3919
02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a rough flight for.</v>

3920
02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a bad idea.</v>

3921
02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:17.150
<v Speaker 3>The winners of each of those will fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good time for boxing,</v>

3922
02:57:17.151 --> 02:57:19.370
<v Speaker 3>but tomorrow's the big one.</v>

3925
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:27.440
<v Speaker 3>one of the most skillful guys ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's not being challenged.</v>

3926
02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.240
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of drawl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3927
02:57:29.241 --> 02:57:32.480
<v Speaker 3>there's also not a guy in his division </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stands out as being the guy who has</v>

3928
02:57:32.481 --> 02:57:33.680
<v Speaker 3>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like mighty mouse.</v>

03:00:00.271 --> 03:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting the same guys.</v>

3985
03:00:02.911 --> 03:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3986
03:00:03.950 --> 03:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>he fought rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone went to a decision and a decision</v>

3987
03:00:08.381 --> 03:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>to rumble in world series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I light heavyweight.</v>

3988
03:00:10.250 --> 03:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rumbling world series.</v>

3989
03:00:11.791 --> 03:00:12.624
<v Speaker 1>He was a world beater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that long ago because it </v>

3990
03:00:15.391 --> 03:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the rumble in the ufc.</v>

3991
03:00:17.070 --> 03:00:17.903
<v Speaker 1>Also dave branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does running the ufc before world </v>

3992
03:00:19.471 --> 03:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not good thing.</v>

3993
03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a world series of fighting does </v>
<v Speaker 1>work well.</v>

3994
03:00:23.341 --> 03:00:24.174
<v Speaker 1>Gerald harris kao at him with a slam and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first fight was a great thing to </v>

3995
03:00:28.561 --> 03:00:29.394
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3996
03:00:29.710 --> 03:00:30.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he lost to somebody he'd say </v>

3997
03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>like it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how focused,</v>

3998
03:00:34.471 --> 03:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very skillful,</v>

3999
03:00:36.810 --> 03:00:37.643
<v Speaker 1>very skillful is ground gives very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about branch branch I think on </v>

4000
03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:41.281
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4001
03:00:41.281 --> 03:00:42.114
<v Speaker 1>It may see he can't say underrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's under because he was </v>

4002
03:00:46.051 --> 03:00:46.884
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing grab ass and world series of </v>

4003
03:00:47.671 --> 03:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even close to.</v>

4004
03:00:49.210 --> 03:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about wmb compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mba.</v>

4005
03:00:51.510 --> 03:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I Just think he's very talented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

4006
03:00:53.130 --> 03:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Rocco doesn't take them seriously the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

4007
03:00:55.051 --> 03:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take Bisping's seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He get fucked up 100 percent,</v>

4008
03:00:58.490 --> 03:00:59.323
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of pressure on rockhold </v>

4009
03:01:00.390 --> 03:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>because he's been gone for awhIle.</v>

4010
03:01:02.350 --> 03:01:03.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs that.</v>

4011
03:01:03.111 --> 03:01:03.944
<v Speaker 1>He needs this when my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way I think rockhold gets </v>

4012
03:01:06.461 --> 03:01:07.690
<v Speaker 1>fucked up is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4013
03:01:07.691 --> 03:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>if you don't take him serious and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if his heart's not in it,</v>

4014
03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>but if a game rockhold shows up a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

4015
03:01:15.171 --> 03:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>brand shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold destroys them.</v>

4016
03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:18.593
<v Speaker 1>You know what rocklIn could see </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording even submitting them </v>

4017
03:01:19.901 --> 03:01:20.734
<v Speaker 1>underrated with his top position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the top game is like having a </v>

4018
03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking tree on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

4019
03:01:25.330 --> 03:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

4020
03:01:26.801 --> 03:01:27.634
<v Speaker 1>You look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leo machida fight beat the shit out </v>

4021
03:01:29.961 --> 03:01:30.794
<v Speaker 1>of them from the top position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like when he fought weidman </v>

4022
03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:35.320
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he got weidman down,</v>

4023
03:01:35.321 --> 03:01:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you could see like why moves like </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked.</v>

4024
03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>He submitted bisbing with one arm after </v>
<v Speaker 1>a head kick,</v>

4025
03:01:40.031 --> 03:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>but still I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if rock called stand up is gonna</v>

4026
03:01:43.310 --> 03:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>be the difference maker and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long reach man.</v>

4027
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.863
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to make sure that he doesn't </v>

4028
03:01:48.701 --> 03:01:49.534
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and get clipped again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to see what happens because </v>

4029
03:01:51.191 --> 03:01:56.191
<v Speaker 1>when a guy like rockhold who has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose but not a lot to gain fights,</v>

4030
03:01:57.131 --> 03:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>a guy like branch who has the golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in front of them.</v>

4031
03:02:00.551 --> 03:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean if branch can beat rockhold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gigantic elevator.</v>

4032
03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean huge and I've been watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>training footage.</v>

4033
03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>he sees training fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the question is,</v>

4034
03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>is it hard enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has he been.</v>

4035
03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Is he in that kind of shape?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he at world class level?</v>

4036
03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:17.133
<v Speaker 1>He's really never fought anybody like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold other than rumble in the world </v>

4037
03:02:19.031 --> 03:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also with branch it's like,</v>

4038
03:02:21.401 --> 03:02:22.234
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the fucking governor off and go </v>

4039
03:02:24.521 --> 03:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>after it because it's his last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just a dance partner.</v>

4040
03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Even the world citi is findings out </v>
<v Speaker 1>murking guys.</v>

4041
03:02:30.251 --> 03:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's like in the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's never been that guy.</v>

4042
03:02:33.641 --> 03:02:34.474
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was afraid of luke rockhold </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the governor off and kick in the </v>

4043
03:02:36.821 --> 03:02:37.654
<v Speaker 1>fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting fight because </v>

4044
03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at it on paper,</v>

4045
03:02:41.111 --> 03:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it would be more of a showcase fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold.</v>

4046
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:44.343
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold was the former champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think David Branch is ranked in </v>

4047
03:02:47.321 --> 03:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the top five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's nine.</v>

4048
03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4049
03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big opportunity for branch.</v>

4050
03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old is branch?</v>

4051
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he's like 30 seconds till </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black death.</v>

4052
03:02:59.910 --> 03:03:02.280
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suffer good thing.</v>

4053
03:03:02.290 --> 03:03:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five.</v>

4054
03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not too old.</v>

4055
03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then brock hold is like what?</v>

4056
03:03:08.521 --> 03:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Thirty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocco was still pretty young.</v>

4057
03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:13.253
<v Speaker 1>I think that the thing about rockhold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs this fight because out of </v>

4058
03:03:15.961 --> 03:03:18.240
<v Speaker 1>sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of mind fund a grip.</v>

4059
03:03:18.241 --> 03:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>So everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4060
03:03:19.111 --> 03:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>let's see it now that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembers.</v>

4061
03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Bisping clipping them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking them out and then talking mad </v>

4062
03:03:24.181 --> 03:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>shit to him inside the cage after he </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

4063
03:03:27.450 --> 03:03:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Is this fight tonight or saturday night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomorrow night.</v>

4064
03:03:29.850 --> 03:03:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Is it for sure tomorrow night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want fight campaign?</v>

<v Speaker 1>But you're not going to be here.</v>

4066
03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You guys do a fight campaign instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wash.</v>

4067
03:03:37.110 --> 03:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4077
03:04:02.891 --> 03:04:05.180
<v Speaker 3>It would have been a lot better with </v>
<v Speaker 3>thiago alves and Mike Perry.</v>

4078
03:04:05.181 --> 03:04:09.620
<v Speaker 3>that would be a crazy fucking fight.</v>
