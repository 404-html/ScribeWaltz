00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches to hear about all those people dying from heroin overdoses</v>

2
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>because there was a bad batch of heroin in like Ohio or something.</v>

3
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>And like 41 people I've overdosed on like the same heroin or,</v>

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I did hear about that.</v>

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.003
<v Speaker 1>I did hear about it.</v>

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about that?</v>

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 2>how do you say that stuff?</v>

10
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Kratos him.</v>

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

12
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 2>Keratome k.</v>

13
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 2>R.</v>

14
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

15
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 2>T.</v>

16
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 2>O.</v>

17
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>M.</v>

18
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.183
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

19
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're probably close to a trout.</v>

20
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Them Kratom Kratom may be Kratom.</v>

21
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to say it.</v>

22
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:29.941
<v Speaker 2>I've never said it,</v>

23
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 2>but I've read about it a lot.</v>

24
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

25
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.371
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

26
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 2>a plant that helps people overcome opiate addiction apparently.</v>

28
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 2>And the FDA just moved it to schedule one or they're going to move it to</v>

29
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>schedule one or the DEA,</v>

30
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.221
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

31
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's the Dea.</v>

32
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.134
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

33
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

34
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.483
<v Speaker 2>it's a plant</v>

35
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>and apparently it helps a lot of people that have a heroin addiction problems</v>

36
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 2>and opiate addiction problems.</v>

37
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>And even some people said it helps with marijuana,</v>

38
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.591
<v Speaker 2>not marijuana,</v>

39
00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 2>but a alcohol withdrawals,</v>

40
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.421
<v Speaker 2>like people,</v>

41
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:01.021
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics.</v>

42
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 2>And they try to break free and get sober.</v>

43
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>This stuff can help with that too.</v>

44
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about it.</v>

45
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

46
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm to have,</v>

47
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have someone on to talk about it,</v>

48
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.674
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

49
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 2>there's no need to make anything else illegal like this,</v>

50
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 2>this thing where they're doing like what they're doing is they're behaving like</v>

51
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 2>an archaic society.</v>

52
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>They're not behaving like America 2016 they're behaving like the people who</v>

53
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.271
<v Speaker 2>enacted the very first sweeping psychedelic laws of 1970 they're behaving like</v>

54
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 2>they behaved.</v>

55
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 2>If you've got this plant,</v>

56
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>this Kratom or how have you say it and it doesn't have any history of people</v>

57
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 2>like dropping dead from it.</v>

58
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It's not like some threat to the communities.</v>

59
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this a terror that's sweeping the streets and it's ruining lives.</v>

60
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not hearing that.</v>

61
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>All I'm hearing is it helps people with heroin addiction.</v>

62
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 2>We all know how many people are addicted to heroin.</v>

63
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that they just want to step in and immediately not just make this</v>

64
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 2>like a schedule two or schedule three or have some scientists come in and</v>

65
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 2>testify about it and have some sort of public hearings where they discuss the</v>

66
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 2>merits of keeping this drug legal and should this be regulated?</v>

67
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Should it be prescribed by doctors like reasonable adults would do if they</v>

68
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 2>actually gave a fuck about each other,</v>

69
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>but instead they have these fucking ridiculous amounts of power where they could</v>

70
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 2>just step in and just make things illegal.</v>

71
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>They have a ridiculous amount of power when it comes to legislating what we can</v>

72
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>and can't do with our bodies because this is not something anybody's voting on</v>

73
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 2>this kratom stuff.</v>

74
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 2>So for the DEA to just step in and make that schedule one,</v>

75
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 2>it's blasphemy.</v>

76
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what they're doing is a mat.</v>

77
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

78
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 2>it's such an abuse of the function of the office.</v>

79
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 2>The idea of the office is you're supposed to be protecting people,</v>

80
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 2>protect people from math prep,</v>

81
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>protect people from bad shit.</v>

82
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.271
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

83
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Don't let people come home to find their children,</v>

84
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.421
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

86
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 2>that have overdosed because someone gave them bath salts,</v>

87
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

88
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.901
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

89
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody wants from something like the Dea.</v>

90
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>But they're so far reaching with their efforts that they step into all these</v>

91
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>areas where we know you're full of shit.</v>

92
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Now he's stepped in these areas like marijuana,</v>

93
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>or you're going to save people from pot.</v>

94
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

95
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You've fucking cock blocker.</v>

96
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.581
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

97
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna say people from giggling or eating yummy food or having a good time</v>

98
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:22.781
<v Speaker 2>with their friends.</v>

99
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>What are you going?</v>

100
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.411
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>

101
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.244
<v Speaker 2>what are you stopping?</v>

102
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.881
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

103
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>this is not anything that we should ever,</v>

104
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

105
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>not anything we should ever ask for from our leaders in quotes,</v>

106
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 2>and definitely not anything we should ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever.</v>

107
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason whatsoever why they would keep marijuana illegal.</v>

108
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason whatsoever whether it would make this kratom stuff scheduled</v>

109
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:42.461
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

110
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking reasons.</v>

111
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>

112
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

113
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.981
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

114
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a sure sign that it's a corrupt system.</v>

115
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>If that Kratom stuff helps with alcohol withdrawals,</v>

116
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:56.071
<v Speaker 2>then you got to know that these big companies would,</v>

117
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't they pitch them some money to be like,</v>

118
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

119
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 2>let's you don't want Mencken.</v>

120
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Even if they didn't do it blatantly,</v>

121
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 2>even if they didn't do it blatantly,</v>

122
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>if they're in tangled with each other,</v>

123
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you can best believe that if you are entangled with some sort of an alcohol</v>

124
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:12.724
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

125
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do your best to maximize the profits of that alcohol company.</v>

126
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

127
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just the way it is.</v>

128
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're entangled with some donor to some political campaign or some,</v>

129
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

130
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 2>you know like foundation that you run and they give millions of dollars,</v>

131
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>like you guys having a little agreement going on there.</v>

132
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to even say it.</v>

133
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have a written down.</v>

134
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to be stupid about it,</v>

135
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty obvious.</v>

136
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>If someone gives you millions of bucks there,</v>

137
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you know you guys are out,</v>

138
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 2>you guys are doing business,</v>

139
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>something's happening here.</v>

140
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to do nice things for each other now.</v>

141
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

142
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 2>that's where a lot of this shit comes from.</v>

143
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

144
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we,</v>

145
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

146
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.270
<v Speaker 2>the people that are supposed to be represented by these clowns can sit back and</v>

147
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 2>just be frustrated and not do anything.</v>

148
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>We could vote for it when it comes up in our states.</v>

149
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 2>But federally it's a giant issue federally.</v>

150
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Federally is the real problem because there's a bunch of states now that made it</v>

151
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:09.641
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>

152
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.560
<v Speaker 2>including Washington fucking DC.</v>

153
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of states that have made pot legal there.</v>

154
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.561
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

155
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:14.741
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

156
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.510
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>

157
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't the scientists and fit?</v>

158
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And then they start taxing it and then they make unbelievable amounts of money</v>

159
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 2>and then they have massive resurgences and their economy like you're seeing in</v>

160
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>Colorado and now you're seeing in Seattle and Washington state as well.</v>

161
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is they're,</v>

162
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 2>they're being Tyron nickel like these,</v>

163
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

164
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 2>this is not like reasonable people acting in a reasonable way out that they're</v>

165
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>locking people up for a long time.</v>

166
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

167
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>There was this fucking thing the other day where they were comparing that kid</v>

168
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.210
<v Speaker 2>who raped the girl and what university was that.</v>

169
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>It has got ridiculously short amount of time.</v>

170
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.071
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

171
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a mic on Stanford.</v>

172
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.033
<v Speaker 2>Stanford?</v>

173
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.963
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

174
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

175
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 2>so they compared that guy too.</v>

176
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm sit some poor bastard that,</v>

177
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

178
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I think he got 30 years for growing pot.</v>

179
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

180
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that picture?</v>

181
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.863
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it?</v>

182
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.981
<v Speaker 2>Dude?</v>

183
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>He was even longer than 30 years,</v>

184
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.231
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

185
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:12.801
<v Speaker 2>It might've been.</v>

186
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 2>It might've been like 30 to life or something,</v>

187
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the idea that you would lock that guy away for that long for</v>

188
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>something so fucking innocuous.</v>

189
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.990
<v Speaker 2>We'll put it below little blank.</v>

190
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.331
<v Speaker 2>The law.</v>

191
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's real simple.</v>

192
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>We got a law or you don't want to break it.</v>

193
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

194
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>You take your consequences.</v>

195
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 2>We're adults here.</v>

196
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.311
<v Speaker 2>We're all adults.</v>

197
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 2>These laws are stupid.</v>

198
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 2>We're being handicapped by these ancient systems,</v>

199
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>these ancient systems of control.</v>

200
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.671
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

201
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 2>they're not valid anymore.</v>

202
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 2>He can't just lock people up for pot.</v>

203
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's stupid.</v>

204
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.243
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

205

<v Speaker 2>parole for being caught growing three dozen marijuana plants behind my son's</v>

208
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

229
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.750

230
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to rape a girl,</v>

231
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>don't do it on a pile of marijuana plants.</v>

232
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.483
<v Speaker 2>That's what we learned.</v>

233
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a good plus three months.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
