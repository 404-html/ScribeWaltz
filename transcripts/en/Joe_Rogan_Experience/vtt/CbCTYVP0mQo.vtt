1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
Appearing at the Atlanta Improv October 16th 17th and eight that's how my

2
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:09.190
daughter does punchlines.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.900
My former,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.820
my four year old rather,

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.753
I former,

6
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.320
my four year old daughter,

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.980
she goes,

8
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.410
what kind of tree grows in your hand?

9
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
Are Palm trees and then she'll hit the same punchline over and over again and

10
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:22.750
over.

11
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.060
Yeah,

12
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.671
it's hilarious.

13
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.241
Do it really.

14
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.950
I want do it with formality.

15
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.700
I want enthusiasms appearing at the Ed.

16
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.690
Less improper.

17
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.400
It's the one and only Brian motherfucking Callan.

18
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.330
October 16th 17th and 18th got Tim and I have to sneeze.

19
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.661
No Way.

20
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:40.170
The kid,

21
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.590
the kid,

22
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.650
what did in the middle of might,

23
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.350
I'm going to Ah dammit.

24
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.930
In the middle.

25
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.260
Brian Killen by the kid.

26
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.550
I'll be the crash signed the kid.

27
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.480
No way in person.

28
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.760
I hear his weapon or looking at super athletic.

29
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.780
He's beautiful here.

30
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:53.230
The way he moves moves on the inside,

31
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.511
I don't mean is,

32
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.320
but I mean soul adorable.

33
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.050
October 16th 17th 18th the Atlanta Improv,

34
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.610
if it's like any of the other Improv's.

35
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:03.151
It's awesome.

36
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.240
The improv is the premiere comedy club chain in the country.

37
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.640
And if you nowhere near Atlanta,

38
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.310
if you happen to be in Philadelphia or Washington DC,

39
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.950
I'm at the tower theater on Friday,

40
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.180
October 7th in Philadelphia and then um,

41
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.980
at the Warner theater on Friday,

42
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.350
Saturday rather October 18th.

43
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.610
Both of those gigs,

44
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.740
the October 18th one to Washington DC,

45
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.250
the Warner theater in Washington DC.

46
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.230
Both those gigs are with Ian Edwards.

47
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.480
So the 17 Marion Philadelphia,

48
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.601
oh,

49
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.434
he's awesome.

50
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.060
Fucking awesome.

51
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.110
High level headliner.

52
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.571
So Philadelphia,

53
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.150
October 17th and then Washington DC,

54
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.140
October 18th.

55
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.100
That's for me and Brian Callan is October 16th,

56
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.960
17th and 18th.

57
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.610
And Brian Cowan is back and mother fucking seven

58
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.640
five days in the rain,

59
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.840
sleeping on a slant,

60
00:01:57.841 --> 00:01:59.340
poo it outside.

61
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.181
I'm not sick,

62
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.800
but I do have something going on in my nose.

63
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.451
It's the,

64
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.540
it's an La air.

65
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.540
After all that pristine that dropped off 1300 feet above sea level in a sea

66
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:10.950
plane,

67
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.610
it took three plants in a sea plane,

68
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.450
get dropped off on a lake,

69
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.370
a mountain lake that you could drink out of,

70
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.121
which we did drink.

71
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.260
We drank out of the link.

72
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.130
That's how clean it is.

73
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.341
Yeah,

74
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:20.760
it's a May.

75
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.600
It's rainwater.

76
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:21.720
Yeah.

77
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.560
It's made of rain.

78
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.270
There's not even any fish in that lake,

79
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.500
which is really crazy.

80
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:26.041
It's weird,

81
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:26.340
right?

82
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.990
It's a huge lake and it's,

83
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.050
there's no rivers that go into it and there's also several leaks on Prince of

84
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:34.291
Wales island.

85
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:34.471
I mean,

86
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.690
maybe there's a couple of fish in there I don't know about,

87
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.050
but we didn't see any clear crystal clear water and there's several layers,

88
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.530
like some of them were up high and other ones are like,

89
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:46.950
you know,

90
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.720
a few hundred feet below it.

91
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.620
There's another lake.

92
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.640
It's really weird.

93
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.290
Also when you were hiking through that terrain,

94
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.980
you'll cut through the woods and like just cut it through this rain forest and

95
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.560
then you just come across this clearing with another little pond or lake.

96
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.371
It's like shooting a lot,

97
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:00.700
man.

98
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.391
Everywhere.

99
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.130
This legs,

100
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.400
it gets more rain,

101
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.890
more rainfall than any other place in America.

102
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.660
It's 160 inches of rainfall.

103
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.970
Apparently Rinella said it's one of the biggest islands in America next to the

104
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:13.804
Hawaiian islands.

105
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.260
It's bigger than the big Hawaii Island at Prince of Wales.

106
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:17.760
Islands I believe is actually,

107
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.380
that's what our friend Matt said.

108
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.930
Crazy.

109
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.830
That's what Matt said,

110
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.540
but I believe Rinella said it was half the size of the hole.

111
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.540
Okay,

112
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.180
let's find out.

113
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.350
Let's find out how big it is.

114
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.603
Prince of Wales.

115
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.820
We spend our entire time and basically wet.

116
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.640
Even though you're wearing what?

117
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.480
Rain care and nothing dries out.

118
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.343
Nothing.

119
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.940
First Day of my shirt got wet.

120
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.774
It never dried out.

121
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.430
You know,

122
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.280
it's the fourth largest island after Hawaii,

123
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.293
Kodiak,

124
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.790
and it's one 10th the size of Ireland.

125
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.481
Whoa.

126
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.520
Slightly larger than the state of Delaware.

127
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.013
It's crazy.

128
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.150
And oh by the Oh and and and very important.

129
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.030
Didn't see any,

130
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.440
didn't see any beer.

131
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.080
You'd be,

132
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.070
he'd be funny.

133
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.250
It's a huge island man.

134
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.660
Three planes to get there.

135
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.550
I'm looking through my binoculars.

136
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.503
How many deer?

137
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.483
I saw one.

138
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.341
Yeah,

139
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.080
there was two dose,

140
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.914
which I couldn't shoot.

141
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.221
We,

142
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:08.830
it was not one we can according to Rinella.

143
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.080
We went there at a bad time,

144
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.730
which is fucking weird.

145
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.300
Since he was the guy hosting the Goddamn show with right.

146
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.260
That means the deer,

147
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.310
even the deer were like,

148
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.210
this sucks.

149
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.260
Let's go to the deer were like,

150
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.510
it's

151
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.301
<v 1>too rainy and windy.</v>

152
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:22.661
Here let's,

153
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:23.590
let's move down.

154
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.371
Even the deer,

155
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:24.790
we're like,

156
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.623
see Yah.

157
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.901
Yeah.

158
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:27.210
The deer went towards the ocean.

159
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.900
Can humans with their fire sticks?

160
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.471
We,

161
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.100
uh,

162
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.410
we saw very few animals,

163
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:37.411
but it was still unbelievably beautiful and it was so clean.

164
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.290
That's the weirdest thing about the air there was so clean that when we got to

165
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:41.711
la,

166
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:42.544
we both were like,

167
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.473
Ooh,

168
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.940
we smelled the air and was like panic.

169
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:47.410
My nose closed up immediately.

170
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.050
The real remember at the airport,

171
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.730
I mean granted we were in traffic,

172
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:51.931
but I,

173
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.420
I was shocked.

174
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.101
My system went,

175
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:55.600
what started closing down?

176
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.930
Well,

177
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.300
we were breathing in this moist,

178
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.710
clear air,

179
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.970
drinking clean water,

180
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.480
but I'll take this over that every fucking day of the week.

181
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.201
First of all,

182
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.310
just want to get that out of the way.

183
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.720
Like especially because we didn't have a house,

184
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.780
we were camping and if you've ever camped in the rain,

185
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.670
you might be able to pull it off for a day.

186
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.380
Might be able to pull it off for two days,

187
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.450
but once you start getting into that fifth day,

188
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.030
oh God is it suck a fat one.

189
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.080
You know what was happening to me,

190
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:23.860
I became,

191
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.840
I was becoming like a fetish fetishistic whatever the word is about my gear,

192
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.860
like how,

193
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860
how to keep everything dry and I was even like making my sandwiches secretly in

194
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.660
the tent.

195
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.380
I would steal away meant when you said you were like,

196
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:39.161
were you making sandwiches?

197
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:39.491
I was like,

198
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.324
Huh,

199
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.080
Huh.

200
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.610
You took mayonnaise and bread and meat and went into your tent and I hit and I

201
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:45.851
was like,

202
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:46.571
fuck those guys.

203
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:47.500
I'm eating a sandwich.

204
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.280
I'll eat the dry asphalt.

205
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.920
I was turning on the whole camp.

206
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.191
Well,

207
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.490
I got a little bit better at figuring out how to deal with the rain,

208
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.570
but at one point,

209
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.010
you know where these headlamps,

210
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.561
so they're like,

211
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.250
they're like,

212
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.050
like a mining hat sort of thing.

213
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.590
On the top of your forehead you have this light and it's a catch for a strap and

214
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.401
I turned it on.

215
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.401
I turned my strap on inside the tent and it was like a sea of do like the inside

216
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.573
of the tent,

217
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.870
like everywhere you look,

218
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.130
it was like it was raining.

219
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.860
These microscopic drops of water.

220
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.500
It was like looking out into a downpour,

221
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.030
a microscopic drop downpour.

222
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.150
So there's these tiny little drips everywhere,

223
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.450
but the inside of the tent was filled with moisture.

224
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.290
Everything.

225
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.101
Your sleeping bag was wet.

226
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:33.750
I sleeping bag but had a sheen I do under grace.

227
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.820
It's really fun to sleep in that.

228
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.061
Oh,

229
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.810
it's a good time.

230
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.680
You could take your hand and you rub it over the top of my sleeping bag in your

231
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:43.430
hand would be wet and the inside was wet like my hands got wet.

232
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.520
Wool is fucking amazing.

233
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.790
Yup.

234
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.181
Okay.

235
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:50.120
If you're wearing cotton out there in this kind of weather,

236
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:51.080
you're really fucked.

237
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.010
But wool is an incredible material when you're wearing wool.

238
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.680
Wool somehow know that even if the clothes are wet,

239
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.790
you retain heat.

240
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.320
Yeah.

241
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.250
It's really the oils and the wall,

242
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:01.581
I guess.

243
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:04.520
And also we'll wicks away moisture from the body for whatever reason,

244
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.500
but does it because I get it must,

245
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.011
I don't know.

246
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.070
It must wick away but not tries quickly.

247
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.910
You ever notice that?

248
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.190
Like apparently it dries quickly,

249
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.600
but they say cotton kills.

250
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.490
If you're in wet cold environments and you're hiking whatever and you were

251
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.324
caught and you will,

252
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.290
that's how people die.

253
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.561
Yeah,

254
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.490
because you sweat.

255
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.730
Yeah.

256
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.000
And then you get wet and then you get freezing cold.

257
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:28.040
Like we were in a constant state of when you're hiking,

258
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.821
first of all,

259
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.500
we're s we're following you weren't,

260
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.540
but I was following Steve,

261
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:33.590
the Billy goat Rinella.

262
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.340
Okay.

263
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.280
This fucker does this shit 365 days a year.

264
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:39.350
I'm lucky that I'm in good shape.

265
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:39.640
And uh,

266
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.410
lucky also that I work my legs out like crazy.

267
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:42.770
Yeah.

268
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.710
Those poor guys like,

269
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.080
oh grocery skipped leg day.

270
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.133
You ever see those guys?

271
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.080
They look like a meatball with to,

272
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.430
they'd be two sticks.

273
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.264
They'd be fucked.

274
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.350
Terrible hunting bodies.

275
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.960
Yeah.

276
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.940
I worked my legs out more than any other part of my body because the kickboxing

277
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.190
and I just am always doing squats.

278
00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:58.590
And noisy,

279
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.000
so my legs really didn't get tired even though it was five days of pretty

280
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:02.834
intense hiking.

281
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.960
But my cardio got tested seriously and I was sweating like a fucking pig.

282
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.710
So you'd get to the top of this.

283
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.401
First of all,

284
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:13.400
I didn't layer it right like when we talked to my team,

285
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.790
uh,

286
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.320
one of our friends that we met down there,

287
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.410
shout out to [inaudible],

288
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.900
shout out 10 prints,

289
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.003

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.420
other,

291
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.070
another shout out to shout out Guy Friend Dui are a are our English friend,

292
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:25.610
Dean.

293
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.443
Great fucking guy.

294
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.380
All the people there.

295
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:27.711
Mike,

296
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:28.910
Shout out to Mike from Austin.

297
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.120
Cool fucking crew just to give a shout out to fucking awesome Dan Dodi.

298
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.110
Everybody is beautiful.

299
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:36.800
It's a great cat.

300
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.970
Like we had a fucking legitimately awesome time and it's one of the most

301
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:42.260
miserable conditions,

302
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.961
the world.

303
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:43.670
We laughed,

304
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.391
we laughed the whole time.

305
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.190
Other than like freezing cold,

306
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.090
the it's the most miserable because you're just drenched all the time.

307
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.960
Yeah,

308
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.220
I guess actually I would take that honestly over like desert conditions,

309
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.900
like 130 degrees because there's no water.

310
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.520
But my hands were pruning.

311
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.730
My hands were so wet for so long for get gloves.

312
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:03.970
By the way your hands are just going to do,

313
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.260
don't.

314
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.750
Yeah it does look like they've been in the pool for two days.

315
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.650
But those again,

316
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:08.550
those first light,

317
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.690
those wool gloves,

318
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.370
the fucking wall.

319
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.780
Even though your hands are wet,

320
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.980
it keeps your hands warm.

321
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.970
It's really weird.

322
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.840
I don't know how it works.

323
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.460
Well for first light is a company that sponsors a I l.

324
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.580
I t e first light,

325
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.740
they sponsor midi to podcast.

326
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:26.130
We've got a bunch of their gear and our friend Brian Callahan works for them and

327
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:27.750
everything they make is Merino wool.

328
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:28.670
And I was like why my mom?

329
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.460
This is Whoa,

330
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.460
what the fuck is will will is the shit the shit in cold weather you got to get

331
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:35.760
wool and layer,

332
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.380
layer down cause you keep warm.

333
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.760
Actually people were really tight.

334
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:39.780
Stuff is the wrong thing to do.

335
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:41.490
You want to keep an air pocket around your body.

336
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.720
That's how animals keep warm.

337
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.770
So Martin was telling me you should really wear very little when you go out and

338
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:48.240
then keep everything else in your pack.

339
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.830
That would have been the smart thing to do.

340
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:50.820
I didn't do it that way.

341
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.460
I put all the layers on so by the time I got to the top of the mountain,

342
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.271
I'm fucking,

343
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:55.830
I'm literally drenched.

344
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.300
My legs are drenched,

345
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.440
my upper body's drench.

346
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.990
And then you have to sit down and eat glass.

347
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.910
So Glassy means you use your binoculars.

348
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.110
We sit down and looking for dear.

349
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.790
Oh dear.

350
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.760
Oh No.

351
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.430
Okay.

352
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.410
So we're sitting there looking for deer,

353
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.380
freezing my dick completely off.

354
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.580
And you do well on the call.

355
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.670
But I as the first time I've ever seen you shiver like you are shaking.

356
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.900
You are so called one time when we,

357
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.180
I think it was the morning you came in and you were like,

358
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:21.750
because you had been,

359
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.110
you'd been spent all night wet and you came in and I was like,

360
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.561
I was like,

361
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:26.880
I knew you were too much to say anything,

362
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:27.900
but I was literally like,

363
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.500
get him,

364
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.560
get him a thermos full of hot water to put it in his jacket.

365
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.060
Cause he's,

366
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.950
I actually got a little protective over.

367
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:34.920
Aw Sweetie.

368
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.760
Well you were like,

369
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.690
you were shaking man.

370
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.970
Yeah,

371
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.621
that's definitely share.

372
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:38.454
It was no joke.

373
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.331
It was cold.

374
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.070
I mean in the morning it was probably in the forties.

375
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:41.400
It was,

376
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.950
it was not the most fun being wet and cold.

377
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.851
But I'm telling you,

378
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:47.940
it's better than being hot is as weird as it sounds.

379
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:49.110
It's sucks a fat dick.

380
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.780
But you could warm up just by running up hills.

381
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.040
Like if I wanted to,

382
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:53.910
like while I was freezing,

383
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.660
I could've just went,

384
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:54.871
fuck,

385
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:55.051
fuck,

386
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.231
fuck,

387
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:55.411
fuck,

388
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:56.040
fuck,

389
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.731
fuck.

390
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.700
And just went running up a hill and I would have been warmed by the time I got

391
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.570
to the top of the hill.

392
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:00.880
Yeah,

393
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.950
I would have been sweating again,

394
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.180
but the art that,

395
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.730
that there is an art to learning how to,

396
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.690
like Martine said,

397
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.360
you climbed them out and he'll client at the top of the mount of t shirt and one

398
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:10.650
layer sweats,

399
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:12.650
takes that tee shirt right off and puts two layers on that.

400
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.670
Or a guy that's more,

401
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.500
puts that tee shirt back on when it's come time to come down and look,

402
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.350
we did this shit for on purpose.

403
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.400
We did it for fun,

404
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.210
for the adventure because we love Rinella and we love the show and all the guys

405
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:24.601
in the show,

406
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.160
but those fucking camera,

407
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.290
those guys who work on that show,

408
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.830
Mike and dean and and and well Dodi's a producer,

409
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:33.300
but then Dodi's also cameramen,

410
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.680
those guys that work on that show Dodi's a director to now and a producer.

411
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:37.920
Yeah,

412
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.140
but those guys that work on that fucking show,

413
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:40.981
God damn,

414
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:41.970
they have a hard job.

415
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.151
Yeah,

416
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:44.910
they do those guys and they're just getting paid.

417
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.730
They're getting paid.

418
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.070
That's what they do every week.

419
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:48.570
Every week they're camping somewhere.

420
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.470
Freezing.

421
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.100
Yeah.

422
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.610
Hungry.

423
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.510
You know where they're going next.

424
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.740
They go to the jungle,

425
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.660
they're going down to fuck Olivia or something.

426
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.900
Some crazy shit.

427
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.480
We're bugs boob where you get where I said Dan has other things to worry about

428
00:11:59.481 --> 00:11:59.541
it.

429
00:11:59.541 --> 00:11:59.770
He goes,

430
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.910
he's been in the Amazon number times.

431
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:01.240
He goes,

432
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:01.900
oh yeah.

433
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.561
I said like what?

434
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:02.920
He goes,

435
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.550
snakes,

436
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.180
spiders,

437
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.820
Scorpions and bugs you'd never seen before.

438
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.080
Bucks can change your life.

439
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:09.040
Don't know about,

440
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.113
by the way,

441
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.021
by the way,

442
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.030
whenever Brian counts here,

443
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.520
by the way,

444
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.480
see the self to death.

445
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:13.710
I,

446
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.590
it's contagious.

447
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:15.880
It's like Hashtag by the way,

448
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:17.410
it's like when Brody Stevens is here,

449
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.580
you go enjoy it.

450
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.533
Hadn't Joanie?

451
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.393
Yes.

452
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.910
You can't help yourself.

453
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.490
But they had that banana spider down there,

454
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:24.671
right?

455
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:25.930
Or is that an in the Philippines?

456
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.471
I don't know.

457
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.690
I mean they have a lot of fucked up spiders in the Amazon.

458
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.020
They have thousands of things that people have never even discovered.

459
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.330
They're always finding new species of bugs down there.

460
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.370
Things that defy explanation.

461
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.930
They bugs.

462
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:38.340
Man,

463
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.590
I'm,

464
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.220
I'm not a fan.

465
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.180
I'm okay with other stuff.

466
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:40.481
I'm not,

467
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:41.440
I'm not okay with bugs.

468
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.370
Like I like,

469
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.560
I'll deal with like grizzlies,

470
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:45.011
like okay,

471
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:45.870
there's a grizzly amount.

472
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.601
You'd be scared,

473
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.920
but bugs are the intangible,

474
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:52.810
like some huge stinging wasp that can fuck that.

475
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:54.700
Or a spider that puts you in a necrosis.

476
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.480
I can,

477
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.290
you know like the Brown,

478
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.490
the Brown recluse,

479
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.480
your,

480
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:58.811
your,

481
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.940
your skin starts to decay.

482
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.410
Jeremy Horn had one of those and it left like a golf ball sized hole in his leg.

483
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.910
He left the fucking hole,

484
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.110
just ate through his leg.

485
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.801
Fair de Lance.

486
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:09.010
What?

487
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.060
When it was snakes bite you?

488
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:10.894
That happens.

489
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.780
You have to to got bit in the foot by federal lands,

490
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:14.883
which means,

491
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.160
which by the way I believe means sort of fire fell.

492
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:20.410
Denounce his French feminists

493
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.460
that don't just sound spell Donelle so cell phone theft,

494
00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:26.200
no nose.

495
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.621
By the way,

496
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:29.350
Bryan County did several characters over the time.

497
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.830
One of the reasons why I love going on these trips at Brian is because it

498
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:36.670
becomes a giant five day comedy and becomes a Brian Count shelter.

499
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:36.971
It's my,

500
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:37.900
it's a captive audience.

501
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:38.710
You're not going anywhere.

502
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.760
You're going to go,

503
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.490
but it's also your style of humor.

504
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.990
It's like that's what you do.

505
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.810
Like when there's a group of guys around all of a sudden,

506
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.380
I mean you would think that you would get tired of gay jokes after five days.

507
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:50.800
No,

508
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.020
because he's got a bunch of different gay characters.

509
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.453
The Russian,

510
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.550
the Russian who makes you eat salad for many days for reflux.

511
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.590
You in the ass cause he wants your asshole clean,

512
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.773
clean asshole.

513
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.010
You have to have to,

514
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:03.130
we have to keep it clean.

515
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.580
You know,

516
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.700
has clean eat it,

517
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.531
just sell it.

518
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:06.830
I smack you this,

519
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.040
this video of him explaining to Steve Rinella what he wants Reno's diet to be

520
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:12.874
like.

521
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.911
Dodi's thinking of a,

522
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:15.490
putting it online like somehow or another,

523
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:16.900
figuring out do it online,

524
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.270
do it an unnamed way.

525
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.660
It's mostly because I have you as an audience and there's your one of the best

526
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.870
laughers I just realized that after knowing me for 20 years,

527
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:26.470
I was like,

528
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.101
you know what?

529
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.680
I think he might be one of the greatest laughers cause you,

530
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.930
you cackle you literally,

531
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:33.340
when you're laughing you literally go,

532
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:37.320
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

533
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:38.240
I,

534
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.190
it's seductive to me.

535
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.060
I'm literally,

536
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.150
and then those guys or those guys are such good audiences to,

537
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.690
well it's just,

538
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:44.860
you know,

539
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.730
we were talking about how some comedians are just not good at being like an

540
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:49.690
audience member.

541
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.230
And one of the things that when Brian and I first met Brian was on this show

542
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:59.231
called mad TV and I was a guest on the show and Brian and I were hanging out in

543
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:00.861
the cafeteria,

544
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.680
we eat dinner and while we were eating dinner,

545
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.390
Brian was making me laugh.

546
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.290
It was cracking me up,

547
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:10.040
but we were with a few other actors and instead of laughing at Brian,

548
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.560
they were trying to one up him and I was like,

549
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.750
oh this is so gross.

550
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:17.510
Like you can't even just let a guy be funny.

551
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.600
Like it's one thing if like comedy in those certain circumstances it's like

552
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:23.791
it's,

553
00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:25.760
it's totally intuitive thing.

554
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.450
It's like you have to know if you actually have something funny to say or not.

555
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.900
Again,

556
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.170
if,

557
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.880
if there's something funny that you can do,

558
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.180
you've got to feel it and you just got to run with it and no one can understand

559
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:35.271
it.

560
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:35.540
No one,

561
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.600
no one can explain when something's going to be funny and when something's not

562
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.091
going to be fun.

563
00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:39.771
It's completely,

564
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:40.670
totally instinctive.

565
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:46.030
But what these guys were doing was like being like ultra super calculated and

566
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:47.301
competitive.

567
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.250
They weren't really listening right now are being affected.

568
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.510
I was thinking about,

569
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.110
you know,

570
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.480
it's,

571
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.480
it's very underrated quality when you have a friend who can really laugh at at

572
00:15:56.571 --> 00:15:57.080
things.

573
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.913
Oh yeah.

574
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.870
It was really fun thing to have around.

575
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.351
Yeah.

576
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:01.580
Bravo is great for that.

577
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.720
That's a really,

578
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.050
you know,

579
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.681
that's a really,

580
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:06.710
really pleasant thing to be.

581
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.100
My,

582
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.600
my sister was my first audience.

583
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:11.480
My sister couldn't laugh her ass off at things that she was.

584
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.440
I remember as a kid her laughing really hard at me cackling and I was like,

585
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.651
oh,

586
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:16.440
I think I might be fun.

587
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.273
That was the first,

588
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.830
that was the first thing where I was like,

589
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:19.880
my sister actually lasts.

590
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:20.061
I mean,

591
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:20.900
maybe I can do this.

592
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:21.111
You know?

593
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:21.681
It's funny,

594
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:22.190
man.

595
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:22.791
That's funny.

596
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:27.320
So from Montana to Wisconsin to now,

597
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.030
well we failed in this attempt.

598
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:29.720
This is the only time,

599
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.670
well I shouldn't say that cause the TV show's gonna air.

600
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.151
Whoops.

601
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:33.020
Cat's out of the bag.

602
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.131
Great show.

603
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:34.640
Either way,

604
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.473
it's going to be a lot of fun.

605
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.040
But we had a great time in every circumstance.

606
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.260
Like even though we're in like one of the worst,

607
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.520
most uncomfortable positions you could find yourself in like co constantly

608
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:47.330
drenched.

609
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.590
No hope in sight.

610
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.800
You're only hope for like shelter is this cloth house that you're sleeping in.

611
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.840
That's the size of a small car.

612
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.490
You know you're climbing into a VW bug that's a cloth house and inside at your

613
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:04.490
wet and that's your shelter and it's not an even surface.

614
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.770
Good luck finding an even surface in Alaska.

615
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.880
Everything hurt too,

616
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:08.121
man.

617
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.110
Like when I would get up,

618
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.130
my back would hurt,

619
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:10.821
my neck would hurt,

620
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.070
my shoulders would hurt cause I have to sleep on my side,

621
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:13.580
you know,

622
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.030
so I'm,

623
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.241
you know,

624
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:17.210
the first two days I was so tired from hiking my,

625
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.970
my legs and my hips because I hadn't had any,

626
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.640
I'm not as stout as you are simply not a stout.

627
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.140
What's I prepared for this?

628
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.250
Remember when I was going to bed?

629
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:28.521
You're like,

630
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:29.061
you're going to bed.

631
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:29.331
I was like,

632
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:29.511
no,

633
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:30.210
I'm just going to go to my,

634
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.780
I have to just work on,

635
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:32.301
I'm going to go,

636
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.021
just read.

637
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:34.160
I have to take care of something.

638
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:35.280
I was literally out,

639
00:17:35.281 --> 00:17:36.114
dude.

640
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:36.800
Yeah,

641
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.633
you were snoring.

642
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.600
Um,

643
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.980
I really prepared for this.

644
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.461
Like I'm,

645
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:41.450
I always work out,

646
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.410
but I did a lot of,

647
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:42.920
um,

648
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.870
a stair climber for this Dick.

649
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:45.141
Man.

650
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:46.040
I didn't do shit.

651
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.671
And of course you did.

652
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:47.181
It's smart.

653
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:49.040
And I did a lot of lip tickle on like very,

654
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.770
uh,

655
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.960
like I put the elliptical on like number 21,

656
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.033
and just talking to her

657
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.380
and I'll do sprints.

658
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.020
Yeah.

659
00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:56.190
Well,

660
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.023
I knew,

661
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.210
I knew I should've just run hills with a pack on my back.

662
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.640
Well also I did a lot of body weight squats,

663
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.950
body weight squats and pistol squats,

664
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:05.611
pistol squats,

665
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:07.890
important because there's a lot of times you're picking yourself up with one

666
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:08.640
leg,

667
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.210
you know,

668
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.701
like your,

669
00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:09.960
uh,

670
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.201
your,

671
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:10.560
your,

672
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.870
we were first of all ruined.

673
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.990
I don't know how you guys did it,

674
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:16.810
but Rinella will climb up some treacherous fucking surfaces there.

675
00:18:16.811 --> 00:18:16.950
Well,

676
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.880
they told me that [inaudible] told me that we were moving at a strata of Sim of

677
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.820
simple pace,

678
00:18:22.821 --> 00:18:23.990
like not a high paced.

679
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.080
He goes and he said,

680
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.620
you have no idea how fast he goes,

681
00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:27.350
if you ever been with right now.

682
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.661
I said,

683
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:27.781
no.

684
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:28.470
I said,

685
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.420
you have no idea how fast he moves.

686
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.060
And,

687
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.220
and that's when I said I,

688
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:32.460
he said,

689
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.430
we were literally at a moving at our own time.

690
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:35.821
We'll,

691
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:36.960
Remi really Warren,

692
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:38.400
I don't know if they've ever tested Rinella,

693
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:38.971
is cardio,

694
00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:41.400
but Remy who's also a big time hunter,

695
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:42.660
he hunts 300 days a year.

696
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:46.200
He's got that show solo hunter and he's got to a few shows that he's working on

697
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.410
right now with Dan Dodi,

698
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.840
the fascinating guy.

699
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:49.350
Um,

700
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.190
but he's,

701
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.170
his cardio is so good.

702
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.410
It's that like elite endurance athlete levels.

703
00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.560
Like they tested his cardio and his vo two Max is like off the charts and it's

704
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:05.700
because he's usually got a hundred pounds of elk on his back and he's climbing

705
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.060
uphill and it's 9,000 fucking feet elevation.

706
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.550
And he's,

707
00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.800
he does that all the time.

708
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:11.321
It's crazy.

709
00:19:11.321 --> 00:19:12.690
He lives in Reno and he's,

710
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:14.010
he does a lot of his hunt there.

711
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:15.300
A lot of his hunter mountain hunts.

712
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.260
He does mountain Hudson,

713
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.730
New Zealand during the off season.

714
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.250
He's constantly climbing up mountains.

715
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:20.520
Yeah.

716
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.420
So your,

717
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.950
your lung capacity,

718
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.390
your ability to kind of shape,

719
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.970
it's a different thing because you're also doing it all day.

720
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.360
What will fit now was telling me that he took these bodybuilders out with them,

721
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:31.500
these powerlifter guys,

722
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.200
and then there's a big strong guys and you know,

723
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.090
so like what we're going to do is going to require,

724
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:36.331
you know,

725
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:38.040
a lot of endurance and it's like guys like,

726
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:38.430
we're fine,

727
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.450
we're in incredible shape.

728
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.230
Don't worry about it.

729
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.480
He said literally 30 minutes in,

730
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.940
they were throwing up 30 minutes in.

731
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.480
Wow.

732
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:45.841
He's like,

733
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:47.070
this is a long day.

734
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.050
Like do you understand that we're going to do this for eight hours?

735
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:51.000
And you're throwing up because when you have,

736
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.740
if you look at a guy like Rinella,

737
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.220
okay,

738
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.220
Rinella probably weighs one seven 65 one 70 somewhere around there.

739
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.470
He's a leaning naming,

740
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.220
yeah.

741
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.890
Lean and thin and been doing it his whole life.

742
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.230
And his specialty is mountain hunting.

743
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.850
So he's constantly climbing,

744
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.150
which is great because he can give you all the tips on like gear and what,

745
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.270
what kind of shoe that makes a big goddamn different types to different types of

746
00:20:15.271 --> 00:20:16.050
shoes.

747
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.290
One cause I knew that they were probably gonna get soaked and one which worked

748
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:22.920
out really good that she sneeze and these other ones well and won't name that

749
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:23.790
suck the fat one.

750
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.661
They were terrible.

751
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:25.680
They just were slippery.

752
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.600
They didn't have the same kind of grip.

753
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.990
And you know if you listen to reno he'll like give you like the low down and

754
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:32.910
this is the shit to where get this because of that,

755
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.020
get that because of this.

756
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.610
But his body is,

757
00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:37.860
doesn't have a lot of mass,

758
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.401
you know,

759
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:40.050
I weigh 30 pounds more than him,

760
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.520
so I'm sure that him,

761
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:45.540
I weigh 30 pounds more than him and I'm carrying a pack and a gun and all these

762
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:46.410
things I'm not used to.

763
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.560
And you know,

764
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:51.700
you're constantly trying to go like if you're bigger than that,

765
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:53.380
like a big power will builder guy,

766
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:56.170
a big power lifter one was 250 pound characters.

767
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.820
That extra 50 pounds,

768
00:20:57.821 --> 00:20:59.650
we'll fucking SAP your heart.

769
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:00.250
Man.

770
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:00.821
Did they do,

771
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:01.230
how did he,

772
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.063
how did they do?

773
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.500
Yeah,

774
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.540
they were throwing up a half an hour in there were done.

775
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.310
He's like literally they were like,

776
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.061
you know,

777
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:07.871
an hour into the trip,

778
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:09.880
they're stopped hands on their knees.

779
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.090
You don't train is different body type.

780
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.520
Well,

781
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.740
power lifters are terrible.

782
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:15.351
Like when you,

783
00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:17.050
you see him like doing Jujitsu,

784
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.900
it's got Marius [inaudible].

785
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.130
No,

786
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.850
he is super fucked man in the world for a while,

787
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.290
but just unbelievable.

788
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:28.291
Brute of a man started fighting MMA and Tim Silvia who has like,

789
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.540
Tim's a great fighter but he does not have a good body,

790
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.290
you know?

791
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.880
Sorry Tim.

792
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.713
I feel this way.

793
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.870
I mean look,

794
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:38.710
he when he was in his best shape like versus Rico Rodriguez when he won the UFC

795
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:39.910
heavyweight title Ultra Lombard.

796
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:40.744
In other words,

797
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.010
it's just genetic.

798
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:42.821
It's just genetic.

799
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:43.990
It's a ton of percent genetic.

800
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.190
Mean pigeon toed.

801
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.150
That's genetic.

802
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.600
I mean I think Kelly star it says that it's not,

803
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:50.883
he's probably right.

804
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.950
I've always felt like people who walk like that,

805
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.000
it's just the way they're born.

806
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.690
But yeah,

807
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.210
I bet that could be corrected and he thinks it's emulating.

808
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.970
Kelly Kelly who created this crazy ball do,

809
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:02.560
you're supposed to roll on your back.

810
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:03.430
This Wad,

811
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.690
I forget what this is called.

812
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:05.680
Workout of the day.

813
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:06.401
I forgot what that's called.

814
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:07.031
Supernova.

815
00:22:07.031 --> 00:22:10.060
That's what's called this is the latest and greatest of those things that your

816
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:12.130
role on to massage your back.

817
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:12.730
Oh,

818
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.960
I bought three of these.

819
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.100
They're fucking amazing.

820
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.240
I don't want to go anywhere without one.

821
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:16.990
Yeah.

822
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.650
One of 'em [inaudible] students gave me this and uh,

823
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.980
I just started ordering them to leave them in the office,

824
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.490
lead him around the house there is awesome.

825
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.593
But um,

826
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.260
anyway,

827
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.980
Sylvia who is not a bodybuilder and he's not a power lifter,

828
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.210
he's just a really strong guy.

829
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.051
He fought,

830
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:35.050
puts Nowicki and beat the shit out of him cause he tired of him,

831
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.240
dragged him into deep water and then fucked him up.

832
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.500
But put you analyses,

833
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.050
goddamn crazy for challenging Tim Silvia,

834
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:43.520
former UFC heavyweight champion afterlife.

835
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.470
That is nuts.

836
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:46.090
You have like two MMA fights,

837
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.750
light him up and he built like this.

838
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.550
It's really weird.

839
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.600
He was talking about this because today I,

840
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.530
my wife was having breakfast with um,

841
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.400
uh,

842
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.860
the wife of two former NFL,

843
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.650
like grates are really good players.

844
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.573
Giants,

845
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.331
Andre Carter,

846
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:03.250
who played for 13 years as a defensive end,

847
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:03.851
he six,

848
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:04.780
five to 50.

849
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.651
It looks like he doesn't,

850
00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:06.820
he's just like a different kind of human being.

851
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:11.530
And Marvell Smith who was d tackle for the Steelers for like 10 years and they

852
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:12.191
want to come hunting.

853
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:12.491
She was like,

854
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:12.641
oh,

855
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.540
they would love to come hunting.

856
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:17.800
And the first thing I thought it was these men are two 50 and 320 pounds or

857
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:18.940
whatever it respectively.

858
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.860
And I don't know if they can,

859
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:23.560
and with their knees after playing football for 13 years,

860
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:25.300
it's going to be very hard for them to climb a mountain.

861
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.411
A lot of those guys,

862
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:27.660
they're done when they're old,

863
00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:28.160
different.

864
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.480
It's,

865
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:28.720
you know,

866
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.501
it's just a different guy.

867
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:32.530
It's also when you have damage to those primary joints,

868
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.700
hips and knees,

869
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:33.971
you know,

870
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:35.520
you really see like the,

871
00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:38.470
the loss of mobility is pretty goddamn substantial.

872
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.910
Although apparently they have pretty amazing new artificial knees.

873
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.890
Like they're getting better and better at it.

874
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.260
Yeah,

875
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:45.591
dude,

876
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.161
they're growing.

877
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:47.390
Dick's what?

878
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.050
Yes.

879
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:53.050
I just tweeted it today and they've done this for folks who have,

880
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.560
um,

881
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:54.831
you know,

882
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:55.610
like issues,

883
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.290
micro phalluses or mutilation injury,

884
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.090
a circumcision,

885
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:02.661
injuries,

886
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:03.441
things along those lines,

887
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:04.690
which is yeah.

888
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.870
Anything along those lines.

889
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.390
So they're growing ticks.

890
00:24:07.391 --> 00:24:07.671
Yeah,

891
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:07.911
yeah,

892
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:08.320
yeah.

893
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.780
Um,

894
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.201
Jamie,

895
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:11.910
if you go to my Twitter tweeter,

896
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:12.800
um,

897
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.990
there's a dude named Vincent Salazar who,

898
00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:15.230
uh,

899
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.910
Vincent Salads are 11,

900
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.660
and it says a,

901
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.640
it may not be his,

902
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:20.421
his tweet to me is,

903
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.440
it may not be a pill,

904
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.330
but it will be a boob job for men.

905
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.010
I don't know what he meant,

906
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.270
but maybe their laboratory,

907
00:24:25.271 --> 00:24:25.800
they grown.

908
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.520
Tina says tissue the way they do with the other tissue.

909
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.413
I didn't read it,

910
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.160
I gave it a cursory glance,

911
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.280
but apparently there are about five years away from the small there.

912
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:34.820
I want to,

913
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.031
well,

914
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:35.960
these are just cells.

915
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.100
[inaudible] cells.

916
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.800
They're,

917
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.180
I mean,

918
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.050
they're five years away from being able to grow laboratory dicks.

919
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.160
I want something with halfed that that folds over when I'm holding it to pay,

920
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.530
I want it to fold like in half.

921
00:24:48.531 --> 00:24:49.700
I want to have a lot leftover.

922
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:50.480
What about this,

923
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.220
would you take like say,

924
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.060
do you think the dudes who have like medium sized Dicks,

925
00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.410
I'm going to take a chance and get their Dick lopped off and get a new one put

926
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.400
on hold.

927
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.170
Don't that their body's going to accept it.

928
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:04.490
That's a very,

929
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:06.060
very um,

930
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.850
sacred part of a man,

931
00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:08.030
right?

932
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.863
I mean that's,

933
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.010
that's a huge,

934
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:13.340
like if you were going into that as a venture capitalist with the assumption

935
00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:14.510
that men would do that,

936
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.850
I would tell you not to put your money into it.

937
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.000
I would tell you to put your money into it because there's some dudes out there

938
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:21.110
with some one inch decks.

939
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.340
Well that's a whole different story.

940
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:24.200
But if you have a medium deck yet,

941
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:24.621
imagine,

942
00:25:24.621 --> 00:25:25.100
you know,

943
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.000
a medium Deca,

944
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:26.980
cause my mom,

945
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.750
she got to do something giant.

946
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.620
But there was a guy,

947
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.880
there's this guy that uh,

948
00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.120
it was a performance artist and part of his performance art was that he would

949
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:38.000
take all his clothes off and he had a dick that was,

950
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:42.170
and I'm not bullshitting the size of the last digit of my pinky.

951
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.950
It was incorrect.

952
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.310
It was sending enough acting classes and seen enough nude scenes and there are

953
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.960
some dudes and one dude,

954
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:49.310
it was just a macho guy.

955
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.960
He was a hairdresser and he did a naked scene and I am telling you,

956
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.220
I am telling you,

957
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.930
I can see just the head of it in a,

958
00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.850
in a sea of black hair,

959
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.320
we used to have fear factor and there was a naked fear factor,

960
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:07.080
the one and only naked fear factor where we got in trouble for it because we

961
00:26:07.081 --> 00:26:09.830
made these people do a naked fashion show where they took their clothes off.

962
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:12.660
They went out in the runway and he spun around and this one guy who's just

963
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.670
fucking yoked up,

964
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:16.070
dude looked like it was a like a macho guy.

965
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:19.220
He hit the tiny as well and he talked about it beforehand.

966
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:19.461
He's like,

967
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:19.791
all right,

968
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:20.510
here we go.

969
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.280
And he went out there like a fucking stud.

970
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.020
Good for him.

971
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.610
God bless him.

972
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:24.443
You know what?

973
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.640
Yeah.

974
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.121
He was like,

975
00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:26.421
you know what?

976
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:27.254
Here's my Dick.

977
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.850
I got a personality and I'm,

978
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:30.440
and I can bench more than everybody in this room.

979
00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:31.191
While he's like,

980
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:31.431
you know,

981
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:32.150
hey man,

982
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.830
I didn't fucking fail Dick School.

983
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.330
That's just where I was born with.

984
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.611
Yeah,

985
00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:36.590
it's all good.

986
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.550
But maybe he would lop it off and get one of these giant ones.

987
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.421
Yeah.

988
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.980
I mean if you could add tissue to your tea

989
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.760
<v 2>or Wang,</v>

990
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:44.941
hey,

991
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:45.550
by the way,

992
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:45.940
wonderful.

993
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.000
Most guys were clubbing sticks would be like,

994
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.171
oh,

995
00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:48.871
I had another end.

996
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:50.010
No fucking way.

997
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.370
No dream.

998
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.700
Yeah.

999
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.750
That's some stuff that would be like those crazy girls who have breast implants

1000
00:26:57.751 --> 00:27:02.460
that are just an believably ridiculous like basketball sized and they can't,

1001
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.450
they want to get them bigger.

1002
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.340
That's a lot of guys that there's this,

1003
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.960
there's a lot of guys,

1004
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.880
and I don't know if it's just the gay community,

1005
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:10.290
but that the dispatch they did,

1006
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:14.730
it was two guys in the gay community who were shooting their dicks with silicone

1007
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.370
liquid silicone and sailing too.

1008
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:21.420
They do that and so it created this and the problem was it just created this

1009
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:26.100
amorphous blob that they would stuff into jeans and they'd be like,

1010
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:26.911
check this out.

1011
00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.530
Sorry about the Dick.

1012
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:28.971
Yeah,

1013
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:29.640
but sorry,

1014
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.170
piece lumpy.

1015
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.201
Just stretching.

1016
00:27:32.201 --> 00:27:33.260
Is Sergio Valenti,

1017
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.490
all fucking the outside of it as all pudgy and awe.

1018
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.520
Dimpled,

1019
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.470
all dimpled like cottage cheese.

1020
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:40.831
Dick,

1021
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:41.664
what's that bump?

1022
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.390
I don't know.

1023
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.920
Silicon Gone Awry.

1024
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.220
Damn silicon.

1025
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.450
So unpredictable.

1026
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.500
When you think about like I'm predict people have a cellulite on their legs.

1027
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.270
Imagine if you've got that on your Dick.

1028
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.040
Look if a cellulite Dick,

1029
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.720
have you ever had like some of those medical journals?

1030
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:02.721
I sat next to a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon and she was going through her

1031
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.450
iPad and she had pictures and I was sitting next door.

1032
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.580
She was asking me about acting and I was,

1033
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.710
she was showing me the key and some of them,

1034
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:14.780
she was really an,

1035
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.930
she was covering the faces of these patients with their hands so I wouldn't see

1036
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:21.150
their faces cause she was that professional.

1037
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:21.984
Even on a plane,

1038
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.000
she was trying to protect their privacy or whatever.

1039
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.480
I saw this guy had a growth on his body,

1040
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.300
on his shoulder,

1041
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:28.771
looked like a,

1042
00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:31.710
a shoulder pat of skin of cauliflower.

1043
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.323
And I said,

1044
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.070
how do you take that off?

1045
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.491
And she said,

1046
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:36.150
you don't.

1047
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:36.391
I said,

1048
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:36.811
what do you mean?

1049
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:37.140
She goes,

1050
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.790
it's just too full of blood vessels.

1051
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:39.624
He would die.

1052
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.850
This is part of his body and he has to have it.

1053
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:42.121
I go,

1054
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:42.910
so what did,

1055
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.910
he just leaves a giant flap of cauliflower on his back and shoulder stead.

1056
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.241
Yeah.

1057
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:50.880
Unfortunately it's just a deformity.

1058
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:51.570
Wow.

1059
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.341
And there's so many,

1060
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:53.970
or you see those medical journals and you're like,

1061
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:54.780
oh boy.

1062
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.381
So people,

1063
00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:55.920
you know,

1064
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.630
don't realize how lucky you are.

1065
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.280
I can Canada living in civilization will,

1066
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:02.941
we're in Canada.

1067
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:03.321
We're in the line.

1068
00:29:03.321 --> 00:29:06.810
I mean Alaska because our America looks like it's Canada should be Canada.

1069
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.741
It's British Columbia.

1070
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:09.570
It's like around the corner where we stole it from Russia.

1071
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:10.230
Right.

1072
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.950
The deal.

1073
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.270
Probably they can have it back.

1074
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.223
No,

1075
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.501
fuck.

1076
00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.620
That place is awesome man.

1077
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.990
Alaska good people in the last,

1078
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.590
oh well that's one of the things that I realized when I went to anchorage with

1079
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.700
Ari when we went fishing.

1080
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:22.620
And then we did some shows up there though.

1081
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.760
The bears tooth,

1082
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:24.721
the,

1083
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.110
um,

1084
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:30.110
the thing about Alaska is that there's this insane wilderness around them and

1085
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:32.460
there's not a shit ton of people.

1086
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.550
So they developed this like different kind of community.

1087
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.151
It's like a,

1088
00:29:36.151 --> 00:29:38.130
even though anchorage is a real city,

1089
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.320
there's like a nice bond.

1090
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.290
I think it's because they have to,

1091
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.250
they may have to rely

1092
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.390
<v 1>on each other in a real way.</v>

1093
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.370
Bears look,

1094
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:45.611
dude,

1095
00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:46.690
when we were in anchorage,

1096
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.350
there was just that year a fucking kid on campus was killed by a moose.

1097
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.243
What?

1098
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.773
Whoa.

1099
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:53.771
Well listen,

1100
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:54.700
we met a guy,

1101
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:55.170
Matt.

1102
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.450
Uh,

1103
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.380
what's his last name?

1104
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.220
Um,

1105
00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.053
Matt.

1106
00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:59.620
Which guy?

1107
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.670
The Guy who took care of us.

1108
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:00.910
Who?

1109
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:01.743
Matt from Alaska.

1110
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.961
Yeah.

1111
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:04.360
Matt from Alaska who drove us to the airport,

1112
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.490
sent our bags.

1113
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.360
Just did us a solid that most people would never do an La Matt Hamilton,

1114
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:10.961
Matt Hamilton.

1115
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.150
You handed them your very expensive,

1116
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.073
you know,

1117
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.590
stuff.

1118
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.950
Yeah.

1119
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.250
And he's,

1120
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:15.461
well,

1121
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:16.270
he's a good dude.

1122
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.570
You know,

1123
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:16.990
you can,

1124
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.430
you,

1125
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:22.270
you get a sense of people like in these communities where they're,

1126
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.523
they're just,

1127
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.040
it's not like the hustle and bustle of New York City where there's a million

1128
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:30.340
rats all stuck in a maze and everybody's fucking fighting for the last chroma

1129
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:32.410
cheese and jammed up and traffic.

1130
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:32.831
No,

1131
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:33.940
these folks are fishing.

1132
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.850
That guy was offering us fucking halibut.

1133
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.040
You know,

1134
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.060
he wants some how it got some frozen,

1135
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:38.750
how a deer I can run back and get deer.

1136
00:30:38.751 --> 00:30:42.010
I mean he caught 160 pound.

1137
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:44.950
How Labatt that said person.

1138
00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.400
Yeah.

1139
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:45.581
It's,

1140
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:49.630
I mean a halibut's like literally probably almost the size of this desk.

1141
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.800
They were sitting there how big?

1142
00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:51.850
It's like a giant flounder.

1143
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.621
Looks at us.

1144
00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:54.010
Flounder on the phone to family.

1145
00:30:54.011 --> 00:30:54.320
Yeah.

1146
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:54.850
Yeah.

1147
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.630
That's an amazing,

1148
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.450
amazing part of the world and the fishing there is just,

1149
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.070
the waters are so rich.

1150
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.040
Alaska truly is like the last wilderness,

1151
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.460
the wilderness.

1152
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.860
I love those shows.

1153
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:05.940
Like,

1154
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.620
I don't know if you ever watch them but like they had a bunch of Zeros.

1155
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.441
Do you watch them?

1156
00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:10.330
I haven't watched any of them.

1157
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:11.380
Fucking great man.

1158
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.200
Life below zero is the best at all.

1159
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.930
Those,

1160
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:14.621
there's Alaska,

1161
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:15.251
the last frontier,

1162
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:15.971
which is pretty good too,

1163
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:18.130
but I caught a little fuckery on that show.

1164
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:18.700
He did.

1165
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.550
Yeah.

1166
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.870
They're doing some fucking reality TV show bullshit.

1167
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.890
Like they had a bear that was there and they were running away from the bear and

1168
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:27.240
um,

1169
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.450
they were fishing on this river.

1170
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:30.430
The guy and his wife were fishing on the river and they're like,

1171
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:31.510
we got to get away from this bear.

1172
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.360
The bear's eating filleted salmon.

1173
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.920
So they baited the bear,

1174
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.310
they baited the bear to get there and then they get film.

1175
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.040
That's annoying.

1176
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.140
The bears eating salmon.

1177
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.180
I'm looking at these clean like filet marks where the,

1178
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:44.421
the,

1179
00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:44.950
the,

1180
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.140
the,

1181
00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.080
the filets we'll remove from the body,

1182
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:47.980
but the head and the tail,

1183
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:49.000
we're remained.

1184
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.980
It wasn't anything that a bear did.

1185
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.640
Bear didn't like catch that salmon and eat it there and they didn't catch any

1186
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:55.270
salmon.

1187
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.320
So it was just bullshit.

1188
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.190
They're just bay.

1189
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:57.671
They were cool.

1190
00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:58.030
The bears,

1191
00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.020
we've got to get out of here.

1192
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.420
You can kind of tell whenever they're acting a little bit too.

1193
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:02.254
Yeah,

1194
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.130
it's unfortunate.

1195
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:05.530
But that always happens in those God damn shows,

1196
00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:06.190
man.

1197
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.730
They,

1198
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.500
they run out of shit to do,

1199
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.940
but they follow up five different people or six different people.

1200
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.690
And there's always something that these people are doing because they have to

1201
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.760
prepare for like the river rising,

1202
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.550
they have to prepare for bears are coming into camp.

1203
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:23.380
They have to prepare for all these different things.

1204
00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:24.760
So fascinating stuff.

1205
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.600
Nature,

1206
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.410
nature.

1207
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.243
You know,

1208
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.280
it's interesting because if you look at anything in nature,

1209
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.540
including human beings,

1210
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.890
whether it's,

1211
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:33.401
you know,

1212
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.320
an ant or a spider rolling something,

1213
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:35.741
a Web,

1214
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:36.574
whatever it is,

1215
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.680
everybody in nature is constantly fighting nature.

1216
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.010
It's a

1217
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.580
<v 3>fight.</v>

1218
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.690
It just to survive.

1219
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.920
You want to survive out there.

1220
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.290
You can see why men,

1221
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.620
men has always kind of pitted himself against nature.

1222
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.370
Just the constant struggle of trying to push yourself into a situation where you

1223
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.200
don't have to deal and contend with nature.

1224
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.430
We've done a pretty good job of it,

1225
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.091
you know,

1226
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:58.160
by by figuring out ways to innovate,

1227
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.990
ways to control our environment stuff.

1228
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:00.740
But if you,

1229
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.890
if you had to scratch out a living and looking at animals,

1230
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.460
I mean you can watch deer who don't move very much cause they have to conserve

1231
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:10.910
energy and they have to stay in one area and they eat and that one area then

1232
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:12.380
they moved down to lower land.

1233
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:15.350
But a lot of times guess what happens that people don't realize with deer they

1234
00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:16.220
starve to death.

1235
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:16.761
Oh,

1236
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:17.451
not just,

1237
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:18.620
not sometimes.

1238
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.580
Like often,

1239
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.290
often it happens all the time.

1240
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.190
It's brutal.

1241
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.080
Most of these people that are against hunting or the think that like somehow or

1242
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.650
another that nature is supposed to be this like peaceful thing.

1243
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.850
They don't understand what the reality of the life of these animals is.

1244
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:40.090
Teddy Roosevelt had a great quote on people who don't understand hunting and

1245
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:44.900
people have a problem with it who loved nature and he wrote that death by

1246
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:45.734
violence,

1247
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.630
death by cold,

1248
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.550
death by starvation.

1249
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.760
These are the normal ends of the noble and stately creatures of the Wilderness.

1250
00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.100
The sentimentalist who prattle about the peaceful life of nature,

1251
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.993
the peaceful,

1252
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:02.720
you know,

1253
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.270
that's what he wrote.

1254
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.370
Peaceful life of nature.

1255
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.290
Do not understand.

1256
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.350
It's utter mercilessness life is hard and cruel and these,

1257
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:15.470
oh,

1258
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:16.303
okay,

1259
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.530
well this is a fucked up speech.

1260
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.940
And in what the sentimentalist call a state of nature.

1261
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.131
Yeah,

1262
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:26.850
it's in Hobbs said,

1263
00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:27.471
it's short,

1264
00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:28.304
brutish.

1265
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:28.931
What does the,

1266
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:29.570
what does the x,

1267
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.380
the expression,

1268
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.213
um,

1269
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.140
short and brutish

1270
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.260
nature is tough.

1271
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:36.981
Well,

1272
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:37.671
you know what it is,

1273
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:38.900
is it's just indifferent.

1274
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.540
That was one of the things that we said when we got to this place where like

1275
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.730
when we sat out there and looked out off the top of those mountains and we

1276
00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:47.600
looked at all of these,

1277
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.850
just feel so insignificant.

1278
00:34:48.851 --> 00:34:49.670
Oh no people,

1279
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.301
no people.

1280
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:50.931
Enormous,

1281
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:51.890
enormous place.

1282
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.510
Not a fucking person to be seen.

1283
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.070
And one of the first things we were thinking,

1284
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:55.820
it was like,

1285
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.780
it's so indifferent.

1286
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:57.740
It just doesn't give a fuck.

1287
00:34:57.741 --> 00:34:59.870
It doesn't give a fuck if you're here or well,

1288
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:01.130
Rinella was saying also that,

1289
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:01.341
you know,

1290
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:04.040
the native Americans that lived there were,

1291
00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:04.400
you know,

1292
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.091
hundreds of years ago,

1293
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:05.450
whatever,

1294
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.130
we're stayed on the coast.

1295
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.050
They had a lot of shellfish and fished.

1296
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.600
They didn't really go into the interior to get deer.

1297
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.580
So difficult to do.

1298
00:35:13.581 --> 00:35:13.881
I mean,

1299
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:14.121
you know,

1300
00:35:14.121 --> 00:35:15.710
especially before they had firearms,

1301
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.521
it was very,

1302
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:16.930
I mean,

1303
00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.720
imagine,

1304
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.051
I mean,

1305
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:20.540
you want to shoot an animal with a bow and Arrow,

1306
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.730
especially in old school bone Arrow,

1307
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.000
you must get inside of 30 yards,

1308
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:27.891
40 yards,

1309
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:29.150
you're fucking really pushing it,

1310
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:29.870
man.

1311
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.280
Even with a compound bow,

1312
00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:34.220
a 40 yard shot is very difficult to be accurate with.

1313
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.810
And those old bows,

1314
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:38.070
like a lot of them just didn't have the amount of power

1315
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.491
<v 1>to pull.</v>

1316
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:41.880
Like the Mongols had these crazy fucking bows,

1317
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.630
but they required like 160 pounds of pole.

1318
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.830
Like you could probably shoot at a reliable 50 60 yard distance with those if

1319
00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:50.760
you got really good at it.

1320
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:53.940
But you're fucking practicing with those goddamn things every day.

1321
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.450
Sure.

1322
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.440
If you have a spear,

1323
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.670
get the fuck Outta here.

1324
00:35:56.671 --> 00:35:57.810
How far can you throw a spear?

1325
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.800
Can you even throw a spear?

1326
00:35:58.801 --> 00:35:59.634
10 yards?

1327
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.001
I mean,

1328
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:02.490
how far can you reliably throw a spear,

1329
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.030
especially to make it then 10 throw it accurately and hit an animal and kill it

1330
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.660
or graze it and it's gonna run off and go nowhere near you.

1331
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.320
So they,

1332
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:10.660
they,

1333
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.000
they hung around where the water was because shellfish and netting,

1334
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:19.100
you can net fish and there was a more reliable way to capture me.

1335
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.510
Will you,

1336
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.831
when they,

1337
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:23.730
when who was taught to tell a story about how the Inuits would bend a bone,

1338
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.630
they'd bend a bone and they would cover it in fat.

1339
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.830
Yes.

1340
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.760
And then the,

1341
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:34.761
and it would be frozen fat and then the polar bear would come eat the bone and

1342
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:36.000
the bone would open,

1343
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.080
expand in the,

1344
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.730
in a polar bear stomach or throat.

1345
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.800
And suddenly it would basically take three days to die and they would follow it

1346
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.710
until it died and then take just for the coat because they,

1347
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.790
that's how they kept warm.

1348
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.061
Well,

1349
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:49.650
one of the ways he used to kill wolves would,

1350
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:50.850
they would take an a knife,

1351
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.330
like a razor sharp knife and they want embedded into the ground and put blood on

1352
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:54.960
the knife.

1353
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.930
So the wolves would come along and lick the knife and cut their tongue open and

1354
00:36:57.931 --> 00:36:58.764
bleed to death.

1355
00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.551
And because they keep,

1356
00:36:59.551 --> 00:36:59.671
well,

1357
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:02.220
they would keep licking and cleaning and licking and bleeding.

1358
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.210
They would taste the blood.

1359
00:37:03.211 --> 00:37:03.870
Yeah.

1360
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.230
Yeah.

1361
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.041
And then they would just die.

1362
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:05.850
They're fucking dumb.

1363
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.320
Cunt wolves kind of genius.

1364
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.213
That's pretty brilliant.

1365
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:08.521
Well,

1366
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:08.700
you know,

1367
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.200
people are ingenious when they have to stay alive and we obviously didn't have

1368
00:37:13.201 --> 00:37:13.861
to stay alive.

1369
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:14.790
We had meals,

1370
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:15.451
we had food,

1371
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:15.720
we had,

1372
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:15.901
you know,

1373
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:19.110
we brought apple and protein bars and all kinds of shit and planning though

1374
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.741
plenty of blood.

1375
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:23.100
Think about if we had to live off the land while we were there.

1376
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.270
What the fuck did we found?

1377
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.040
We found a couple salamanders.

1378
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.240
We saw a duck,

1379
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.830
six or seven blueberries.

1380
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.431
Yeah.

1381
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:30.870
There was these blueberries.

1382
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.250
There was microscopic,

1383
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.881
the height of it,

1384
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:33.870
like a head of a match,

1385
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.330
blueberries and they tasted like powder.

1386
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.590
It tastes like nothing.

1387
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.670
Good luck surviving.

1388
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:39.504
Ladies and gentlemen,

1389
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.970
I eat a handful of them and one of them was kind of sweet,

1390
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.100
but like you go to whole foods,

1391
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.140
you get this fucking choosy GMO blue birds.

1392
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.000
I know where they came from.

1393
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.863
They who cares.

1394
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.460
Tennis ball sized bike down on them and blow up in your mouth and even then

1395
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:53.760
you're like,

1396
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.080
I need more food.

1397
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.113
You know,

1398
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.660
and death by violence.

1399
00:37:57.661 --> 00:37:59.700
Death by cold death by starvation.

1400
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.860
Teddy Roosevelt was a bad motherfucker.

1401
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:02.490
Yup.

1402
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.480
The normal ends,

1403
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.831
wasn't it?

1404
00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:06.960
Teddy Roosevelt who designated the Yellowstone park is a national park.

1405
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:07.590
I don't know.

1406
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.790
And Yosemite I believe.

1407
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.840
Did he?

1408
00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.140
Yup.

1409
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:10.973
Smart man.

1410
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.873
Yes he was.

1411
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.560
That's a good place for national park.

1412
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.870
That's an unbelievably beautiful place.

1413
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:18.660
It's going to kill everybody eventually with the Super Volcano.

1414
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.260
I've been thinking about nothing else since you told me about that.

1415
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.383
Terrifying.

1416
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.600
That's the Black Swan.

1417
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:25.081
As they say,

1418
00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:27.000
that's like everybody's going about their life and all of a sudden,

1419
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:27.361
guess what?

1420
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:30.060
There's a supervolcano that could eradicate life on earth.

1421
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.260
Well not just one.

1422
00:38:31.261 --> 00:38:34.830
There's six of them worldwide and two of them are in California,

1423
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:35.980
which really crazy.

1424
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.020
<v 3>Got Basically big zits on the earth.</v>

1425
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:38.891
Yeah,

1426
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:39.190
there's,

1427
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.440
there's supervolcanoes everywhere.

1428
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.910
There's super volcanoes all over the world and there's not just one in

1429
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:46.660
Yellowstone,

1430
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.051
there's a,

1431
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:49.150
there's a gigantic super volcano.

1432
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:54.151
I think we said an Indonesia that they think is responsible for the reason why

1433
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.960
there is only,

1434
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:56.800
you know,

1435
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.800
they believe that 75,000 years ago this super volcano in Indonesia exploded and

1436
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:03.910
when it exploded,

1437
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:09.150
they think that that's why all human beings have some sort of a,

1438
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.800
a relationship to each other.

1439
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.460
That we all came from an original group of human beings 74,000 years ago.

1440
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.390
Toba,

1441
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.200
it's a,

1442
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.720
it's a Caldera volcano in Sumatra.

1443
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.000
It's ready for this hold onto your Dick.

1444
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.980
1080 square miles.

1445
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.380
So people are living on top of it as we speak.

1446
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.630
The will that I don't think they,

1447
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.660
I don't know if they are not,

1448
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:32.170
but it's in,

1449
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:32.830
it's in India.

1450
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.820
It's in Sumatra,

1451
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:34.654
Indonesia,

1452
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.470
and it's the only super volcano in existence that can be described as

1453
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:40.300
Yellowstone's big sister.

1454
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.010
74,000 years ago.

1455
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:47.011
Toba erupted and objected several thousand times more material than erupted from

1456
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:52.660
Mount Saint Helens in 1980 several thousand times more.

1457
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.580
Some researchers think that Toba is ancient super eruption and the global cold

1458
00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:01.210
spell it triggered might explain a mystery in the human genome.

1459
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420
Our genes suggest that we all come from a few thousand people just tens of

1460
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.780
thousands of years ago instead of from a much older,

1461
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:13.840
bigger lineage as fossil evidence testifies.

1462
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.730
So we have the fossil evidence,

1463
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:19.110
which shows them a much older ProMag broader lineage.

1464
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.570
But the people of today all come from a few thousand people.

1465
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:25.090
That might've been the only fucking human beings that survived.

1466
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:28.550
It's Goddamn supervolcano 74,000 so that's why they can trace like a hot,

1467
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.200
like a Hasidic Jews in Finland or in Africans.

1468
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.531
Yeah.

1469
00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:33.220
To Africans.

1470
00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:33.520
Yeah.

1471
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.510
That's unbelievable.

1472
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.820
And that's all 74,000 years ago,

1473
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:37.390
man.

1474
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.661
So,

1475
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:37.961
so,

1476
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:38.794
so,

1477
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.870
so then the,

1478
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.080
but we do find with the genome that some people have some cro-magnon genes and I

1479
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:46.720
think,

1480
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.840
well we are cro magnon I think you're thinking of neanderthal nine.

1481
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.220
I mean,

1482
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:50.980
yeah,

1483
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.701
well there's,

1484
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:51.941
there's,

1485
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:53.780
I think there's obviously I'm an idiot.

1486
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.030
Don't listen to me Google this,

1487
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.600
but,

1488
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:55.930
um,

1489
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.740
I think there's debate on this because I think that some believe that these

1490
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:03.970
genomes are from a common ancestor and that I think there's debate as to whether

1491
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:06.730
or not people fuck neanderthals or neanderthals fuck people.

1492
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:10.240
We interbred like I've joked around about it that my,

1493
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:13.960
I'm pretty sure someone in my past fucked a monkey.

1494
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.850
Like when people were like,

1495
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:18.640
just starting to not be monkeys anymore.

1496
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.780
Somebody's sex of all,

1497
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:20.614
you've got long lines.

1498
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.210
Somebody let me just one more time.

1499
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.540
One more time soon to get back in there and somehow the monkey got pregnant and

1500
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.321
like what the fuck?

1501
00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:28.810
And then that's where my line came from,

1502
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.340
but semi and jeans.

1503
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.210
But I think that,

1504
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:31.540
um,

1505
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.220
there's debate as to whether or not humans interbred

1506
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.270
<v 1>with neanderthals and that's why or whether or not we have a common ancestor.</v>

1507
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:40.850
I don't think it's been completely figured out yet,

1508
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.450
but if neanderthals were around for sure somebody would fuck one.

1509
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:45.380
Yeah.

1510
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.090
People thought these pick one person.

1511
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.500
I've seen people fuck chicken.

1512
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.760
That's it.

1513
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.640
My buddy was a cop.

1514
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:51.950
He found a guy fucking a chicken in a car.

1515
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.420
There was a family man and he had a chicken under a fucking towel and he goes,

1516
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:57.254
what are you doing?

1517
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.280
You guys love thing?

1518
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:58.761
First of all,

1519
00:41:58.761 --> 00:41:59.594
I love that expression.

1520
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.231
Family man.

1521
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:01.064
He's a family man.

1522
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.080
He's a family man in San Francisco.

1523
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.090
He's fucking his chicken under a towel.

1524
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:05.811
Excuse me,

1525
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:06.081
sir.

1526
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:06.914
Is that illegal?

1527
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.840
I think it is illegal.

1528
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:11.480
Like they can arrest you for cruelty to animals or something.

1529
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:12.440
But then again you eat chicken.

1530
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.303
I don't know.

1531
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.461
Yeah.

1532
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:14.900
It's not weird that they had to make,

1533
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.650
it's like public indecency.

1534
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.930
I think they get you on stuff like that.

1535
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:19.460
But you were fucking a chicken.

1536
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:19.911
Although,

1537
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:20.744
how about this?

1538
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.690
That's a very good question because yes,

1539
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:24.051
your honor.

1540
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:26.990
I fucked the chicken under a towel.

1541
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:28.820
It's my thing free country,

1542
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.200
you kill an eat chickens so I don't know.

1543
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:33.680
And by,

1544
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.800
and I should be able to fuck the chicken then kill and eat it.

1545
00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.720
Technically kill it and then fuck it.

1546
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.130
But that's like you're,

1547
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:41.240
you're a Weirdo.

1548
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.200
Yeah.

1549
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.160
Kill it and then fuck it.

1550
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:45.520
You're like some sort of more feeling.

1551
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.420
I wonder if that's a law though.

1552
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.250
I have to joke about it.

1553
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.940
You heard the joke?

1554
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.450
No.

1555
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.380
Well it's a bit about you could you,

1556
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.830
you can kill an animal but you know a lot of fuck it.

1557
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.920
But we can do is take like a meal size portion and use it to jerk off with it.

1558
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.040
Like someone came into your house,

1559
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:02.450
you jerk it off with a chicken cutlet.

1560
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:03.001
Be like,

1561
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:03.531
what the fuck?

1562
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:04.820
I can't have my privacy.

1563
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:04.970
Yeah,

1564
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.460
exactly.

1565
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.160
Like,

1566
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.040
like chicken.

1567
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.970
But if as long as it's like no one would stop you like look,

1568
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:11.210
look,

1569
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.780
okay,

1570
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.501
a fleshlight,

1571
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:15.260
what's a fleshlight fleshlight it's something that resembles fleshed.

1572
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:17.180
It's made out of like some sort of a rubber,

1573
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.040
whatever,

1574
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.651
a proxy.

1575
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:18.831
I don't know.

1576
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:20.990
What the fuck is it made out of polymer.

1577
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.340
You're,

1578
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.020
you're putting your penis in that because it feels like flesh,

1579
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.290
right?

1580
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:29.270
Well you see how green would it be to take an actual chicken cutlet used to jerk

1581
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:33.500
off with warming up in a microwave so it feels like flesh or you let it sit at

1582
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:34.160
room temperature,

1583
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.993
whatever.

1584
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.740
You jerk off with it and then you cook it and eat it.

1585
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.040
Yeah,

1586
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.920
that's like you're making best use of all the materials.

1587
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.710
But that would be probably,

1588
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:43.820
they couldn't do anything to you,

1589
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.000
but if you fucked a chicken they could probably do something to you.

1590
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.271
Well,

1591
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:48.140
Jonathan Haidt,

1592
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.700
who is a guy who studies this,

1593
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:53.120
he wrote a book called the happiness hypothesis talks exactly about this

1594
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:53.541
example.

1595
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:54.230
He said,

1596
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.070
if you masturbate it,

1597
00:43:55.071 --> 00:43:55.510
if you,

1598
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.290
if you took a dead chicken and you ate it very,

1599
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.133
it'd be fine.

1600
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.730
If you took the dead chicken fucked it,

1601
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:03.530
came in it and then ate it.

1602
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:04.340
People will be like,

1603
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.600
oh yeah,

1604
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.400
and he's another really difficult,

1605
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:08.061
if you didn't come,

1606
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:09.350
what if you like a tantric guy?

1607
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.711
A good,

1608
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:10.400
good question.

1609
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.170
You're likely question,

1610
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.020
put your penis and you're like,

1611
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:12.860
nope.

1612
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.140
That's how I fucked chickens.

1613
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:14.541
That's,

1614
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:14.960
I don't,

1615
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.180
I draw the line and actually coming in them,

1616
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.570
you could come on this.

1617
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.940
You just get that tight knit.

1618
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.560
That's the weakest muscle I have.

1619
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.480
Everything else is really strong that hold back calm muscles gotten better as

1620
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:30.080
I've,

1621
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.770
it's like an old lady's underarm,

1622
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.311
<v 2>you know,</v>

1623
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:33.144
old ladies,

1624
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.150
they're underneath your arm,

1625
00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:35.750
just fucking dangles this,

1626
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.500
there's no power to it.

1627
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.980
It's got no strength.

1628
00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:40.730
Old Ladies can't do dips.

1629
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.300
Put Out,

1630
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.000
come muscle,

1631
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.730
put like a weight belt on an old lady and Toda do dips.

1632
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.680
That's like how strong my come muscle breaks and just go home.

1633
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.210
It's basically curtains.

1634
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.920
Yeah.

1635
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.650
It doesn't have any power than hate.

1636
00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:56.380
Talks about talks about fucking like that.

1637
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:57.121
He used that example.

1638
00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:59.100
Then he used another example where he says,

1639
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:04.130
if a brother and sister in the woods use protection and have sex,

1640
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.870
it's the same idea.

1641
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:07.710
We immediately go,

1642
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:07.951
oh,

1643
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:08.700
that's wrong.

1644
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.210
Oh.

1645
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:09.810
But he says,

1646
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.350
okay,

1647
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.183
it's wrong.

1648
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.323
It is.

1649
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.100
That's taboo in most cultures.

1650
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:15.120
But again,

1651
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:16.020
and I haven't kids,

1652
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.270
they had sex and nobody's getting hurt.

1653
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.170
They're both,

1654
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:19.441
you know,

1655
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:20.670
they go on with their lives.

1656
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.420
What does that,

1657
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.090
why do we have this revolt and it where we have this Builtin,

1658
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.530
we as a society and as people universally have these very interesting through

1659
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:29.640
lines in culture,

1660
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.090
one being that all cultures recognize all cultures no matter primitive,

1661
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:35.310
recognize a humorous insults.

1662
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.240
Uh,

1663
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.210
every culture had no matter how primitive has a form of humorous in salts for

1664
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:39.541
each other.

1665
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:40.410
They make fun of each other.

1666
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.250
Uh,

1667
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.760
the other is that every culture,

1668
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.870
every according to Steven Pinker,

1669
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:47.010
every culture they've ever studied,

1670
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.551
100%.

1671
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:48.090
It has,

1672
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.070
has a place for humorous insult.

1673
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.971
So making fun,

1674
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:51.780
ribbing each other.

1675
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.570
Right?

1676
00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:52.731
Uh,

1677
00:45:52.731 --> 00:45:52.940
and,

1678
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.520
and you're talking about the most primitive tribes are the most aboriginal

1679
00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:57.840
tribes and the most,

1680
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.450
you know,

1681
00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:03.450
most technically technologically advanced tribes all have always had some form

1682
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:04.500
of humorous and salt.

1683
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:10.050
The other is a recognition for certain things that are taboo.

1684
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:10.943
Yes.

1685
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.110
But the different across the board culturally,

1686
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.580
like we were talking about those cultures in New Guinea and warriors in New

1687
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:20.560
Guinea that have this crazy thing where they molest young boy,

1688
00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:20.760
you know,

1689
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.460
strangling where they wear the were widows,

1690
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.520
a woman's husband dies the next man closest to the husband strangles her.

1691
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.210
Yeah.

1692
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.890
But those are very,

1693
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.040
very isolated tribes that have had not shared any ideas with other people that

1694
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:39.270
had no cross pollination.

1695
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.210
So you're going to get very weird fetishistic sort of,

1696
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.403
um,

1697
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.150
examples of human behavior.

1698
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:47.490
And that also like when you,

1699
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.030
we know that like when people molest children,

1700
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.870
that those children who have been molested often have this very distorted idea

1701
00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:58.740
of sexuality and sometimes become abusers themselves.

1702
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.690
And that this could have easily happened on the small island 100%.

1703
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.520
But these are large groups of people,

1704
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.630
like thousands of people practice these,

1705
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.090
these new Guinea semen warrior rituals.

1706
00:47:11.091 --> 00:47:13.020
It's still very small in relation.

1707
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.730
People need to read about this cause I mean,

1708
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.350
we're not going into depth about it.

1709
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:16.930
I mean,

1710
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.920
it's an incredible fucking bizarre thing.

1711
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:21.750
These new Guinea warriors,

1712
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.920
they take these young boys away from their mother at a very early age and they

1713
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:30.340
start having sex with them and they do it because they say that the boy semen in

1714
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:34.780
order to grow up strong and healthy by ingesting seaman either through their

1715
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:37.960
mouth or through their butt and like this is how they grow up.

1716
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.870
I mean this is the,

1717
00:47:38.871 --> 00:47:40.540
the semen warriors of New Guinea,

1718
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:42.220
Google it and freak the fuck out.

1719
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.050
Jared diamond did so many examples that has so many crazy examples of insane

1720
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:47.884
human behavior.

1721
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.560
It's usually probably some lone pervert who's like,

1722
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:51.520
let's fuck boys.

1723
00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:53.530
And now like he's the leader but,

1724
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:54.011
but you know,

1725
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:54.371
they've got,

1726
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.350
that's why they have cannibalism and all kinds of stuff.

1727
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:59.260
But whenever you see a large population,

1728
00:47:59.261 --> 00:48:03.780
a civilization of people who have been able to cross pollinate ideas.

1729
00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:05.290
So if you take huge areas,

1730
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.700
the bounty belt of Africa,

1731
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.820
the Fertile Crescent of the North Africa and the Middle East,

1732
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.740
China for example,

1733
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.630
that's where taboos have strong sexual undercurrents,

1734
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:20.230
where certain sexual activity and a lot of times has said is very taboo.

1735
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.900
And there's a lot of similarities you can draw with that.

1736
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.020
Um,

1737
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.000
which is interesting.

1738
00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:25.241
So,

1739
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:27.370
so there are through lines you can draw with cultures.

1740
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.290
You do get those aberrations with those smaller groups of people that just

1741
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.380
isolated people.

1742
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.060
Timing about the new Guinea people when we're on our trip about eating their

1743
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:38.440
dead bodies and the way they would,

1744
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.190
oh my plane is insane fucking thing that they should do.

1745
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.460
Yeah.

1746
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.540
Well I still do.

1747
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.580
I had Jared diamond on the podcast and I said,

1748
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.420
tell me about,

1749
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.400
you've seen them cannibalize and he said,

1750
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.360
you really want to know about it.

1751
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.661
And I said,

1752
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:49.811
yeah.

1753
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.081
I said,

1754
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:51.040
well you asked for it.

1755
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.670
And he said some tribes when they would have warring,

1756
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:56.290
they'd have a war and they killed somebody.

1757
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:56.801
They would eat,

1758
00:48:56.801 --> 00:48:58.150
they'd cook the pop up and chopping up,

1759
00:48:58.151 --> 00:48:58.420
Cook,

1760
00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.110
Cook the body.

1761
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:03.480
But there are tribes in Papa New Guinea that will take the body.

1762
00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.440
Like if a relative dies,

1763
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.090
they'll take the body,

1764
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.150
they'll lay it out naked on slats of wood.

1765
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.660
So there are slats and their holes and they put buckets under the slats and they

1766
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:18.520
let the body just purify and Gel to the point where it starts to drip into the

1767
00:49:18.521 --> 00:49:19.354
buckets.

1768
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:24.190
And then they take their sweet potatoes and they dip their sweet potatoes into

1769
00:49:24.191 --> 00:49:27.190
the human goo and they eat it.

1770
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.250
And,

1771
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.070
and Oh and here's the other problem.

1772
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:31.960
They are the reason a lot of,

1773
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:36.190
and they'd life expectancy for most of them in the highlands was like 40 years

1774
00:49:36.191 --> 00:49:37.010
old.

1775
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.330
Uh,

1776
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.920
most died by violent violent deaths from interwar and from infection and things.

1777
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:43.030
But they would also,

1778
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:43.721
when they would do that,

1779
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:44.580
they would get a,

1780
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.520
what they called laughing disease cocoon you,

1781
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.060
which is a crude spelled Jacob's crudes fell.

1782
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.600
What does that mad cow disease essentially from eating,

1783
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.111
you know,

1784
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:54.940
brain and you know all that tissue.

1785
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.320
So don't eat people.

1786
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:56.730
Guys.

1787
00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.160
Don't let the buy Gel and future via at least cook and eat a filet.

1788
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.040
If you're going to eat somebody eat the chest the ass.

1789
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.150
In Joe Rogan's case,

1790
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.910
he's got a set of cheeks on him and you've got some big legs.

1791
00:50:06.911 --> 00:50:07.631
I was looking at your legs.

1792
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:07.970
I think you're like,

1793
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.100
is it actually gotten bigger?

1794
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.241
You had your,

1795
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:13.900
you had your pants off for a second near the campfire ton and try your ass out.

1796
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.180
As we were talking goes literally doing squats,

1797
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.050
hanging his wet ass over the fire and I was like,

1798
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:21.010
I was like looking at your legs.

1799
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:21.340
I was like,

1800
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.061
the kids got some,

1801
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:22.720
he's got,

1802
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.950
he's got a strong lower body.

1803
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:25.360
It looks like a a Centaur.

1804
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.130
Well I told you I did prepare for this.

1805
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.610
Yeah,

1806
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:28.040
I'm pulling it

1807
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.501
<v 1>out for two.</v>

1808
00:50:28.501 --> 00:50:29.570
Why didn't you tell me to prepare?

1809
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.493
Because you wouldn't listen.

1810
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.340
I would listen.

1811
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.173
I work out.

1812
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.500
I've been lifting heavier out.

1813
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:35.421
Shut up.

1814
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.680
I do not look at my body.

1815
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.010
I was,

1816
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.470
I was doing a lot of a kettle bell squats,

1817
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.630
taking two seventies clean him,

1818
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.740
get him in here and just show that 25 okay.

1819
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:46.460
I could do that.

1820
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.220
That's a lot of ways you were making that noise.

1821
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:50.870
You gotta get a breathe out.

1822
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:51.770
You guys.

1823
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.820
I love when guys,

1824
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.920
I love them guys described their body bro.

1825
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:56.130
When I was living dude,

1826
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.350
my chest was like,

1827
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.520
am I as like Bro,

1828
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:02.120
my legs NASCAR like

1829
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.160
isn't it amazing what of calming and like like morale boosting thing.

1830
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:10.930
Having a fire was for us.

1831
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:11.923
God,

1832
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.120
we couldn't build a fire for the first what,

1833
00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:17.690
three days and when we finally got that fire going it was me and Mike.

1834
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.500
We led the charge.

1835
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:18.981
This idea,

1836
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:20.530
I was like we're going to make a fucking fire.

1837
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:21.470
Like we have gasoline,

1838
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:22.340
we have whiskey.

1839
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.980
Tell him how I tell them what the best kindling is in the world.

1840
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.790
Fritos.

1841
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:26.600
Fritos,

1842
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.350
Fritos.

1843
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:27.980
Fritos.

1844
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.650
Light on fire like a motherfucker and hold your flame.

1845
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.400
Hold their flank candles that you can't blow out on a birthday cake.

1846
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.200
While we were in town where we were in camp,

1847
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:37.160
I watched the documentary,

1848
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:37.910
King Corn.

1849
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.160
I had it on my laptop is one of the days where we couldn't go anywhere.

1850
00:51:40.161 --> 00:51:41.180
I just sat and watched this.

1851
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.990
I was worried that my laptop was going to cook and explode cause it was like in

1852
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:46.010
a sea of dew.

1853
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.760
But my laptop is tough cause it's been spilled on so many times.

1854
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:50.620
I spilled coffee on it.

1855
00:51:50.621 --> 00:51:51.810
It's tough and my laptop.

1856
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.510
But this fucking documentary is an amazing document.

1857
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.321
It King Corn,

1858
00:51:57.321 --> 00:51:58.310
if you've never seen it,

1859
00:51:58.311 --> 00:51:58.700
you,

1860
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.750
if you're interested at all and like what the fuck is going on with corn and how

1861
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:05.150
money things corn is in in our country.

1862
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:06.770
You got to watch his documentary.

1863
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:08.300
These guys did an amazing job.

1864
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:09.350
These two guys,

1865
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:10.550
they got out of college,

1866
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.610
they were doing some research on corn and they decided to uh,

1867
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.523
get their,

1868
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.300
their hair and their tissue,

1869
00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.630
uh,

1870
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:18.463
analyzed.

1871
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.390
And when they analyze it,

1872
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:21.260
this guy said,

1873
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.380
the carbon in your body is all from corn.

1874
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.380
We adjust somebody that you may,

1875
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.760
you eat so much corn that your body's made out of corn.

1876
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:29.031
It's like,

1877
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:30.110
what the fuck are you talking about?

1878
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.063
So these guys,

1879
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.160
they rented or leased a an acre of land on this guy's property in Iowa and they

1880
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:42.341
grew their own corn and grew it from the time it went to the ground to adding

1881
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:43.371
pesticides,

1882
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.510
to taking it to market.

1883
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:48.080
They went through the whole thing and then explained all the different things

1884
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:49.070
that corn is in.

1885
00:52:49.071 --> 00:52:51.020
And it is fucking stunning.

1886
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:51.591
It's in everything,

1887
00:52:51.591 --> 00:52:51.771
right?

1888
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:54.800
It's also stunning how all of it is with subsidies.

1889
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.510
And if it wasn't for government subsidies,

1890
00:52:56.511 --> 00:52:57.890
all these people would lose money.

1891
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.290
These guys got a check from the government to grow.

1892
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:03.560
Their acre of corn was small check because it was only one acre.

1893
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.740
But if they're growing 10,000,

1894
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.800
30,000 acres,

1895
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:07.880
like a lot of these folks are,

1896
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.240
they,

1897
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.850
they rely on these government cheque ethanol,

1898
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:11.361
ethanol,

1899
00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:12.650
which we don't really need any more.

1900
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:17.270
But ethanol is used and now there's a lobbying f there's a very strong lobbying

1901
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:20.270
presence in Washington that's not going to let ethanol go away.

1902
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.910
Athan all has a cottage industry around it.

1903
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:25.620
People make money off of growing corn for fuel.

1904
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.240
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1905
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:26.481
and,

1906
00:53:26.481 --> 00:53:27.960
and there are a thousand examples of that.

1907
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:28.351
You know,

1908
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:28.611
we're,

1909
00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:28.801
we're,

1910
00:53:28.801 --> 00:53:30.150
corn has a very strong lobby.

1911
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:32.160
The sugar lobby is very strong as another documentary called,

1912
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.930
fed up about,

1913
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.441
you know,

1914
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:34.830
when,

1915
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:35.460
when,

1916
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.650
when the World Health Organization came along and said,

1917
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:39.900
10 only 10% of your diet should be sugar.

1918
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.430
And a of all kinds,

1919
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:42.930
whether it's fruit juice or just sugar,

1920
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:44.730
it's just not good for your body.

1921
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:46.410
We have the science to prove it.

1922
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.770
And the the sugar industry and the corn syrup industry came along and said,

1923
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:54.691
well,

1924
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:55.351
if you want your,

1925
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:55.630
you know,

1926
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:59.370
put a lot of pressure on the Bush administration to tell them to World Health

1927
00:53:59.370 --> 00:53:59.371
Organization.

1928
00:53:59.371 --> 00:54:01.860
If you want your $450 million this year,

1929
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.210
you better at Revi.

1930
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.500
You better leave that out of your report because we have people believing in our

1931
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:12.000
school lunch programs and stuff to 25% of your diet can be simple sugars.

1932
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.130
And you know,

1933
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.370
I,

1934
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:18.070
I got to watch that documentary cause it's amazing how slow,

1935
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.610
how many interests,

1936
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:23.550
powerful interests get involved in getting you to eat corn,

1937
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.310
getting you to eat foods that in their byproducts that,

1938
00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.770
that they make a lot of money off that may not be so good for your body.

1939
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:29.401
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1940
00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:29.820
it's,

1941
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.840
it's bizarre.

1942
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:35.550
It's bizarre how bad it is for your body and how much of it is in foods,

1943
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.780
corn syrup,

1944
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:37.614
corn starch,

1945
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.640
corn proteins,

1946
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:38.941
corn,

1947
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:40.230
this corn that it's,

1948
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:41.070
it's incredible.

1949
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.090
These corn additives.

1950
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:45.090
And without the subsidies it wouldn't be happening.

1951
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.170
It's like our government is literally paying to keep our diets shitty.

1952
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:49.590
Yes sir.

1953
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:53.970
Because they're in bed with this industry and I'm really wondering what would

1954
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:58.971
happen if hemp became legal worldwide and especially legal in the United States

1955
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.790
because we sell hemp food.

1956
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.340
We sell those hemp protein bars that I brought with us on,

1957
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:06.174
on the trips,

1958
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:07.163
those on it,

1959
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:07.370
uh,

1960
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:10.500
hemp force protein bars and on at hemp force powder.

1961
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:13.890
But we have to buy our hemp from Canada and there's a bunch of different grades

1962
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:14.431
we buy.

1963
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:16.680
The highest grade stuff is very expensive.

1964
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.300
And one of the reason why it's very expensive,

1965
00:55:18.301 --> 00:55:21.210
it's hard to grow and it's growing up in Canada.

1966
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:21.301
Well,

1967
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:22.650
it's hard to grow in America.

1968
00:55:22.651 --> 00:55:23.520
It's impossible to grow.

1969
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:25.500
I should have said it's nice not subsidized either.

1970
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:25.770
No,

1971
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:26.461
it's not substance.

1972
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:27.690
You have to get it in Canada and the,

1973
00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.050
the,

1974
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:28.883
the hearts,

1975
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.700
the hemp hearts that the best part of it is what we get.

1976
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:33.210
And it's,

1977
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:33.660
you know,

1978
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.950
it's very high in protein,

1979
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.210
but we get that could be all over this country and far and it's easy to fucking

1980
00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:39.920
grow it.

1981
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.550
It's not susceptible to various bugs and and and bullshit and weeds.

1982
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.660
It is a fucking weed.

1983
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:46.890
It grows crazy easy.

1984
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.420
Is hemp is hemp a it's in the marijuana family,

1985
00:55:51.421 --> 00:55:51.960
right?

1986
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.771
This is what it is.

1987
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:54.960
It's the male version of the plant.

1988
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.940
The female version of the plant,

1989
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.540
yes.

1990
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:02.540
Is where you get the THC but they can grow like acres and acres of non

1991
00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:04.470
psychoactive hemp,

1992
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.910
like you don't even get,

1993
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:06.540
you know what I mean?

1994
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.370
Test positive for THC.

1995
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.080
If you eat hemp protein,

1996
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.270
but if you eat poppy seed bagels,

1997
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.830
you test positive for heroin.

1998
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.680
Wow.

1999
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.440
People that are going through drug tests,

2000
00:56:16.441 --> 00:56:18.480
like if you don't touch poppy seeds,

2001
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:19.140
we can't.

2002
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.270
They tell you don't need poppy seeds for x amount of days,

2003
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:22.470
dam because if you eat it,

2004
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:24.160
you'll you turn up positive for heroin.

2005
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.690
Yeah.

2006
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:26.290
It's fucking crazy.

2007
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:26.860
It's crazy.

2008
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.760
It's really crazy.

2009
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.040
And hemp is,

2010
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.080
it has all the essential amino acids.

2011
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.360
It's a far better source of paper.

2012
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.231
It's far better.

2013
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:36.280
Building material.

2014
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.650
If you ever seen a hemp stalk your pickup,

2015
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:39.431
like a hemp stalk,

2016
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:40.690
like hemp stalk.

2017
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:41.350
Okay.

2018
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.161
You can make rope out of it.

2019
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:42.741
I know that will,

2020
00:56:42.741 --> 00:56:43.060
yeah.

2021
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.410
Will you make the best rope?

2022
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.771
Okay.

2023
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:46.720
The best robe in the world parachutes.

2024
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.800
George senior,

2025
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:48.970
George Herbert Walker Bush,

2026
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.660
the parachute that he use to safely parachute in World War II.

2027
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.200
That was made out of hemp that he parachuted to safety with a fucking hemp

2028
00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:56.651
parachute.

2029
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:56.890
Wow.

2030
00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.490
There was a video called hemp for victory were in World War II.

2031
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:01.150
They were incurred.

2032
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.030
This is post illegalization by the way,

2033
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.160
they made it illegal in the 1930s,

2034
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:06.330
well,

2035
00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:07.163
the 1940s,

2036
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.300
they were encouraging farmers to grow hemp for the war effort.

2037
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.100
Like go pull up heavily then pull up the youtube,

2038
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.150
the youtube video hemp for victory.

2039
00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:17.200
It was part of it.

2040
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:21.680
Dupont was in cahoots allegedly with William Randolph Hearst,

2041
00:57:21.681 --> 00:57:25.330
but William Randolph Hearst was the main reason why hamp became illegal and a

2042
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:30.050
lot of it was because he was going to have to convert all of his paper mills to,

2043
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.280
uh,

2044
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.113
to hemp paper.

2045
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.800
Hemp paper is way better.

2046
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.070
Like if you pick up regular paper looking into this hemp for victory,

2047
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:36.570
play this,

2048
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:36.941
I'll play it.

2049
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:37.840
Play the volume.

2050
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:39.160
This was,

2051
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.480
this is a propaganda film that they made in the 1940s to get people to start

2052
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.070
growing hemp for the war effort.

2053
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:46.060
Wow.

2054
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.331
Yeah.

2055
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:47.350
This is fucking crazy.

2056
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:48.131
When you think about it.

2057
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.480
This shit is illegal today.

2058
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.663
That's amazing.

2059
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.370
Look at the,

2060
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:53.680
and those buildings are made of hemp,

2061
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:54.330
you guys,

2062
00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.130
<v 4>Rican temples,</v>

2063
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.770
when you was already old and the service of mankind

2064
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:01.470
for thousands of years.

2065
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.190
Even then this plant had been grown for code engine,

2066
00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:10.191
coarse cloth and China and elsewhere in the east for centuries prior to about 18

2067
00:58:12.391 --> 00:58:13.224
fifth day,

2068
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:18.230
all the ships that sail the western is my rig with hempen rope and sales for the

2069
00:58:18.691 --> 00:58:20.280
sailor and no less than the hangman.

2070
00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.110
Him was indispensable.

2071
00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:22.611
<v 3>Do you know?</v>

2072
00:58:22.611 --> 00:58:26.990
Canvas comes from the word cannabis canvas cloth,

2073
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:28.130
like canvas sales.

2074
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.480
Those were all made out of hemp.

2075
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:31.160
I just loved their voices.

2076
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.760
They where they talked about things were very formal.

2077
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.860
That was their version of the Strip club Dj.

2078
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:37.311
That's right.

2079
00:58:37.311 --> 00:58:40.520
Hemp was something that always the music behind with some flute.

2080
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:41.090
Look at that.

2081
00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:41.860
Those are hemp courts.

2082
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.340
He's good American and by Hamp,

2083
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:45.950
even people in the east,

2084
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.720
China and other way other places.

2085
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:51.590
So what happened was in the 1930s they came out with this invention called a

2086
00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:53.930
decorticator and the decorticator,

2087
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:57.290
they used it to more effectively processed the hemp fiber would they?

2088
00:58:57.291 --> 00:58:58.490
Before they used slavery,

2089
00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.080
slavery was the only word.

2090
00:59:00.081 --> 00:59:04.040
The way they would do it smashed these fibers down and it wasn't as effective as

2091
00:59:04.041 --> 00:59:04.874
cotton.

2092
00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.280
And so they came up with a cotton mill.

2093
00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.820
When a Eli Whitney came up with the cotton will mill cotton gin.

2094
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:12.380
When they started doing that,

2095
00:59:12.381 --> 00:59:13.910
like well cotton's way easier now.

2096
00:59:13.911 --> 00:59:15.380
So they started making things out of cotton,

2097
00:59:15.381 --> 00:59:17.120
but then they came out with the decorticate in like,

2098
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.983
oh shit,

2099
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:20.120
hemp is going to be making a comeback.

2100
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.370
And they were hemp is a new billion dollar

2101
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.671
<v 2>crop.</v>

2102
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:23.690
Like pull up the Po,

2103
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:28.720
the cover of Popular Science magazine and a 1930 I want to say 35 37 when I was

2104
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:36.050
on the cover of popular science magazine,

2105
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:36.800
said hemp,

2106
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.600
the new billion dollar crop.

2107
00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:40.460
This is the cover of this magazine.

2108
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:40.760
And,

2109
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.530
and then right after that it was made illegal.

2110
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.820
And then dupont and those that aren't just came along just pull up hemp,

2111
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.630
the new billion dollar Kraeutler that fucking magazine.

2112
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.590
Wow.

2113
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:52.640
1938 there it is.

2114
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:53.474
Wow.

2115
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:53.930
Hemp.

2116
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:58.190
I always going to buy him clothes and hemp paper and hemp this and hemp food and

2117
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:58.910
hemp oils.

2118
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.510
Hemp oils are super good for your body and not psychoactive at all.

2119
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:03.141
When you,

2120
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:04.210
when you said Eli Whitney,

2121
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.031
it was the same kind of thing.

2122
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:10.031
I was thinking about how one man's invention made slavery essentially it was a

2123
01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:12.340
real abolition movement.

2124
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.060
The abolitionist movement going on,

2125
01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.280
we're slavery was really,

2126
01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:19.880
the antislavery movement was gaining tremendous ground cause it was really hard

2127
01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:20.810
to justify of course.

2128
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:25.670
And then when Eli Whitney came along with the cotton gin and all the southern

2129
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:26.690
plantations were like,

2130
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:28.700
we got all this free labor and,

2131
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.170
and this is white gold.

2132
01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:32.300
We're selling the stuff not only to Europe,

2133
01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.920
to North Africa,

2134
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:34.491
everywhere.

2135
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:35.840
Everybody wants American cotton.

2136
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.501
Ah,

2137
01:00:36.501 --> 01:00:37.400
not so fast.

2138
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.540
We're not getting rid of slavery here.

2139
01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:39.450
This makes no sense.

2140
01:00:39.451 --> 01:00:41.690
So we got a lot of free labor and uh,

2141
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.920
thank you Eli Whitney for,

2142
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.461
you know,

2143
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:43.881
I wonder,

2144
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:44.451
I always wonder,

2145
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:46.430
like you come up with this amazing invention and uh,

2146
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.520
but that's going to keep up people and slave for about another hundred years.

2147
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.390
Thank you very much.

2148
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.730
It's just the one of those weird things in history where you just go,

2149
01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:53.260
fuck.

2150
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:53.460
Well,

2151
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.430
it played a part obviously.

2152
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:56.663
Um,

2153
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.740
have you ever heard about this incredible historical story about Morse Morse

2154
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:01.730
code was invented?

2155
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.593
No,

2156
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.830
this is so amazing.

2157
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.980
Was Amazing Shit.

2158
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:08.501
But the,

2159
01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.680
this is what's more amazing.

2160
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:12.980
Morse was a paint or a very successful oil painter,

2161
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:13.970
very successful.

2162
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.890
And his wife,

2163
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:20.810
he got to tell him he got up before Morse code this.

2164
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.870
It's very important to remember that the only way to get a message to somebody

2165
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.280
throughout history,

2166
01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:29.090
w Alexander the Great and George Washington had to use the exact same

2167
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:30.050
methodology,

2168
01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:30.950
which was horse,

2169
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:34.240
boat or foot as I messenger pigeon pigeon,

2170
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.300
but in very small areas.

2171
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.530
What about crow?

2172
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:36.951
Uh,

2173
01:01:36.951 --> 01:01:37.221
no,

2174
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:38.590
I'm French and Raven.

2175
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:39.171
I'm afraid.

2176
01:01:39.171 --> 01:01:39.831
And I was a raven.

2177
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:40.940
That's in game of Thrones.

2178
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.890
That's a lie.

2179
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:43.723
It's a lie,

2180
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.011
but no,

2181
01:01:44.011 --> 01:01:44.121
no,

2182
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:44.331
no.

2183
01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:45.170
They send a raven.

2184
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.160
I'm sorry my friend.

2185
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:46.661
That's a lie.

2186
01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.220
It's go to be in school to be a,

2187
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.780
a messenger between anything.

2188
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.170
You'll tell me the dragons aren't real.

2189
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.861
Uh,

2190
01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:52.251
well,

2191
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.260
have you ever seen a dragon?

2192
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.390
The Crocodile?

2193
01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:56.840
Yes,

2194
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.673
but crocodiles.

2195
01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:58.430
That's true.

2196
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:59.031
That's what happened.

2197
01:01:59.031 --> 01:02:00.470
Don't give it away as the mother of dragons.

2198
01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.281
That's an amazing,

2199
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:01.731
I love that.

2200
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:02.870
I can't wait till that goes back.

2201
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.333
She's wonderful.

2202
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.390
She's the mother of dragons cause he's a good kid because he see,

2203
01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:08.751
hey,

2204
01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:09.351
she's a queen,

2205
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:09.590
Bro.

2206
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.190
Whatever.

2207
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.371
Hey,

2208
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:11.870
don't always is getting all grab.

2209
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:12.320
That's it.

2210
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.480
That's my friend Jimmy from back home.

2211
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.410
Jimmy to [inaudible] used to say that whenever a girl was like really perverted.

2212
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.253
So New York,

2213
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.230
Boston,

2214
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.561
he would go,

2215
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:20.490
what a good kid.

2216
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:20.990
Good kid.

2217
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.960
She's a good kid.

2218
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.333
She can park.

2219
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.540
Does that cheapen Berkey?

2220
01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.610
Started saying that she's a good kid.

2221
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.420
He's his head too.

2222
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:27.700
Well,

2223
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:27.930
yeah,

2224
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:28.650
it's very New York.

2225
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:28.711
Oh,

2226
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:29.820
so it's an east coast guy.

2227
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.930
So for perverts.

2228
01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:31.210
Yeah.

2229
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.280
Well I don't think,

2230
01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:32.550
uh,

2231
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:33.240
you know,

2232
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.530
a friend Jimmy was all Boston kid.

2233
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.140
You list,

2234
01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.620
you say it's grant was the one who turned yellow stone into a national park.

2235
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:41.240
Um,

2236
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.240
Theodore Roosevelt turned Yosemite so more to Dj Jackpot.

2237
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:51.900
Dj Morse Morse gets a message.

2238
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.430
Your wife is sick in Connecticut.

2239
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.170
He lives in the north,

2240
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.340
northern New York or something.

2241
01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.630
He gets on a horse and buggy and he goes down and by the time he gets there,

2242
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:01.464
he loved his wife.

2243
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:02.400
She wasn't only dead,

2244
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:03.211
she had been buried.

2245
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:04.380
So we never got a chance to say bye to her.

2246
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:05.550
He's heartbroken.

2247
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.510
And all he does as this painter,

2248
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:08.100
a painter,

2249
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.490
is he obsesses over how in the world he can figure out,

2250
01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:13.680
he could figure out a way to not have that,

2251
01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:14.190
where you could get,

2252
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.810
if he had gotten the message earlier,

2253
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:17.190
he could have gotten there to see his wife.

2254
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.480
Seven years later he's on an ocean liner and he meets a dude who's a scientist,

2255
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:26.310
is working with electromagnetic fields and he basically says,

2256
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:31.370
do you think it would be possible to use this electromagnetic field and get it

2257
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.010
somewhere else so that we can quick and time.

2258
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.330
Long story short,

2259
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:36.930
he could,

2260
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:37.180
he,

2261
01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.570
he,

2262
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:39.360
he basically gets together with this,

2263
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.140
this guy who is a scientist and electromatic name fields.

2264
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.120
They send a message,

2265
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:48.020
and I can't remember whether it was from New York to Washington DC,

2266
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:49.590
but I think it was a,

2267
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.270
but at first it was a short distance.

2268
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:51.961
It was only like,

2269
01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:52.680
you know,

2270
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.210
uh,

2271
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.520
you know,

2272
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:53.970
I don't know,

2273
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:55.050
a quarter mile or something.

2274
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.381
I don't know.

2275
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:57.360
What are you looking it up right now in the Baltimore,

2276
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.410
Washington and Baltimore.

2277
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:04.070
And they sent a message in as much time as it takes electricity to get there.

2278
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.750
It was instantaneous and it,

2279
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:07.290
it,

2280
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.580
it was of course,

2281
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.650
a bigger revolution than even the Internet.

2282
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:15.651
Some would argue because before that time and throughout all of human history,

2283
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:20.790
the only way to get a message to somebody was by foot,

2284
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.860
boat or horse,

2285
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.980
and it just had never been done before.

2286
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.280
It was a complete revolution and it started because the guy was heartbroken over

2287
01:04:29.281 --> 01:04:31.530
not being able to say goodbye to his wife before she died.

2288
01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.473
That's incredible.

2289
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.470
That is fucking incredible.

2290
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:35.460
That's Morse code.

2291
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.360
That's why I love history.

2292
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.291
Well,

2293
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:37.891
it's fascinating.

2294
01:04:37.891 --> 01:04:42.891
We think that there was people a long time ago that if something was going on 10

2295
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:43.854
miles away,

2296
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.030
there's no way of finding out.

2297
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.200
I know.

2298
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:46.740
No Way.

2299
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.820
I know now.

2300
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.380
If so,

2301
01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.790
there's a revolution going on in China right now in Hong Kong.

2302
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.710
We were watching it live and real time,

2303
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.360
there's streaming websites,

2304
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:55.021
you know,

2305
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:55.261
there's,

2306
01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:59.760
there's criticism of the way China's handling and you get to read various

2307
01:04:59.761 --> 01:05:01.110
different points of view.

2308
01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:02.460
I mean it's an oppressive,

2309
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:04.740
oppressive regimes aren't allowed to get away with murder.

2310
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:05.521
They can,

2311
01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:07.940
but they have to be very careful because they know the world's watching it.

2312
01:05:07.941 --> 01:05:09.090
It makes the world less brutal.

2313
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:09.690
I would argue.

2314
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.740
Oh way more.

2315
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.430
Way,

2316
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.870
way more accountable.

2317
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.110
[inaudible] would have done if the Mongols were coming into the Middle East and

2318
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:17.980
just killing people wholesale on Russia

2319
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.610
<v 1>the way they did.</v>

2320
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.050
Think about what the world we'd be doing.

2321
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:20.830
We'd be like,

2322
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:23.650
well we've got to stop these assholes on horseback right now.

2323
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.940
You know,

2324
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.810
but nobody was watching.

2325
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.320
We didn't know.

2326
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.200
That's where you got to love something called Merck.

2327
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.010
Okay.

2328
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.840
Cause we just send some drones over there.

2329
01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:37.050
Oh you got 160 pound bow and you like to drink horseman blood mixed with

2330
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.280
Marriage Mountain Nevada sipping coffee,

2331
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:40.541
Xbox,

2332
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:44.930
drinking mountain dew and a fucking kid with a hemorrhoid is lightened.

2333
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.270
You bitches up from the sky.

2334
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.550
Big Thumb muscles.

2335
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.830
Could you imagine if you could do that?

2336
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.920
I mean if time travel becomes reality where you can't mess up the timeline like

2337
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:57.040
safe,

2338
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.510
all timelines are completely independent and say if you could go back in time

2339
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.010
and you could have like have at it and do whatever the fuck you want,

2340
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:08.950
who would have no bearing on the future if they find out the timelines are

2341
01:06:08.951 --> 01:06:12.100
completely independent and that if you do go back in time and has literally no

2342
01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:13.450
effect on the current future,

2343
01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.940
you go back to where you were and nothing's changed you even your,

2344
01:06:16.941 --> 01:06:18.820
your actual actions never really took place.

2345
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.320
They took place in an alternative timeline,

2346
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.770
how much would you love to fucking suit up with some like navy seal type

2347
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:27.550
bulletproof armor?

2348
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.700
Lock yourself down in a fucking giant tank and go roll into the Mongol Empire.

2349
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:33.791
One person.

2350
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:34.624
So you know what?

2351
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.793
I win fit.

2352
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.880
I'm just taking over.

2353
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:40.630
I think about that every single day and I'm not kidding.

2354
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.710
I think about a helicopter gunship while these a holes on their horses coming in

2355
01:06:44.711 --> 01:06:46.690
and try to kill and rape and do all that and be like,

2356
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:46.871
Hey,

2357
01:06:46.871 --> 01:06:47.400
guess what?

2358
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.880
Check out this birth from the sky.

2359
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:50.120
I looked like a giant horn.

2360
01:06:50.121 --> 01:06:51.400
It tell me if this stinks.

2361
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:51.840
Kick,

2362
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:51.991
kick,

2363
01:06:51.991 --> 01:06:52.201
kick,

2364
01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:52.381
kick,

2365
01:06:52.381 --> 01:06:52.540
kick,

2366
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:52.731
kick,

2367
01:06:52.731 --> 01:06:52.871
kick.

2368
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:54.010
Now think about this.

2369
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:58.330
What will people from a thousand years from now be thinking about us and how

2370
01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:01.390
ridiculous where they think that we are listening with these assholes did.

2371
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:06.630
They made explosions in little metal containers and these explosions propelled

2372
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:12.280
these very dense metal balls through the air.

2373
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.100
I ridiculous speeds and they went through each other's bodies and that's how

2374
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:15.820
they did war.

2375
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.140
They couldn't read minds.

2376
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.150
They didn't understand it's enlightenment and they were also human,

2377
01:07:20.151 --> 01:07:22.480
didn't have pills yet.

2378
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:24.970
They didn't know how to have perfect genetics.

2379
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.040
They didn't know how to engineer cancer away.

2380
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.960
They were all fighting over resources.

2381
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.860
They got called.

2382
01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:32.710
They had electricity that was coming from wait for it.

2383
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.820
Nuclear Power,

2384
01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:34.840
these fucking idiots.

2385
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.060
They had developed these nuclear sites where they had these generators that they

2386
01:07:40.061 --> 01:07:43.810
could never shut off and they kept them running and when they would have

2387
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:45.580
anything would go wrong and the power would go out.

2388
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.850
It would melt down and they would have to clear everyone out of the area for

2389
01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:51.790
$100,000 that you had to be tied to a power source.

2390
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:56.791
You literally had to have a long rope coming out of your head that was attached

2391
01:07:56.921 --> 01:08:00.310
to some huge box just to hear yourself or other people.

2392
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.930
Everything was plugged in.

2393
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:02.201
Well,

2394
01:08:02.201 --> 01:08:04.240
how about solar power in California?

2395
01:08:04.241 --> 01:08:06.010
Why isn't everything solar powered?

2396
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:06.670
I don't know.

2397
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.170
We don't have any fucking rain.

2398
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:08.681
I mean,

2399
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:08.831
he's,

2400
01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:13.810
the one resource that we have that's bountiful and plentiful is sunlight.

2401
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.160
We have a real problem.

2402
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:15.620
We've,

2403
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.720
it's rained once in a year here.

2404
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.260
It's crazy.

2405
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.280
We have a real problem,

2406
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.770
but we have massive,

2407
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.650
massive amounts of solar electricity that no one's tapping into and we've got to

2408
01:08:26.651 --> 01:08:28.850
fucking ocean that we could just desalinate.

2409
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.020
Why don't,

2410
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.520
why haven't they figured out how to do that and say,

2411
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:31.701
well,

2412
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:32.930
it takes an incredible amount of power.

2413
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.640
What did I fucking solar power.

2414
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.380
How about use solar power?

2415
01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.460
Figure out an efficient way of using solar power to process the salt out of the

2416
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:41.120
water.

2417
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.160
And we have the most green,

2418
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:44.810
lush landscape ever.

2419
01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.793
I California,

2420
01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:47.960
we have the technology yet.

2421
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:51.240
I think that's really hard to do that get tow work on it.

2422
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.000
A guy named Morris figured out a way to send signals back with no Internet on

2423
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.780
inventors.

2424
01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.190
Note with even have cars.

2425
01:08:58.191 --> 01:08:58.580
No,

2426
01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.230
no cars.

2427
01:08:59.230 --> 01:08:59.610
No,

2428
01:08:59.610 --> 01:08:59.950
no.

2429
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:00.783
Do they have phones?

2430
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.661
They had trains.

2431
01:09:02.661 --> 01:09:02.781
They,

2432
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:06.840
I think they had the internal [inaudible] worked on coal.

2433
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.050
If you had a book and you spit on the pages,

2434
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:11.540
all the fucking information would run down and leak.

2435
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:12.530
Uh,

2436
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.160
think about it.

2437
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:13.430
I,

2438
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:14.810
we're full of books.

2439
01:09:14.811 --> 01:09:17.450
Had to be a hand handwoven and,

2440
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.490
but the printing press was another revolution.

2441
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:23.330
I mean Gutenberg's but he was a watchmaker and it was just the printing press

2442
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:24.164
was another,

2443
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.720
when you talk about the seminar people in history,

2444
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:28.220
that people that changed everything.

2445
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:28.910
He's in there.

2446
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:30.710
When was the printing press invented?

2447
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.150
I used to know the answer to this,

2448
01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:32.740
uh,

2449
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.471
in the,

2450
01:09:33.471 --> 01:09:37.970
it might've been actually in the beginning of the 18 hundreds or maybe even

2451
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.170
earlier than that.

2452
01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.760
Let me like,

2453
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:44.780
I think 17 it was like the 17 the actual printing press was probably invented,

2454
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:48.210
I believe in 17 why?

2455
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.240
Why ask why Jamie?

2456
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.040
I'm just trying to guess because I can't remember.

2457
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:54.530
I guess if by the time it actually took hold,

2458
01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:55.310
it was a while.

2459
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:56.180
It was about a hundred years.

2460
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.640
It's amazing to think that back before then,

2461
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:01.040
like people had to write out all the letters.

2462
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.731
Yeah,

2463
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:04.730
I think it's 1600 1640 if you get like an old book,

2464
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.620
it was earlier in 1640 well,

2465
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:07.520
Martin Luther,

2466
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.061
what didn't,

2467
01:10:08.061 --> 01:10:10.880
wasn't that one of the reasons why Martin Luther was able to spread his

2468
01:10:10.881 --> 01:10:15.110
propaganda so fast because he was printing things and putting them on the walls

2469
01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:15.740
of church.

2470
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.020
He didn't know he,

2471
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.450
he,

2472
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.440
he did his,

2473
01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.120
I think it was bitten Berg.

2474
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:21.021
He did.

2475
01:10:21.021 --> 01:10:22.460
He did his hundred proclamations,

2476
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:23.990
any nail it to the church door.

2477
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:27.920
And that was basically saying that the Catholic church was a sham,

2478
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.280
or at least they didn't need all this money and it was corrupt.

2479
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.510
And if you want the word of God,

2480
01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:33.440
all you need is the Bible.

2481
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:35.210
You don't need all this elaborate.

2482
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:37.460
It was actually more than that.

2483
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.350
He actually phonetically translated the Bible for the first time for the common

2484
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:43.184
folk.

2485
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.050
Regular people could read the Bible.

2486
01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:46.570
I that wasn't actually Martin Luther's,

2487
01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.590
that wasn't Martin Luther's contribution.

2488
01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:52.010
Martin Luther's contribution was to say he was a Jesuit priest,

2489
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.521
I believe,

2490
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:54.980
who said that it to be,

2491
01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:55.640
um,

2492
01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.590
you can be just as holy as the pope,

2493
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.210
as a common man.

2494
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.610
If you are religious and you follow the Bible,

2495
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:05.810
you don't need this huge infrastructure on hierarchy of bishops and priests.

2496
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.480
He did something with translating the Bible.

2497
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:09.500
I know this for sure.

2498
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.140
What was,

2499
01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:10.830
um,

2500
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:11.241
what does it,

2501
01:11:11.241 --> 01:11:12.074
what year was it?

2502
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.350
Wow.

2503
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.680
50.

2504
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.513
That's incredible.

2505
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.250
<v 3>But it didn't really take hold.</v>

2506
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.610
The printing press wasn't used,

2507
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:18.000
uh,

2508
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.331
you know,

2509
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:19.890
until a hundred,

2510
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:20.671
200 years later.

2511
01:11:20.671 --> 01:11:21.080
I mean,

2512
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.260
I was on a wide scale.

2513
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.933
The projects,

2514
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:24.391
yeah,

2515
01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:25.950
Mar the Luther Bible,

2516
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:30.390
it German language Bible translation from the Hebrew and ancient Greek by Martin

2517
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.870
Luther.

2518
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:31.260
Yeah,

2519
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.460
it was a,

2520
01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:36.900
so the new testament was first published in 1522 and the complete Bible

2521
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:39.360
containing the old and new testaments,

2522
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:39.960
uh,

2523
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.760
was 1534 and the project absorbed Luther's later years,

2524
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.850
thanks to then recently invented printing press.

2525
01:11:47.851 --> 01:11:50.850
The result was a widely disseminated and,

2526
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:51.330
uh,

2527
01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:55.500
contributed significantly to development of today's modern high German language.

2528
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.840
And so what had happened was when Luther,

2529
01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:58.890
this is all from,

2530
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.121
there's a,

2531
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:00.780
um,

2532
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:05.100
the reason why I know it is because of a Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast

2533
01:12:05.101 --> 01:12:05.750
of on it.

2534
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:06.060
Um,

2535
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.870
I don't remember the exact episode.

2536
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.120
I'll,

2537
01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.150
I'll try to recall it,

2538
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:14.390
but it's amazing this episode on Martin Luther and how the Luther had created

2539
01:12:16.921 --> 01:12:21.921
this movement and this movement had actually gone far and beyond his ideas and

2540
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.670
gotten right completely,

2541
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:24.520
totally radical,

2542
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:29.910
which was essentially the proletariat can be just as holy as somebody with cloth

2543
01:12:30.061 --> 01:12:31.050
and a crown.

2544
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:31.291
I mean,

2545
01:12:31.291 --> 01:12:31.681
in other words,

2546
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:32.030
you,

2547
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.380
you was,

2548
01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.213
it was kind of a,

2549
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.640
it was kind of the democratization of Christianity,

2550
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:35.941
right?

2551
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:36.400
I mean,

2552
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.840
all you need was a bible and to walk and to live the word of God and you could

2553
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:40.220
be,

2554
01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.990
you need a church in order to,

2555
01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:43.531
that was,

2556
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:44.940
that was real heresy to say that,

2557
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:45.181
you know,

2558
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.200
you as a farmer,

2559
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:47.640
if you follow the word of God,

2560
01:12:47.641 --> 01:12:49.410
can be even less corrupt,

2561
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.900
envy in more favor with God than even the pope.

2562
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.650
That was,

2563
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:53.970
that was pretty radical.

2564
01:12:53.971 --> 01:12:54.151
I mean,

2565
01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:54.690
he,

2566
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:56.100
I think he had to leave Germany for it.

2567
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.731
Well,

2568
01:12:56.731 --> 01:12:57.160
I don't,

2569
01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.000
I don't remember exactly specifically what the events were,

2570
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.660
but his,

2571
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.920
his take on it,

2572
01:13:01.921 --> 01:13:03.150
Dan Carlin's take on it.

2573
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.500
I think your God damn it,

2574
01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:05.311
I'm going to find it here,

2575
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.450
but just didn't,

2576
01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:08.610
didn't his teaching sparked a hundred years war.

2577
01:13:08.611 --> 01:13:08.881
I mean,

2578
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:11.010
the Catholics and the process is vicious wars.

2579
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:13.320
Thor's angels is the name of the podcast.

2580
01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:14.220
Um,

2581
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.910
you gotta you gotta listen to it because it is fucking absolutely,

2582
01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:19.050
completely stunning.

2583
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:19.800
It,

2584
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.633
uh,

2585
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.220
he's a,

2586
01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.650
he's a fucking amazing guy,

2587
01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:23.071
man.

2588
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:23.904
Dan Carlin,

2589
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:25.590
his podcasts are amazing.

2590
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:26.491
And his,

2591
01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:26.820
uh,

2592
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.653
his,

2593
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.910
his take on it is so,

2594
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.000
it's so enthralling.

2595
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:36.960
He's so good at like being theatrical and dragging you into an explaining it,

2596
01:13:36.961 --> 01:13:37.590
all that.

2597
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:42.590
But he explains all the personalities that were involved and all the conflicts

2598
01:13:42.601 --> 01:13:42.991
that were involved.

2599
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:47.400
But it was essentially the first time where the public had gotten a hold of what

2600
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:50.310
it really said in the Bible because before you couldn't read the Bible,

2601
01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.270
you had to,

2602
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.421
yeah,

2603
01:13:51.421 --> 01:13:52.254
it was ready to eat.

2604
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.040
So they had to rely on other people and it was red a lot of times in Latin and,

2605
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.930
and a lot of people didn't speak Latin.

2606
01:13:57.931 --> 01:13:59.700
They would just go to church and listen to the,

2607
01:13:59.720 --> 01:13:59.980
you know,

2608
01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:03.140
listen to the priest speaks to this day is all summer long island.

2609
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.740
You go to the pub,

2610
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.840
you go to church resell,

2611
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.110
so we'll give you,

2612
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.660
you would do things for the priest and they would,

2613
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:10.590
they would grant you,

2614
01:14:10.591 --> 01:14:10.990
um,

2615
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.530
one of the war,

2616
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.460
what Kimber the word for it,

2617
01:14:12.461 --> 01:14:15.970
but you'd basically get points in favor of going to heaven.

2618
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:16.421
Let's go.

2619
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:16.921
It became very,

2620
01:14:16.921 --> 01:14:17.280
very like,

2621
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:17.650
you know,

2622
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:18.970
you still liquid one was hand written.

2623
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:19.804
Amazing.

2624
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.141
Oh,

2625
01:14:20.141 --> 01:14:20.591
how about that?

2626
01:14:20.591 --> 01:14:22.720
What Steven Elvis sang about all the buffalo?

2627
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:23.471
Yeah.

2628
01:14:23.471 --> 01:14:25.210
Well Dan Flores,

2629
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.110
um,

2630
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:29.470
buffalo diplomacy and bison diplomacy.

2631
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:30.230
He's uh,

2632
01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:30.610
the Chi.

2633
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:31.990
I'm going to try to get him on the podcast.

2634
01:14:31.991 --> 01:14:34.240
I'm getting his information from a vanilla,

2635
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:39.420
but what essentially is saying is that our idea is that the white man came and

2636
01:14:39.761 --> 01:14:41.290
killed all the buffalo.

2637
01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:43.270
There were millions of Buffalo.

2638
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.160
And then also the,

2639
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:50.190
there's a commonly held misconception that people gave smallpox to the native

2640
01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.253
Americans on purpose.

2641
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.560
And that would really happened was smallpox.

2642
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:58.750
They didn't even know what the fuck smallpox was.

2643
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:03.010
And the French had given it to the native Americans accidentally because they

2644
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:03.610
had it,

2645
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:05.240
it spread through the native American,

2646
01:15:05.241 --> 01:15:05.981
the Spanish too,

2647
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.311
I think.

2648
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:06.700
Yes.

2649
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.130
And killed a huge amount of people.

2650
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.510
They say 90% of the population,

2651
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:11.441
90% of the people.

2652
01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:13.120
So when that happened,

2653
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:16.930
the buffalo just grew out of control.

2654
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:19.690
And what he talked about is how the early settlers,

2655
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.830
the early Europeans,

2656
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.440
they documented all these different things that they seen.

2657
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:25.180
They had seen all deer,

2658
01:15:25.181 --> 01:15:25.511
elk,

2659
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:26.171
all the different animals.

2660
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:26.560
Let's see,

2661
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.700
they didn't talk about Buffalo.

2662
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.331
They did.

2663
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:29.260
They didn't document it.

2664
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:33.440
But then hundreds of years later after the native American population has

2665
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.210
dwindled,

2666
01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:35.350
substantially,

2667
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.870
90% of them have died off because of smallpox.

2668
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:40.150
The buffalo were out of fucking control.

2669
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.190
And he also talked about how the introduction of the horse changed the way they

2670
01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:47.030
were hunting because the horse,

2671
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:50.680
the horse even proceeded a lot of European settlers,

2672
01:15:50.681 --> 01:15:51.514
Spanish,

2673
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.910
they brought the horse over during the Cortez days.

2674
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:55.270
Yes.

2675
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:56.900
And that's why Cortez had no idea.

2676
01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.250
They thought that's what spread influenza through the Mississippi Delta and all

2677
01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:01.240
those different diseases that,

2678
01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:03.100
that native Americans had never been exposed to.

2679
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:08.340
Because when they came back they saw these towns that were empty and yet it was

2680
01:16:08.591 --> 01:16:08.861
like,

2681
01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:10.060
where are all the people?

2682
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:11.350
Well they died off.

2683
01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.330
And what Dan Flores apparently saying,

2684
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:14.500
I'm going to try to get him on soon,

2685
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:19.690
is that the native Americans just with the horse and the firearm were on their

2686
01:16:19.691 --> 01:16:22.700
way to eradicating the buffalo or extra painting.

2687
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:23.201
Meaning,

2688
01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:23.560
you know,

2689
01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.830
instinctually local local extinctions and that,

2690
01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.671
cause they stopped farming,

2691
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:27.911
right?

2692
01:16:27.911 --> 01:16:28.151
They would,

2693
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:28.420
they would,

2694
01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.570
they would follow the Buffalo.

2695
01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:30.340
Yeah,

2696
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:30.991
exactly.

2697
01:16:30.991 --> 01:16:31.100
Yeah,

2698
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.810
because they're fucking 2000 pound animal that just stand still.

2699
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:35.471
I mean,

2700
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:35.740
yeah.

2701
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.710
And they had guns and they were on horses so they could ride as fast as the

2702
01:16:38.711 --> 01:16:40.330
buffalo could run it up to them.

2703
01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.291
It's delicious.

2704
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:42.610
And it's like shooting a house.

2705
01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.050
So they,

2706
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:49.110
what had happened was when the western people came and killed like millions of

2707
01:16:49.961 --> 01:16:51.910
buffaloes and stack them on top of each other.

2708
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:55.360
And the reason why there were so many buffalo in the first place is they had

2709
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.070
gotten wildly out of control,

2710
01:16:57.090 --> 01:17:00.550
wildly out of control because so many native Americans have died really.

2711
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:01.270
I mean,

2712
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.740
we're doing,

2713
01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.050
while we're doing a really bad job of explaining this,

2714
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:06.910
but apparently this guy,

2715
01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:12.350
Dan Flores has some really interesting information and a deep,

2716
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:17.000
deep base of knowledge on this and this subject and all sorts of historical

2717
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:21.230
points of reference reference that he can point to that explains why these

2718
01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:23.210
animals had died off and what was going on.

2719
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.110
But it's,

2720
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:27.350
it's amazing when you think that this country,

2721
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.430
like you're talking about the,

2722
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.730
the very earliest European settlers,

2723
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.410
1,415 hundreds,

2724
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:34.870
that's nothing.

2725
01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:35.661
It's not,

2726
01:17:35.661 --> 01:17:36.740
it's a blink of an eye.

2727
01:17:36.741 --> 01:17:38.090
It's 500 years ago.

2728
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.000
I also think it's

2729
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.500
<v 2>patronize him to suggest that the native Americans weren't exactly like white</v>

2730
01:17:43.501 --> 01:17:46.170
people and a lot of ways in terms of just they,

2731
01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:46.831
they would,

2732
01:17:46.831 --> 01:17:47.281
they of course,

2733
01:17:47.281 --> 01:17:49.050
they would hunt things to expert to a patient.

2734
01:17:49.051 --> 01:17:49.710
I mean,

2735
01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:50.040
<v 3>uh,</v>

2736
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.830
just this human beings let go,

2737
01:17:52.831 --> 01:17:55.080
going to go in that kind of rugged terrain.

2738
01:17:55.081 --> 01:17:55.381
You're going to,

2739
01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:58.200
you're going to follow buffalo if it's that easy and if you kill them,

2740
01:17:58.201 --> 01:17:59.040
you'll go to the next heart.

2741
01:17:59.041 --> 01:17:59.370
Come on.

2742
01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:04.370
But I also do think that the way they were living by taking everything from this

2743
01:18:04.381 --> 01:18:06.660
animal and utilizing every piece of the animal,

2744
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:08.160
utilizing the bones,

2745
01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:11.040
utilize it without a doubt.

2746
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.340
Yeah.

2747
01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.110
And they were more engaged in the whole relationship that they have to these

2748
01:18:16.111 --> 01:18:17.730
animals that they were killing and eating.

2749
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:17.911
Well,

2750
01:18:17.911 --> 01:18:18.430
I think

2751
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.851
<v 2>legacy,</v>

2752
01:18:18.851 --> 01:18:19.870
if we're not careful,

2753
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:21.011
you know,

2754
01:18:21.011 --> 01:18:21.970
our modern man,

2755
01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.810
I'm talking about our legacy in 2014 if we're not careful,

2756
01:18:25.811 --> 01:18:28.360
our legacy may very well be that we destroyed this earth,

2757
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.780
you know,

2758
01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.090
I mean,

2759
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:30.490
or made it a lot worse.

2760
01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.650
And that's,

2761
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.680
that's really hard to stop with the onslaught of technology and all the,

2762
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:38.921
you know,

2763
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:39.681
just the,

2764
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:43.360
the growth of our population and how many resources we need and the byproducts

2765
01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:44.111
and the wastes.

2766
01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:44.944
But,

2767
01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.281
uh,

2768
01:18:45.281 --> 01:18:45.731
that's,

2769
01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:46.960
that's a huge challenge man.

2770
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.970
And I don't know the answer to how you stop it,

2771
01:18:48.971 --> 01:18:49.480
but

2772
01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:49.811
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2773
01:18:49.811 --> 01:18:50.501
it's interesting,

2774
01:18:50.501 --> 01:18:50.910
man.

2775
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:51.170
It's,

2776
01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:53.260
it's really crazy.

2777
01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.470
<v 2>Science is,</v>

2778
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:57.590
is probably the way we're going to figure out.

2779
01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:58.020
Yeah,

2780
01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:58.761
not probably,

2781
01:18:58.761 --> 01:18:59.900
I think it's the only way out.

2782
01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.700
Taking carbon out of the atmosphere,

2783
01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:03.950
growing food with less water and less space.

2784
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:04.630
All that stuff.

2785
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.721
<v 3>Oh,</v>

2786
01:19:04.721 --> 01:19:05.740
somebody corrected me.

2787
01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:07.350
The Dan Carlin episode is a,

2788
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.710
the Prophets of doom.

2789
01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:10.030
That's the one that's on.

2790
01:19:10.031 --> 01:19:10.450
Um,

2791
01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:14.540
thanks to test from the shout out to the test bank profits on board.

2792
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:16.780
That's the Dan Carlin episode.

2793
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.441
But yeah,

2794
01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:17.730
I'm,

2795
01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:18.563
I,

2796
01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:19.090
I'm,

2797
01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:21.190
I'm a really big optimist.

2798
01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:21.341
I mean,

2799
01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:23.740
I'm always hoping that we're going to get our shit together always.

2800
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:28.770
But whether or not I am science is the answer or whether or not Ebola fixes the

2801
01:19:30.701 --> 01:19:32.500
problem or a super volcano,

2802
01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:33.670
we have to start all over again.

2803
01:19:33.671 --> 01:19:34.960
Like the Sumatra volcano.

2804
01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:35.711
I know,

2805
01:19:35.711 --> 01:19:36.880
but can you imagine if we had to start over?

2806
01:19:36.881 --> 01:19:37.481
I was thinking about that.

2807
01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.020
I was like,

2808
01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.150
no university.

2809
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.140
So close to doing some cool stuff.

2810
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.230
What is it cool stuff for?

2811
01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.300
Who's cool stuff for you?

2812
01:19:43.301 --> 01:19:44.200
You're not going to be here to see it.

2813
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:45.400
Cool stuff for your kids.

2814
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.671
I mean,

2815
01:19:45.671 --> 01:19:48.010
what w w our role is very strange.

2816
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.520
Our role is very strange because we're a piece of a puzzle that likes to pretend

2817
01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:53.050
that we're the thing we're,

2818
01:19:53.051 --> 01:19:53.590
we're not,

2819
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:54.011
we're a,

2820
01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:55.630
we're a grain of sand.

2821
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.613
And even,

2822
01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.740
<v 2>but I do think that what I think about is that what gives us meaning is all of</v>

2823
01:20:02.921 --> 01:20:03.220
us,

2824
01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:03.740
no matter,

2825
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:04.930
most of us at least,

2826
01:20:04.931 --> 01:20:06.010
unless you're a crazy person,

2827
01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:08.850
but all us are always working.

2828
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.840
Like even even like Dawkins and people who are sort of nihilists people to say,

2829
01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:15.690
well,

2830
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:16.050
you know,

2831
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:16.261
we're,

2832
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:18.090
we're a grant of San and none of this means anything.

2833
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:18.960
It's all meaningless.

2834
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.370
If that were the case,

2835
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.340
they are still writing books to tell us how meaningful,

2836
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.293
meaningless it is.

2837
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.930
Everybody is very busy working very hard at their own expression.

2838
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:30.030
And I think it's because when we were talking about this,

2839
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:31.170
some people like,

2840
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:31.381
you know,

2841
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:32.910
they want to score social brownie points,

2842
01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:37.911
but for the most part human beings work very hard to try to at least influence

2843
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:39.750
for the better.

2844
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.580
The people that we love,

2845
01:20:41.581 --> 01:20:42.630
the people we're connected to,

2846
01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:43.860
the people that we are,

2847
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:45.810
we're trying to make things better for ourselves.

2848
01:20:45.811 --> 01:20:47.430
But the reality is people that we love,

2849
01:20:47.431 --> 01:20:48.120
our sons

2850
01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.570
<v 3>burning out our planet is going to no longer be able to support life.</v>

2851
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:52.800
Everything is temporary.

2852
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:54.990
It's just the timeline is enormous.

2853
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.000
So like is it doesn't have meaning.

2854
01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:58.530
Sure it has meaning currently,

2855
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.930
but that's what we need to concern ourselves with.

2856
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:01.270
What,

2857
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.890
what happened?

2858
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.110
What holds meaning to you and the people that you love.

2859
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.640
Those things are important.

2860
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.220
But the reality of life on this planet is,

2861
01:21:08.221 --> 01:21:08.850
first of all,

2862
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.050
the reality of human beings.

2863
01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:10.291
You know,

2864
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:12.210
we're joking around about one of my ancestors,

2865
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:13.044
fucking a monkey.

2866
01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.870
But the reality is we are going,

2867
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.170
if,

2868
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:18.210
if human beings stay alive,

2869
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:18.631
okay,

2870
01:21:18.631 --> 01:21:23.400
if civilization continues to innovate and we continue to get to this,

2871
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.030
this insane progression of technology that we're currently involved in,

2872
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.190
that keeps growing and keeps happening,

2873
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:34.490
we will laugh at how goofy and apelike like we weren't 2014 in our search for me

2874
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:35.761
<v 2>machinery,</v>

2875
01:21:35.761 --> 01:21:36.251
which is our,

2876
01:21:36.251 --> 01:21:37.830
our original biology.

2877
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:40.110
It's already becoming obsolete.

2878
01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:40.351
Right?

2879
01:21:40.351 --> 01:21:41.070
That's sort of,

2880
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.420
I mean at the very least it's,

2881
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:42.751
it's,

2882
01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:43.140
it's,

2883
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.490
it's outdated and it's,

2884
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.020
we'll look at our bodies the way we look at a cell phone from the 80s as you're

2885
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:54.021
able to like Mesh your body with machines and you become more efficient in

2886
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:59.140
everything from holding your breath for an hour underwater or red blood cells to

2887
01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:01.110
keep you warm or whatever it might be.

2888
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:02.760
Technology,

2889
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:03.151
tissue,

2890
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:03.901
regeneration,

2891
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:04.740
nanotechnology,

2892
01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:06.010
robotics and,

2893
01:22:06.011 --> 01:22:10.320
and biocompatible machinery like that is going to change our very pilot

2894
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:10.591
<v 3>well,</v>

2895
01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:14.070
which leads a whole new set of problems at a certain point in time.

2896
01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.160
Will we even be a person anymore?

2897
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:20.460
And will we even be what we consider a carbon based life?

2898
01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:22.870
<v 2>Exactly.</v>

2899
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:24.790
Because we're inventing synthetic biology.

2900
01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:26.170
And let's take it a step further,

2901
01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:26.981
uh,

2902
01:22:26.981 --> 01:22:27.281
as,

2903
01:22:27.281 --> 01:22:30.250
as you're able to download memory and you're,

2904
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.350
if you're able to download memory,

2905
01:22:32.351 --> 01:22:35.620
if you're able to download what goes on in our brains,

2906
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:37.500
<v 3>some people criticize him.</v>

2907
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:38.400
You know,

2908
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.910
I've seen people criticize his ideas saying that those things won't be possible.

2909
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.100
But I think what they're missing is that we can replicate it without even

2910
01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:48.780
totally understanding it's processes.

2911
01:22:48.781 --> 01:22:49.420
Like the,

2912
01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:49.580
the,

2913
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:49.811
the,

2914
01:22:49.811 --> 01:22:53.130
the thing is what we don't understand all the complex processes of,

2915
01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:53.760
uh,

2916
01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.031
of,

2917
01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:54.330
you know,

2918
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:58.440
utilizing proteins and this and that and how many steps and phases it takes to

2919
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.274
create a human being.

2920
01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:04.700
But they could recreate what it is to be a human being without all those

2921
01:23:05.711 --> 01:23:08.050
processes if they have a different mechanism.

2922
01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:12.970
So instead of a biological mesic mechanism of cells and proteins and vitamins

2923
01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:14.530
and nutrients and you know,

2924
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.880
neurotransmitters and all the different things that grow into being a person.

2925
01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:20.230
If it's silicon based,

2926
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:25.470
if it's some sort of computer based system emulates all of the processes of

2927
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:27.790
being a human being and does it better maybe.

2928
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.510
Yeah,

2929
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:29.380
very possible.

2930
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:30.423
Very possible.

2931
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.850
Yeah.

2932
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:31.900
I mean look at that dude,

2933
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.660
that guy that shot his wife in South Africa,

2934
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.300
the blade runner do the stories.

2935
01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:37.740
Yeah.

2936
01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.460
I'll say that mother fucker with those stupid blades was running way faster

2937
01:23:42.461 --> 01:23:44.020
probably than he could have without them.

2938
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:44.973
Yeah,

2939
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:45.843
that's right.

2940
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:48.160
Well and the other thing is that we learned more about the brain.

2941
01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:48.550
Like it,

2942
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.710
it,

2943
01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.580
it really throws into question like you people to talk about having out of body

2944
01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:52.414
experiences.

2945
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:53.111
Well,

2946
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:54.370
what they found is they can,

2947
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:55.450
they can manipulate,

2948
01:23:55.451 --> 01:23:59.830
they can touch parts of the brain that give people out of body experiences where

2949
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:02.530
they feel like they're watching everything and their body.

2950
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.860
Which is fascinating to me because that was always sort of the idea and we're

2951
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:07.120
looking down as I was dying,

2952
01:24:07.121 --> 01:24:08.650
I could see myself and all that.

2953
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.191
Well,

2954
01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:11.650
it may be that there's a chemical thing going on in the brain where you

2955
01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:12.220
actually,

2956
01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.890
you can actually manipulate that and replicate that process.

2957
01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.290
It's just not even maybe,

2958
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:17.681
well,

2959
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:20.650
here's the other thing we know about dreams.

2960
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.830
Dreams are a very real thing.

2961
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:25.090
Everyone.

2962
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:26.163
I think everyone,

2963
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.900
most people have dream.

2964
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.270
Yeah.

2965
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:29.110
So what is a dream?

2966
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.310
A dream is an illusion.

2967
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:31.720
It's not really happening.

2968
01:24:31.721 --> 01:24:32.590
What's something,

2969
01:24:32.591 --> 01:24:35.280
you were imagining something really intricate and DTI,

2970
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.320
some fucking crazy dreams when we were sleeping in tents and in Alaska.

2971
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:42.100
Really bizarre dreams.

2972
01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.690
So when you know,

2973
01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:45.250
you're talking about near death experiences,

2974
01:24:45.251 --> 01:24:48.740
the people are unconscious when they're having these like of like,

2975
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.301
oh,

2976
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:51.130
there's so much deep meaning to it really.

2977
01:24:51.190 --> 01:24:51.461
Well,

2978
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:52.390
I was on a skateboard,

2979
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:55.480
I was getting chased by Godzilla and a dream is there deep meaning in that

2980
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.340
because both of them are illusions.

2981
01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:59.140
You weren't really flying above your body.

2982
01:24:59.320 --> 01:24:59.711
Okay.

2983
01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:01.390
And I wasn't really getting chased by Godzilla.

2984
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:04.450
They both probably seemed equally real.

2985
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:10.110
And the idea of a dream in an of itself is a very fucking strange thing.

2986
01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:13.120
You shut your brain off every night,

2987
01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:18.220
you close your eyes and your mind starts a process that we don't totally

2988
01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:18.970
understand.

2989
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:22.480
We know there's a bunch of things happening like rem sleep,

2990
01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:24.070
rapid eye movement.

2991
01:25:24.071 --> 01:25:28.870
We know now that there's neurotransmitters that are moving in and out of the

2992
01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:32.710
brain and fucking around with your consciousness while you're out.

2993
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.530
And we know what processes are shutting down and turn it off.

2994
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.530
But we don't totally understand what dreaming is.

2995
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.940
We don't understand it.

2996
01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:42.970
We really don't understand why we even need it.

2997
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:43.923
It's amazing.

2998
01:25:44.170 --> 01:25:45.003
It's incredible.

2999
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:47.590
So when someone talks about like having a near death experience,

3000
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:48.191
like yeah,

3001
01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:49.330
maybe you're fucking dreaming,

3002
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.870
you know,

3003
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:50.081
like,

3004
01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:50.560
I don't know.

3005
01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:50.710
Yeah,

3006
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:51.371
I don't know what happened.

3007
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:52.130
You don't either.

3008
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:54.610
And I know it changed me so much,

3009
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:56.560
but I think eventually my father it out,

3010
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.011
that's for sure.

3011
01:25:57.011 --> 01:25:58.810
At least be able to replicate dreams or have,

3012
01:25:58.811 --> 01:25:59.320
you know,

3013
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.100
perhaps maybe we will transcend before we figure it down.

3014
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:04.280
I mean we might abandon

3015
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.770
<v 1>the body before we even totally understand its processes.</v>

3016
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.140
It really throws into turmoil.

3017
01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:12.020
The people who have strict orthodox religious beliefs too.

3018
01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:13.640
I mean it's already fucked.

3019
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.751
They're already fucked.

3020
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:14.901
You know,

3021
01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:17.860
I was watching this video before you got here at Richard Dawkins arguing with

3022
01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:22.460
Islamic people and this guy was talking about how moral Islam is and how it's

3023
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:24.110
important and ethics and this and that.

3024
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:26.630
And Dawkins just kept hammering this dude.

3025
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.231
He said,

3026
01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:30.890
what is the price that you must pay if you abandon Islam?

3027
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.930
And the guy didn't want to answer it.

3028
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:33.120
You got,

3029
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.040
I didn't want to answer it.

3030
01:26:34.041 --> 01:26:35.030
And then he went back to it.

3031
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:35.721
What is it?

3032
01:26:35.721 --> 01:26:36.320
A Pos.

3033
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.180
A pasta fee state apostate.

3034
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.350
But what's the,

3035
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:41.720
what's the actual expression of leaving?

3036
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:42.560
It's not,

3037
01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.180
you don't say,

3038
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:43.611
oh I have,

3039
01:26:43.611 --> 01:26:44.760
I committed the stage.

3040
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.300
You're in a pasta pasta fee,

3041
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.150
so I don't know,

3042
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:47.983
whatever it is.

3043
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:48.681
What's the,

3044
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:48.960
what?

3045
01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.491
What is,

3046
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:50.324
what is,

3047
01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.310
what is the Jelly?

3048
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.501
Right?

3049
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:52.210
But what's the,

3050
01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:53.043
what is it like,

3051
01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:54.083
you know,

3052
01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.410
I don't know perjure yourself.

3053
01:26:57.411 --> 01:26:58.101
It's called perjury.

3054
01:26:58.101 --> 01:26:59.930
Whatever apostrophe I think it's called.

3055
01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:00.893
But anyway,

3056
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.903
the guy wouldn't answer.

3057
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.661
He didn't want to answer it.

3058
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:04.940
He was trying to skirt around it and Dawkins kept hammering them.

3059
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:05.481
It's finally,

3060
01:27:05.481 --> 01:27:05.811
he goes,

3061
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:06.650
it's the death penalty.

3062
01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:07.070
He goes,

3063
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.251
well,

3064
01:27:07.251 --> 01:27:08.084
there you go.

3065
01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.960
You leave Islam and it's you have to be killed.

3066
01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:12.770
It's that.

3067
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:14.150
That's in your religion.

3068
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:15.051
Don't understand it.

3069
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:16.190
That's fucking crazy.

3070
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.780
Like that's the death penalty.

3071
01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.210
And the guy was just like stammering.

3072
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:22.280
He was just stuck there because that is the reality,

3073
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:27.370
not only that in Islamic countries and do some insane number like in the 90

3074
01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:31.610
percentile believe that you should be stoned to death for adultery.

3075
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:32.180
Well,

3076
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:32.501
but,

3077
01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:34.640
but I have to just having lived there for a long time,

3078
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:36.410
I do have to come to the defense of the fact that,

3079
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:38.600
that those,

3080
01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:39.530
just like with,

3081
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.600
with the book of Deuteronomy and Judaism,

3082
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:44.060
which says exactly the same thing by the way,

3083
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.790
most Muslims have,

3084
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.640
you leave Christianity,

3085
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:47.240
you get killed.

3086
01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:47.421
No.

3087
01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:48.890
And the dude book of Deuteronomy,

3088
01:27:48.891 --> 01:27:51.950
I mean a lot of those laws come from the Old Testament and remember that the

3089
01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:54.230
Quran was very heavily influenced by the Old Testament,

3090
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:54.750
the Quran.

3091
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:57.770
In many ways is a rebuttal to the New Testament saying that Jesus Christ is not

3092
01:27:57.771 --> 01:27:58.370
God.

3093
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.641
But,

3094
01:27:58.641 --> 01:27:58.910
but,

3095
01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:03.910
but most of the 10 commandments and things are held as chronic laws.

3096
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.971
Well,

3097
01:28:04.971 --> 01:28:05.690
okay,

3098
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:06.081
so,

3099
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:06.510
so,

3100
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.751
so,

3101
01:28:06.751 --> 01:28:07.310
but it does it,

3102
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:09.680
where's the debris from the old Jewish law?

3103
01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.900
Where does it ever say that if you leave Christianity,

3104
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:13.100
you're supposed to be killed?

3105
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:13.640
It doesn't,

3106
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.330
I'm talking about,

3107
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.760
I'm just saying that Islam got that from Judaism.

3108
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:17.670
Okay.

3109
01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:17.800
That,

3110
01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.531
that's what I'm saying.

3111
01:28:18.531 --> 01:28:19.040
And so,

3112
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:19.220
and,

3113
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:19.311
but,

3114
01:28:19.311 --> 01:28:22.620
but the point I was making is that I don't understand Muslims.

3115
01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:23.770
I would,

3116
01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:25.400
I would guarantee,

3117
01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:27.440
I promise you don't believe that adultery,

3118
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:30.050
that you should stone a woman to death the most.

3119
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:31.580
Muslims aren't even that religious.

3120
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:34.610
And there's this misconception and also Islam is very,

3121
01:28:34.611 --> 01:28:36.590
very the religion.

3122
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:39.470
If you look at the difference between Indonesian Muslims for example,

3123
01:28:39.471 --> 01:28:43.100
and Wahabi Muslims who are in Saudi Arabia,

3124
01:28:43.101 --> 01:28:46.310
it's vastly different because the way they interpret the Quran,

3125
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:47.181
the Quran is,

3126
01:28:47.181 --> 01:28:48.080
can be interpreted.

3127
01:28:48.081 --> 01:28:51.560
It's the most easily in widely interpreted religion as well.

3128
01:28:51.561 --> 01:28:52.220
It leaves very,

3129
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:52.551
very,

3130
01:28:52.551 --> 01:28:53.990
very open for interpretation.

3131
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.183
So,

3132
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:55.790
so,

3133
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:59.050
and that's what Nick Islamic scholars were always tell you in.

3134
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.040
And most Muslims don't hold that

3135
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.520
<v 3>point of view.</v>

3136
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:02.700
Right.

3137
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.450
But he's just not like saying that most Christians believe in evolution.

3138
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.850
I mean it's like what is the,

3139
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.830
what is the religion based on?

3140
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:14.940
If you start deviating from it and adding in a bunch of your own thoughts and

3141
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:18.930
then just sort of ignoring the old stuff like old and all that stuff they did.

3142
01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:19.380
Yeah.

3143
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:19.911
But that does it.

3144
01:29:19.911 --> 01:29:20.460
But that does,

3145
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.540
does that matter?

3146
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.090
Because a bunch of people still do that.

3147
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.580
That mean isn't the heart of it's still ridiculous.

3148
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.890
I think that Dawkins though might be harping on an excel on,

3149
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.720
on one aspect of Islam.

3150
01:29:33.721 --> 01:29:33.931
When,

3151
01:29:33.931 --> 01:29:34.231
when,

3152
01:29:34.231 --> 01:29:34.890
what?

3153
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:35.030
No,

3154
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.190
no,

3155
01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:35.820
no,

3156
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:36.261
he was,

3157
01:29:36.261 --> 01:29:36.810
he was,

3158
01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:38.850
he was talking in broad terms,

3159
01:29:38.851 --> 01:29:41.310
but he wanted to pick one very important point.

3160
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:43.890
Like when people are talking about it being in a religion of peace,

3161
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.000
he was saying really well,

3162
01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:47.580
how come if you leave you're supposed to be killed.

3163
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:48.810
That's not peaceful.

3164
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.211
<v 2>I,</v>

3165
01:29:50.211 --> 01:29:50.410
and,

3166
01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:50.650
and,

3167
01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:51.790
and that's a very good point.

3168
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.790
A very good question.

3169
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.670
And an important question to ask.

3170
01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.540
I also think that there is also value in Islam too.

3171
01:29:59.541 --> 01:30:02.930
A lot of Muslims because it is a blueprint for how to live their lives and it

3172
01:30:02.931 --> 01:30:03.764
works for them.

3173
01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:04.500
Uh,

3174
01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.181
for example,

3175
01:30:05.181 --> 01:30:07.070
be charitable to people,

3176
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:07.760
charities,

3177
01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.990
a very big part of Islam.

3178
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:10.183
Um,

3179
01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.090
you know,

3180
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:14.600
there are a lot of examples of that modesty charity and things like that.

3181
01:30:14.601 --> 01:30:15.770
It's when people take,

3182
01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.090
interpret these things,

3183
01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.620
literally I,

3184
01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:19.640
he fundamentally,

3185
01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:22.760
or if they take it as symbology as,

3186
01:30:22.761 --> 01:30:23.031
as,

3187
01:30:23.031 --> 01:30:24.500
as a suggestions for how to live here.

3188
01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.250
Just like you can be a Christian fundamentalist and you're going to be a very

3189
01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:31.250
different person than if you are a regular Christian who takes this symbolism,

3190
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:31.620
<v 3>Jamie,</v>

3191
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.180
pull up just Google,

3192
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:36.660
not radical Islam and then pull up a video,

3193
01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:40.680
pull up videos from not radical Islam on Google.

3194
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:42.750
And it's the very first video it's called.

3195
01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:44.400
It's not the radical,

3196
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.410
it's Islam.

3197
01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.130
When,

3198
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:48.150
I don't know what the word is.

3199
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.990
S H,

3200
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.351
a.

3201
01:30:49.351 --> 01:30:50.610
Y.

3202
01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:50.610
K.

3203
01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:50.640
H,

3204
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.473
what's that word?

3205
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.713
I Dunno how,

3206
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.471
but anyway,

3207
01:30:55.471 --> 01:30:57.000
this guy is being interviewed.

3208
01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.700
This guy is communicating with this group of people.

3209
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:00.481
And,

3210
01:31:00.481 --> 01:31:00.790
uh,

3211
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:04.230
there are all these other Islamics or other Muslims,

3212
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.310
and he's talking about how people are confused about what radical Islam is and

3213
01:31:08.311 --> 01:31:11.100
what's just actual Islam and what the,

3214
01:31:11.101 --> 01:31:13.710
what the law is and what you're supposed to do.

3215
01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.760
And watch this video.

3216
01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:23.680
<v 6>They always attack the Muslims or Islam in particular while for cert.</v>

3217
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:27.710
Can't hear example about gays and put your headphones on the old as the Coulson

3218
01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.390
and the teachings of,

3219
01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.300
towards this matter.

3220
01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:31.134
For example,

3221
01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:35.040
while in Christianity in Judaism it's the same punishment,

3222
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:36.503
uh,

3223
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.853
that exists.

3224
01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:38.810
It's Harambe.

3225
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:41.010
And so why they're always,

3226
01:31:41.011 --> 01:31:41.491
for example,

3227
01:31:41.491 --> 01:31:46.050
focusing on Islam and not a Judaism or Christianity.

3228
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:46.980
While for example,

3229
01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:51.660
also in Jerusalem for those who've been to Jerusalem and the bosses in

3230
01:31:51.661 --> 01:31:52.081
Jerusalem,

3231
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:52.914
for example,

3232
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:55.380
women's sits separate than men for example.

3233
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:55.561
You know,

3234
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:57.650
so why like five minutes ago or,

3235
01:31:57.651 --> 01:31:58.261
or early,

3236
01:31:58.261 --> 01:32:00.760
we were asked about why Muslims,

3237
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:01.450
uh,

3238
01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:04.030
has to be sitting separate men and women,

3239
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:08.140
but they never ask a these questions to Jews or Christians.

3240
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:09.880
Why specifically Muslims or Islam?

3241
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.740
Didn't you answer this question yesterday?

3242
01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:15.040
And you said that you need to ask the media.

3243
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:16.620
Yeah.

3244
01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:17.250
Yes,

3245
01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:18.083
it's true.

3246
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.033
Yeah.

3247
01:32:21.450 --> 01:32:22.480
He wasn't a tear,

3248
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:23.780
but the other people were here.

3249
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:24.390
Yeah,

3250
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.800
there are there people who will suffer because of you.

3251
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.910
The answer's very simple.

3252
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:34.630
Islam as the truth and in Christianity and Judaism and not the truth.

3253
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:40.360
<v 7>This topic may I shift,</v>

3254
01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.560
but you are the chef.

3255
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.353
You're the doctor.

3256
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.243
I said,

3257
01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:51.360
can we have the camera?

3258
01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.150
Can we have this camera focusing on all the audience?

3259
01:32:54.151 --> 01:32:54.984
Sarah,

3260
01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:58.680
can we have this camera focusing on older audience because

3261
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:01.790
every now and then,

3262
01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:03.410
every time we have a conference,

3263
01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.270
every time we invite a speaker,

3264
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:09.620
they always can come with the same accusations.

3265
01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:15.460
This speaker supports death penalty for homosexuals.

3266
01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.880
This speaker supports death penalty for this crime,

3267
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:22.520
this crime that he is homophobic,

3268
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.130
they subjugate women,

3269
01:33:25.131 --> 01:33:25.730
et Cetera,

3270
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:26.211
et Cetera,

3271
01:33:26.211 --> 01:33:26.601
et cetera.

3272
01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:31.601
It's the same old stuff coming all the time and we always try to tell them.

3273
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:34.790
I always try to tell them that,

3274
01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:35.893
look,

3275
01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.200
it's not that speaker that we are in whiting who has this extreme radical views.

3276
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:42.283
As you say,

3277
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:47.780
these are general views that every Muslim actually has.

3278
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:50.030
Every Muslim believes in these things.

3279
01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.390
Just because they're not telling you about it.

3280
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:56.780
Just because they're not out there in the media doesn't mean they don't believe

3281
01:33:56.781 --> 01:33:57.614
in them.

3282
01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.600
So I would ask you,

3283
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:02.300
everyone in the room,

3284
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:07.860
how many of you are normal Muslims do not extremists.

3285
01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:09.080
They're not radical.

3286
01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.090
This is normal Sunni Muslims.

3287
01:34:11.091 --> 01:34:11.990
Please raise your hands.

3288
01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.501
Everybody.

3289
01:34:15.501 --> 01:34:16.300
Mashallah.

3290
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.920
Panela okay,

3291
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:18.770
take down your hands again.

3292
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:25.300
How many of you agree that men and women should sit separate?

3293
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:28.520
Please raise your hands.

3294
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:30.620
All of them raised their hands.

3295
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:31.431
Yeah,

3296
01:34:31.431 --> 01:34:32.180
both lunch.

3297
01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.950
This is everyone agreed.

3298
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:35.090
Everyone agreed.

3299
01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:36.290
The brothers and sisters,

3300
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.920
it's not just this radical shifts.

3301
01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:41.350
Then Allahu Akbar.

3302
01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.313
Next question.

3303
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:47.470
How many of you agree that the punishments described in the n and the sooner

3304
01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.070
whether it is death,

3305
01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:54.270
whether it is stoning for adultery,

3306
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:55.340
whatever it is,

3307
01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.700
if it is from a and his messenger,

3308
01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:04.010
that is the best punishment ever possible for humankind.

3309
01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:07.160
And that is what we should apply in the world.

3310
01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:07.670
Well homer,

3311
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.780
who agrees with that and they all raise their hand a lot of work.

3312
01:35:11.781 --> 01:35:13.820
But are you all the radical extremists?

3313
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.213
Panela.

3314
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.710
So all of you are saying that you are common Muslims,

3315
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:23.840
you all go to the different massages?

3316
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:24.440
No Way.

3317
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.273
Or is it,

3318
01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.930
are you like a specific sector like the Islam,

3319
01:35:28.931 --> 01:35:30.350
that sec to anything like that?

3320
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.393
Are you like that?

3321
01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:32.493
Nah.

3322
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.010
Is it the [inaudible] please raise your hand if you like this extreme Islam,

3323
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:38.300
that sector or anything like that.

3324
01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.620
No one a lot work.

3325
01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:44.550
But how many of you just go to this normal massage massage?

3326
01:35:44.551 --> 01:35:45.384
It's in Norway.

3327
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:46.350
The normal student.

3328
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:48.020
Pseudonymous please raise your hands.

3329
01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:49.813
Raise your hands.

3330
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:52.070
Allahu Akbar.

3331
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:54.463
God is great.

3332
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.900
What's the politicians going to say now?

3333
01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:01.430
What does the media going to say now that we're all extremists were all

3334
01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:02.150
radicals.

3335
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:06.320
We need to deport all of us from this country had a law,

3336
01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:08.051
a law hawk,

3337
01:36:08.051 --> 01:36:08.884
but duck,

3338
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:11.423
duck beer.

3339
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:13.320
It's a beer.

3340
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.340
Maybe have the next question please.

3341
01:36:18.450 --> 01:36:18.790
<v 1>I don't,</v>

3342
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:19.141
come on.

3343
01:36:19.141 --> 01:36:19.891
I don't.

3344
01:36:19.891 --> 01:36:22.420
I don't like those kind of videos to be honest with you because I,

3345
01:36:22.421 --> 01:36:26.640
I happen to think that if you took a cross section of people from all over the

3346
01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:27.361
Muslim world,

3347
01:36:27.361 --> 01:36:29.340
you'd find very different points of view.

3348
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.760
You'd find people who were way more liberal than that guy.

3349
01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:33.391
Uh,

3350
01:36:33.391 --> 01:36:35.580
and I think it's because people are living their lives.

3351
01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:37.440
They don't even have time to go to mosque.

3352
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.940
Just like you see with Christians,

3353
01:36:38.941 --> 01:36:39.930
just like you see what Jews,

3354
01:36:39.931 --> 01:36:41.160
there's a great deal of debate.

3355
01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:45.360
I think the problem with the Muslim world today is a most moderate Muslims and

3356
01:36:45.361 --> 01:36:47.400
that's most are just silent.

3357
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:47.671
Okay?

3358
01:36:47.671 --> 01:36:48.750
But what does that mean though?

3359
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:49.591
What it means?

3360
01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:50.090
What it means,

3361
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:53.100
said he's saying on stage when he's asking you,

3362
01:36:53.101 --> 01:36:53.520
are you,

3363
01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.620
are you regular Muslims?

3364
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:57.150
And if you are regular with slums,

3365
01:36:57.151 --> 01:36:57.600
raise your hand.

3366
01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.433
They raise their hand.

3367
01:36:58.710 --> 01:37:03.710
If you believe that the message that's in the Koran is the correct way to handle

3368
01:37:03.841 --> 01:37:04.531
any situation,

3369
01:37:04.531 --> 01:37:07.380
raise your hand if you believe that it's the way to handle adultery.

3370
01:37:07.410 --> 01:37:09.060
Raise your hand and they're all raising their hand.

3371
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:10.230
Those are real people.

3372
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.160
They're not real people.

3373
01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:12.590
I don't know who those people are like,

3374
01:37:12.591 --> 01:37:13.410
Whoa,

3375
01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:14.243
what does that mean?

3376
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.791
What does that mean?

3377
01:37:14.791 --> 01:37:15.091
I don't know.

3378
01:37:15.091 --> 01:37:15.760
There's people that are going on,

3379
01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:16.051
whether it is,

3380
01:37:16.051 --> 01:37:17.430
I don't know what the context is.

3381
01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:17.881
I mean,

3382
01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:19.670
I don't think that's a good example

3383
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:25.710
because the room people full of people like that in that clip is not,

3384
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:28.860
not necessarily a good representation of most Muslims.

3385
01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.060
It just isn't.

3386
01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:30.730
I,

3387
01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:31.291
you know,

3388
01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:33.690
I think there are problems with Islam like any other religion.

3389
01:37:33.691 --> 01:37:35.700
I think there are problems with certain populations of,

3390
01:37:35.701 --> 01:37:37.320
of Muslims who have an isolated,

3391
01:37:37.530 --> 01:37:38.070
there's a lot of,

3392
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:40.530
there might be a lot of ignorance in certain parts of the world,

3393
01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:43.740
like the Middle East where there isn't a lot of money or exposure to other

3394
01:37:43.741 --> 01:37:44.341
ideas.

3395
01:37:44.341 --> 01:37:44.791
Yes,

3396
01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:47.040
but I think that that is,

3397
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:51.030
that is very anti-Islamic in very slanted in its own way.

3398
01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:51.391
Wait a minute,

3399
01:37:51.391 --> 01:37:53.700
what is just just taking a,

3400
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.371
not the,

3401
01:37:54.371 --> 01:37:55.080
I'm not saying you,

3402
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.831
I'm saying when you,

3403
01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:56.020
when,

3404
01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.780
<v 3>if you took that and you look at one video and decide that's how Muslims think</v>

3405
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:01.673
in general.

3406
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:02.610
I think it's a mistake.

3407
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:03.460
First of all,

3408
01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:08.460
this video is a pro Islam site that puts this video of this video was put up by

3409
01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:11.250
Islam net video,

3410
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:16.340
islam.net and what they're trying to tell you is that these ideas that people

3411
01:38:16.771 --> 01:38:19.440
are calling radical Islam are not radical.

3412
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.420
They are just Islamic ideas.

3413
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:24.100
This is not like a proper arm to video.

3414
01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:25.020
I've read the Quran.

3415
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.620
They are,

3416
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.260
but it we'll put home saying is this is not a propaganda video.

3417
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:31.740
This is a pro Islamic website that's putting these videos out.

3418
01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.320
I understand.

3419
01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.320
All I'm saying is that that fee that to me that that video to me leaves non

3420
01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:43.960
Muslims with the impression that all Muslims are extreme and what I'm saying is

3421
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:46.620
I don't believe that they are.

3422
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.150
I mean this country,

3423
01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:53.151
a Christian country for all intents and purposes puts a great number of people

3424
01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:58.080
to death and we have a lot of people on death row for four crimes especially in

3425
01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.590
the state is non sec.

3426
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.340
It is a secular thing.

3427
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:04.050
It's not done because of religion.

3428
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.620
When you put people in jail or kill them because of murder.

3429
01:39:07.621 --> 01:39:09.570
You're not doing it because it's in the Bible,

3430
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:13.620
but our justice system is very much based on the notion that everybody said the

3431
01:39:13.621 --> 01:39:14.760
same world we're worth,

3432
01:39:14.761 --> 01:39:16.080
which is a Christian idea.

3433
01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:16.381
Yeah,

3434
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:17.880
but because it's a Christian idea,

3435
01:39:17.881 --> 01:39:19.650
it's not based on the Christian faith,

3436
01:39:19.651 --> 01:39:22.020
meaning you have to be a Christian to ascribe to it.

3437
01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.520
Like these ideas are very,

3438
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:24.630
this is very different.

3439
01:39:24.631 --> 01:39:28.530
Like no one is saying that God says that we should kill people for adultery,

3440
01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:30.570
so we have to kill people for adultery in this country.

3441
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:33.600
Like we're talking about crimes against other human beings.

3442
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.820
That's the reason why people were killed in this country.

3443
01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:36.601
I mean,

3444
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:38.480
when you're killing someone in Texas for murder,

3445
01:39:38.481 --> 01:39:40.980
I understand you're not doing it because it's a crime against God.

3446
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:44.550
What what you're seeing in that video is a religion.

3447
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:47.100
You're seeing a representation of religion.

3448
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:49.770
Are there more moderate representations of that religion?

3449
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:50.730
It's an unquestionably.

3450
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:51.564
There certainly are,

3451
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.460
but at what point in time,

3452
01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.530
what is the religion then?

3453
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.460
I mean if becomes more moderate and if you don't ascribe to certain things that

3454
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:03.210
are in this ancient texts that tell you there's very clear laws and rules that

3455
01:40:03.211 --> 01:40:04.640
you're supposed to abide by.

3456
01:40:04.641 --> 01:40:05.400
It's the question.

3457
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.320
That's a weird question.

3458
01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:07.650
What is the religion then?

3459
01:40:07.651 --> 01:40:08.880
What is a religion at all?

3460
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:09.810
If you just decide,

3461
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:09.931
well,

3462
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:13.440
we're going to morph it because it's 2014 and we think that the new evidence

3463
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:16.710
show that homosexuals are actually born and it's not their fault,

3464
01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:19.290
it's just a part of genetics and it's part of life itself.

3465
01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:21.240
It's like having red hair or a big nose.

3466
01:40:21.241 --> 01:40:23.410
You some people are gay and that's a really,

3467
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.140
really good question and I think that,

3468
01:40:25.141 --> 01:40:26.700
I think in my opinion,

3469
01:40:27.330 --> 01:40:28.320
I think you could,

3470
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.060
you could identify as a Christian,

3471
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:30.721
as a Muslim,

3472
01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:31.260
as a,

3473
01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:36.000
as a Jew and not hold all the tenants of that particular religion,

3474
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.330
but why then what is a,

3475
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.370
are you just a human that just accepts you?

3476
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.130
You pull and choose and play.

3477
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:45.120
We'll do it all the time,

3478
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.331
right,

3479
01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:46.380
but what is that then?

3480
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:47.760
How are you a Christian?

3481
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.610
You're not subscribing to the full ideology.

3482
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:50.951
You're,

3483
01:40:50.951 --> 01:40:51.960
you're not a fundamentalist,

3484
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:52.831
but what are you?

3485
01:40:52.831 --> 01:40:53.531
Then you're,

3486
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:53.861
you're,

3487
01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:54.130
you're

3488
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:55.570
<v 1>a believer who believes in the,</v>

3489
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.070
in not in the letter of the law,

3490
01:40:57.071 --> 01:40:58.300
but rather in the symbol,

3491
01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.111
in the idea,

3492
01:40:59.111 --> 01:41:03.580
in the suggestion and the idea that we can reach to be as good as we can be and

3493
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:07.600
that some laws that were written 15 1400 years ago in this case or whatever,

3494
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:11.800
I think that's how long it was our outdated because science,

3495
01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:12.550
et Cetera,

3496
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:15.850
is starting to show us that a lot of those laws do not hold relevance in our

3497
01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:19.060
everyday lives and in fact are probably unethical or immoral.

3498
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.060
But isn't that completely fascinating when you look at all these different

3499
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:25.300
countries that do believe that if you leave Islam,

3500
01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:26.163
you are,

3501
01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.370
you're a dead person.

3502
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:28.060
You should be killed.

3503
01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.350
If you commit adultery,

3504
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:30.460
you're a dead person.

3505
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:31.294
You should be killed.

3506
01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:31.691
I mean,

3507
01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:33.190
there's a bunch of different things.

3508
01:41:33.191 --> 01:41:34.270
If you are homosexual,

3509
01:41:34.271 --> 01:41:35.390
you should be killed with raw,

3510
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.850
very important questions to ask.

3511
01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:38.980
And very important for the Muslim world to debate.

3512
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.900
And they're going through that debate right now.

3513
01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:43.690
Just like Judaism and Christianity went through that debate.

3514
01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:44.770
I mean,

3515
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:46.420
how many people were burned at the stake in,

3516
01:41:46.421 --> 01:41:46.721
in,

3517
01:41:46.721 --> 01:41:47.650
in the name of,

3518
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.400
of,

3519
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:48.731
you know,

3520
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:53.140
witchcraft in Salem and all over Europe for that matter because they were not

3521
01:41:53.141 --> 01:41:54.520
what could Christians,

3522
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:55.540
um,

3523
01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:55.880
you know,

3524
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.740
so I think,

3525
01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:58.640
I think this is a product of a religion under,

3526
01:41:59.170 --> 01:41:59.860
you know,

3527
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:03.190
I think actually that these debates and the questions you're asking,

3528
01:42:03.191 --> 01:42:07.720
which are also being asked in the Muslim world are crucial because it's how a

3529
01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:08.554
religion,

3530
01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:09.610
you know,

3531
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.240
it's,

3532
01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:10.631
it's the,

3533
01:42:10.631 --> 01:42:13.480
it's the process or religion must go through and contend with.

3534
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:17.620
It's got the favor or oppose making sharia the law of the land.

3535
01:42:17.621 --> 01:42:22.450
This is the percentage of Muslims who favor making Islamic law the official law

3536
01:42:22.451 --> 01:42:24.070
in their country ready for this.

3537
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.881
Afghanistan,

3538
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:27.580
99% Pakistan,

3539
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:29.710
84% Bangladesh,

3540
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:31.120
82% Iraq,

3541
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:33.850
91% Palestine,

3542
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.590
89% Morocco,

3543
01:42:35.591 --> 01:42:38.140
83% I mean these are crazy numbers.

3544
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:40.330
Niger in Subsaharan Africa,

3545
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:43.010
86% a lot of this country's,

3546
01:42:43.011 --> 01:42:43.540
how I would,

3547
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:47.830
I would imagine are also very poor and I don't know how they're polling,

3548
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.970
but I think a lot of us,

3549
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.781
those countries,

3550
01:42:49.781 --> 01:42:50.650
when you've got nothing,

3551
01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:51.520
you turned to religion.

3552
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:54.040
Now the way you solve that problem is with commerce.

3553
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:54.790
Yeah,

3554
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:55.480
right.

3555
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.111
It is a,

3556
01:42:56.111 --> 01:42:57.700
it is a scary thought though,

3557
01:42:57.701 --> 01:43:00.070
that we're in this part of the world.

3558
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:03.790
There's a giant chunk of human beings that have these ideals.

3559
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:04.600
I mean these are,

3560
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.600
these are ideas that are incredibly common in giant chunks of the world.

3561
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.230
Millions of people.

3562
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:14.500
And when you're talking about what a religion is,

3563
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:15.760
and there's so many moderates,

3564
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:16.181
well,

3565
01:43:16.181 --> 01:43:17.980
what is this religion then?

3566
01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:18.221
I mean,

3567
01:43:18.221 --> 01:43:20.710
if there are moderates who don't believe you should be stoned to death,

3568
01:43:20.711 --> 01:43:22.270
who don't believe that you should be killed if you leave,

3569
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:25.660
who don't believe he's killed should be chilled with rocks if you're an adult or

3570
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:27.400
what is that religion then?

3571
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.610
I mean at what point in time does it sort of dwindle off?

3572
01:43:30.611 --> 01:43:31.720
Does it go away?

3573
01:43:31.721 --> 01:43:35.470
Does it Iraq is place apple like that statistic is very surprising to me and I'm

3574
01:43:35.471 --> 01:43:37.090
not sure I believe it because Iraq was,

3575
01:43:37.091 --> 01:43:39.370
remember it was basically under Saddam Hussein.

3576
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.150
You weren't really allowed to even bring a Koran to school or to a public place.

3577
01:43:43.151 --> 01:43:45.020
It was the sheer our way are,

3578
01:43:45.021 --> 01:43:45.171
are,

3579
01:43:45.171 --> 01:43:48.400
are a little bit more religious in some ways then,

3580
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:48.850
then the,

3581
01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:49.683
then the Sunni,

3582
01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:50.260
although that's,

3583
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.040
that's a big actually with Isis.

3584
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.510
<v 2>Those are,</v>

3585
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:53.090
they are,

3586
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:56.630
they believe in Wahab and Wa in Wahhabi,

3587
01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.770
Wahhabi Islam and stuff.

3588
01:43:57.771 --> 01:43:58.430
But,

3589
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:59.250
um,

3590
01:43:59.250 --> 01:43:59.860
I,

3591
01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:00.830
I think that,

3592
01:44:00.831 --> 01:44:01.131
you know,

3593
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:03.560
Iraq from what I understand was essentially,

3594
01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.433
um,

3595
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.570
they were baptists,

3596
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.030
which was the idea was that you were secular,

3597
01:44:08.031 --> 01:44:08.191
that,

3598
01:44:08.191 --> 01:44:08.421
that,

3599
01:44:08.421 --> 01:44:13.130
that all Arab should band together and there should be sort of this belt of Arab

3600
01:44:13.131 --> 01:44:13.964
unity,

3601
01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:14.450
uh,

3602
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:17.120
which was what a Nazi was trying to do in Egypt,

3603
01:44:17.121 --> 01:44:17.541
et Cetera,

3604
01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:17.961
et cetera.

3605
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:20.390
Unify the Arabs under one sort of,

3606
01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:20.631
but,

3607
01:44:20.631 --> 01:44:25.631
but so I'm going to say it was very sort of until later on was very anti Islam

3608
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:26.990
in a lot of ways.

3609
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.321
Yeah.

3610
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:29.030
Well that was a secular nation.

3611
01:44:29.031 --> 01:44:31.220
It was a secular nation before we invaded it.

3612
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:34.760
And now it's a civil war between two varying sects of Islam.

3613
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.480
Yeah.

3614
01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.220
It's just to me,

3615
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:41.900
I think that ideologies are very dangerous and they are rigid ideologies that

3616
01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:44.840
are thousands of years old are the most dangerous hundred percent.

3617
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:46.670
Speaking of seventh heaven.

3618
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.133
Oh boy.

3619
01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:53.150
There's a show that Brian used to be on a religious show.

3620
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:53.781
Right?

3621
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:54.230
I mean,

3622
01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:56.050
I have to pee because I want to talk about this.

3623
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:57.380
Very good.

3624
01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:57.950
Go,

3625
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:59.220
go do your little squirt and we'll,

3626
01:44:59.230 --> 01:45:00.230
we'll talk about this,

3627
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:00.690
this

3628
01:45:00.690 --> 01:45:03.690
<v 3>because this is fucking really spooky stuff.</v>

3629
01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:07.920
There was a show called seventh heaven and Brian was on it.

3630
01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:09.421
He,

3631
01:45:09.421 --> 01:45:09.690
uh,

3632
01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:12.750
I don't remember the exact nature of the show,

3633
01:45:12.751 --> 01:45:14.850
but it had something to do with religion.

3634
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:16.183
Um,

3635
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:17.663
he,

3636
01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:18.301
so anyway,

3637
01:45:18.301 --> 01:45:21.000
this guy whose name is Steven Collins,

3638
01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:21.780
uh,

3639
01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.910
he played a pastor on this show,

3640
01:45:23.911 --> 01:45:24.744
seventh heaven.

3641
01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:30.140
He confessed to his estranged wife that he was a child molester and it's all on

3642
01:45:30.481 --> 01:45:31.680
tape apparently.

3643
01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:32.843
Um,

3644
01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:34.050
she recorded,

3645
01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.720
they were having meetings with the counselor and um,

3646
01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:43.010
she recorded him talking to this therapist and she was asking him all these

3647
01:45:44.881 --> 01:45:48.630
questions about these incidents and uh,

3648
01:45:48.690 --> 01:45:53.690
he was very specific about the answers and she taped the therapy session and

3649
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:59.030
apparently it's legal to secretly record a conversation because in California

3650
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:04.800
you're allowed to secretly record conversations to gather evidence that the

3651
01:46:04.801 --> 01:46:09.801
other person committed a violent felony and molesting a child under the age of

3652
01:46:10.081 --> 01:46:13.290
14 is considered a violent felony.

3653
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:15.600
This is amazing stuff.

3654
01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:16.500
Um,

3655
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.333
they,

3656
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.360
there was a,

3657
01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:22.140
he confessed to molesting and 11 year old girl,

3658
01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.510
a relative of his first wife.

3659
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.430
That's so sick,

3660
01:46:26.431 --> 01:46:27.264
man.

3661
01:46:27.690 --> 01:46:28.350
He,

3662
01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:28.700
I mean,

3663
01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.670
he's talking in,

3664
01:46:29.671 --> 01:46:30.504
in,

3665
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.360
in great detail about these things.

3666
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.690
Uh,

3667
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:34.040
he,

3668
01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.430
he did it a few times.

3669
01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.350
This one girl when she was 11,

3670
01:46:37.351 --> 01:46:39.360
12 or 13,

3671
01:46:41.370 --> 01:46:43.260
and this guy,

3672
01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:44.481
I mean,

3673
01:46:44.481 --> 01:46:46.290
he was playing a pastor.

3674
01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:47.091
This is,

3675
01:46:47.091 --> 01:46:47.360
uh,

3676
01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:47.660
I,

3677
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.150
it's,

3678
01:46:48.150 --> 01:46:49.210
it's really sick.

3679
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.281
<v 2>Well,</v>

3680
01:46:50.281 --> 01:46:50.461
what's,

3681
01:46:50.461 --> 01:46:54.060
what's crazy is that I have on my acting real,

3682
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:57.030
there's a scene with him and I doing the scenes,

3683
01:46:57.031 --> 01:46:58.200
one of the best things I ever did.

3684
01:46:58.201 --> 01:47:01.800
And it's really weird because I knew him really well.

3685
01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:02.850
I know him very well.

3686
01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:04.043
And

3687
01:47:05.690 --> 01:47:06.120
you know,

3688
01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.140
usually when you read about this,

3689
01:47:07.141 --> 01:47:07.321
you go,

3690
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:07.890
well that guy,

3691
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:08.490
that guy's,

3692
01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:10.560
that guy should be put in jail right away and all that stuff.

3693
01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:13.890
And it's an interesting thing because I've been thinking about it like,

3694
01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.330
I feel like,

3695
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:18.480
and I want to be careful how I say this because I know him well.

3696
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:19.651
I feel like this is,

3697
01:47:19.651 --> 01:47:19.830
uh,

3698
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:20.221
this is,

3699
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:20.730
uh,

3700
01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:24.030
a guy who's a good guy with a sickness,

3701
01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:24.990
like a,

3702
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.950
like a compulsion,

3703
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:26.611
a sickness.

3704
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:27.540
So when you say good guy,

3705
01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:28.710
I think that,

3706
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:30.323
I think that,

3707
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:31.950
I don't know man.

3708
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:32.910
I just,

3709
01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:34.980
I find myself shaking my head and scratching my head,

3710
01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:37.620
but I know Steven well and I think,

3711
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:40.080
I think it's possible.

3712
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.720
Is it possible that you are you,

3713
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.670
you mean good to everybody,

3714
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.840
your fellow man.

3715
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:49.890
Yet you have a compulsion and a sickness that you don't know what to do about.

3716
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.550
And this article that I was reading to you about in a,

3717
01:47:52.630 --> 01:47:55.680
we were on the plane and there was an article in New York Times written about

3718
01:47:55.730 --> 01:47:59.340
pedophilia and how a lot of pedophiles have these urges.

3719
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:00.780
They don't act on them.

3720
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.220
They live in fear.

3721
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:03.930
They have no control sometimes.

3722
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:05.820
And this woman was saying,

3723
01:48:05.821 --> 01:48:07.050
if those people,

3724
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:08.880
because all of us want to punish somebody like that,

3725
01:48:08.881 --> 01:48:09.040
right?

3726
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:09.890
The minute we see that guy,

3727
01:48:09.891 --> 01:48:10.321
I have daughter,

3728
01:48:10.321 --> 01:48:10.740
you have daughters.

3729
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:10.981
It's like,

3730
01:48:10.981 --> 01:48:12.300
I don't want that guy on the street.

3731
01:48:12.301 --> 01:48:13.170
I don't want to go onto your kids.

3732
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:15.660
We understand that and we all go,

3733
01:48:15.661 --> 01:48:16.770
we've got to get that guy in jail,

3734
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.890
but there's a bigger question to say and that is this.

3735
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:21.600
If you have these feelings,

3736
01:48:21.601 --> 01:48:23.550
you're a pedophile and you have these feelings,

3737
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:28.700
you just have these urges is shouldn't there be somewhere for these people to go

3738
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:30.263
where they can,

3739
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.171
where they can say,

3740
01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.190
I'm having these feelings.

3741
01:48:32.191 --> 01:48:35.040
I need help because I feel like I'm going to touch a child.

3742
01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:40.340
That seems to be creating a place for those people to go and somehow seek help,

3743
01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.000
I feel is more important.

3744
01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:46.950
Then if they,

3745
01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:47.311
if they,

3746
01:48:47.311 --> 01:48:47.701
if they,

3747
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:50.490
if they don't have anywhere to go to for help and they know that they go

3748
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:51.150
anywhere,

3749
01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:53.220
they're going to lose their jobs and lose their life and everything else,

3750
01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:54.301
they're not going to go anywhere.

3751
01:48:54.301 --> 01:48:55.170
They're going to touch a kid.

3752
01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:58.500
It's at the end results here is we have to figure out a way so less kids get,

3753
01:48:58.590 --> 01:48:58.930
you know,

3754
01:48:58.930 --> 01:48:59.491
molested.

3755
01:48:59.491 --> 01:48:59.850
Right,

3756
01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:00.683
right.

3757
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:03.840
It raises a very difficult debate and question,

3758
01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:07.830
which is if this is indeed a sickness and there's a lot of evidence that may be,

3759
01:49:07.831 --> 01:49:09.150
it is even neurological,

3760
01:49:09.151 --> 01:49:12.150
like there's an overwhelming number of pedophiles that are lefthanded and

3761
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:16.110
overwhelming number of pedophiles that have trouble with spacial relationships.

3762
01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:18.480
Was that in the New York Times article that you were reading on the plane?

3763
01:49:18.481 --> 01:49:18.751
Yes.

3764
01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:19.110
For that.

3765
01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:20.040
So fascinating.

3766
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:21.060
This came out today.

3767
01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:21.870
Yeah.

3768
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:24.330
And then here's this friend of mine who I really,

3769
01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:25.290
really like.

3770
01:49:25.291 --> 01:49:26.124
I mean he's a,

3771
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:27.930
he's just funny and the,

3772
01:49:27.931 --> 01:49:29.820
and does a lot of work for charities?

3773
01:49:29.821 --> 01:49:30.840
Got Kids of his own.

3774
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:31.051
Well,

3775
01:49:31.051 --> 01:49:32.820
apparently it wasn't just one instance.

3776
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.713
No,

3777
01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:39.260
LAPD is reopening an investigation from 2012 where his niece of a neighbor.

3778
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:41.761
Yeah.

3779
01:49:41.761 --> 01:49:42.594
And he went,

3780
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:45.450
I guess he admitted it to his wife and then he went to counseling,

3781
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.010
which I talked about it while you went in the bathroom and it was

3782
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.840
<v 3>all recorded by his wife and the recording is legal because he was uh,</v>

3783
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.260
doing a violent crime.

3784
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:54.150
It's awful.

3785
01:49:54.690 --> 01:49:55.520
It's really awful.

3786
01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:56.210
<v 2>Oh Man.</v>

3787
01:49:56.210 --> 01:49:56.720
I Dunno.

3788
01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.320
I'm just,

3789
01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.190
I'm shaking my head.

3790
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:59.683
I don't know,

3791
01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.060
but I do think that it,

3792
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.251
oh,

3793
01:50:01.251 --> 01:50:04.730
it is a very important debate to have is that if it's considered,

3794
01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:05.870
if it's a mental,

3795
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:08.840
a form of

3796
01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.630
a mental illness,

3797
01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.390
should they have somewhere to go to say,

3798
01:50:14.391 --> 01:50:14.661
Hey,

3799
01:50:14.661 --> 01:50:15.710
I have these urges.

3800
01:50:15.711 --> 01:50:16.580
I don't want to touch kid.

3801
01:50:16.581 --> 01:50:17.480
Please help me.

3802
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:22.820
It should there be a safe haven for pedophiles to get help so they don't touch

3803
01:50:22.821 --> 01:50:26.260
children or at least it lowers the chances that they will tell to touch on them.

3804
01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:27.800
That's the difficult question to ask.

3805
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:28.291
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

3806
01:50:28.291 --> 01:50:28.531
it's,

3807
01:50:28.531 --> 01:50:29.880
it's some scary shit,

3808
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:30.211
you know,

3809
01:50:30.211 --> 01:50:34.860
to think that you could be a person that is in all other ways a normal person,

3810
01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:39.861
but like a crack head around crack compelled like you,

3811
01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.310
you have an alcoholic.

3812
01:50:41.311 --> 01:50:44.490
Can you set a glass of whiskey in front of them and you pour a glass of whiskey?

3813
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:46.860
I mean they are drawn to that whiskey.

3814
01:50:46.861 --> 01:50:48.120
It's like a sickness,

3815
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:51.450
but that whiskey is not hurting anybody other than themselves.

3816
01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:55.590
When you see someone who's a pedophile and they're drawn to children,

3817
01:50:56.070 --> 01:51:00.480
we tend to lose all of our sympathy and all of our understanding.

3818
01:51:00.690 --> 01:51:03.870
And it's because we want to protect our people.

3819
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.131
You know,

3820
01:51:04.131 --> 01:51:06.090
we want to protect our family children.

3821
01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.650
But could you imagine,

3822
01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:08.100
I mean,

3823
01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:10.470
I'm not being sympathetic towards child molesters.

3824
01:51:10.471 --> 01:51:10.741
I mean,

3825
01:51:10.741 --> 01:51:11.311
believe me,

3826
01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:13.110
I'm the least sympathetic.

3827
01:51:13.111 --> 01:51:17.220
I have a very primal urge to break his fucking head open with a rock.

3828
01:51:17.250 --> 01:51:18.083
Right?

3829
01:51:18.150 --> 01:51:20.430
But imagine being this poor fuck.

3830
01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:20.761
I mean,

3831
01:51:20.761 --> 01:51:25.200
what is it about him that makes him want to go to this 11 year old girl and put

3832
01:51:25.201 --> 01:51:26.130
her hand on his chick?

3833
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:28.831
<v 2>It's fucked.</v>

3834
01:51:28.831 --> 01:51:30.240
But that was on that show for two years.

3835
01:51:30.241 --> 01:51:30.840
I worked with him.

3836
01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.530
What was the premise of the show was an American family.

3837
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:36.170
Like they basically,

3838
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:39.640
the premise was this is the perfect family and they're an example for everyone.

3839
01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:41.300
And he was a minister and the father and he had,

3840
01:51:41.610 --> 01:51:43.740
he had a wife and children.

3841
01:51:44.490 --> 01:51:44.881
Uh,

3842
01:51:44.881 --> 01:51:45.421
and,

3843
01:51:45.421 --> 01:51:46.254
uh,

3844
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.460
and I played this,

3845
01:51:47.461 --> 01:51:48.000
I remember I,

3846
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.450
my first scene I played this alcoholic comes back in this kid Peter's life and

3847
01:51:51.451 --> 01:51:52.860
he counsels me,

3848
01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:53.761
you know,

3849
01:51:53.761 --> 01:51:54.241
I'm a real,

3850
01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:56.670
a whole and he counsels me and you know,

3851
01:51:56.671 --> 01:51:57.051
and,

3852
01:51:57.051 --> 01:52:00.240
and I really got to know him because we had so many scenes together and spend a

3853
01:52:00.241 --> 01:52:00.690
lot of time,

3854
01:52:00.690 --> 01:52:01.760
did a reading forum,

3855
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.920
I've talked to him on the phone about sag and all kinds of stuff.

3856
01:52:04.921 --> 01:52:06.090
And it's just fucking,

3857
01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:06.953
it's just,

3858
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.793
I dunno man.

3859
01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:09.300
So this is confirmed.

3860
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.830
I,

3861
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:11.190
you never would've thought that dude.

3862
01:52:11.610 --> 01:52:11.761
Like,

3863
01:52:11.761 --> 01:52:12.121
you know what I mean?

3864
01:52:12.121 --> 01:52:12.661
That's the other thing.

3865
01:52:12.661 --> 01:52:13.890
Like some people you go,

3866
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:14.631
there's no way I,

3867
01:52:14.631 --> 01:52:15.464
well of course that's a,

3868
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:19.230
that's a good person who I'd leave my kid with that,

3869
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.620
you know,

3870
01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:19.930
anyway,

3871
01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:20.281
I,

3872
01:52:20.281 --> 01:52:20.700
it's,

3873
01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.533
you just don't know.

3874
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.650
You don't know man.

3875
01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:24.960
You don't know what goes on the inner recesses of someone's brain.

3876
01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:26.371
But I do think,

3877
01:52:26.371 --> 01:52:27.750
I do think this is a case,

3878
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:29.100
if there's ever been one,

3879
01:52:29.101 --> 01:52:30.060
I don't know anything.

3880
01:52:30.090 --> 01:52:30.930
I'm not an expert,

3881
01:52:30.931 --> 01:52:32.850
but of of,

3882
01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:34.950
of a good person with a sickness,

3883
01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:35.790
you know,

3884
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:36.623
of a guy.

3885
01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:38.400
I Dunno.

3886
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:38.850
I Dunno.

3887
01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:39.330
I'm just,

3888
01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:39.721
I'm just,

3889
01:52:39.721 --> 01:52:40.740
I don't even know what to say about it.

3890
01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.233
<v 3>It's dark,</v>

3891
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.350
it's dark shit,

3892
01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:43.771
dark,

3893
01:52:43.771 --> 01:52:44.341
scary,

3894
01:52:44.341 --> 01:52:45.240
awful stuff.

3895
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:46.190
And then I started

3896
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:48.410
<v 1>thinking about other things that are really hard to even talk about.</v>

3897
01:52:48.411 --> 01:52:49.244
Like,

3898
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.230
like there's what is,

3899
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.870
and there's molestation of a child.

3900
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:55.910
We already know what it does.

3901
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:58.040
Most people the revulsion and what you want to do.

3902
01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:01.430
And then there are different levels of molestation that nobody really talks

3903
01:53:01.431 --> 01:53:03.380
about touching and then actual sex.

3904
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:04.663
Right.

3905
01:53:04.670 --> 01:53:06.530
And one I would imagine,

3906
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:09.110
and I have to believe is way more traumatic than the other.

3907
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:10.123
Yeah.

3908
01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:13.040
I don't know how the law sees it,

3909
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:14.330
but yeah,

3910
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:15.530
the guy's life is done.

3911
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.110
I think it's sexist sex.

3912
01:53:18.111 --> 01:53:18.351
I mean,

3913
01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:19.670
I think the law sees it.

3914
01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:22.310
Like if you're involving genitals and touching,

3915
01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.740
I mean it's one thing if there's sexual misconduct though,

3916
01:53:24.741 --> 01:53:25.760
and then there's a salt,

3917
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:26.481
right?

3918
01:53:26.481 --> 01:53:28.230
So one is penetration I think,

3919
01:53:28.231 --> 01:53:32.510
and the other calling this violence sex and that's the reason why she was

3920
01:53:32.511 --> 01:53:33.170
allowed.

3921
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:34.070
Or he rather,

3922
01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:34.310
uh,

3923
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:35.930
the woman rather his wife.

3924
01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:36.441
I was right.

3925
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:40.490
The first time she was allowed to record him in these counseling sessions is

3926
01:53:40.491 --> 01:53:41.870
because it's violent sex.

3927
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.180
But what is violence?

3928
01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.620
This where it's a violent crime,

3929
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:46.210
not violence,

3930
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.990
but it falls under the umbrella of violent crime.

3931
01:53:47.991 --> 01:53:48.650
Right?

3932
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:52.150
But what is violence isn't violent.

3933
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.990
I thought violence is like trauma.

3934
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.970
I thought violence is like aggression.

3935
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:56.550
If,

3936
01:53:56.550 --> 01:54:00.170
if someone takes your hand and gently puts it on their dick,

3937
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:01.440
it's awful.

3938
01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:01.760
Right?

3939
01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:02.150
Right.

3940
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:03.140
Obviously evil.

3941
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.090
But is that violent?

3942
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:09.110
Because if he's dating a woman and he takes his hand and,

3943
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.160
or it takes her hand and put,

3944
01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:11.150
puts it on his dick,

3945
01:54:11.151 --> 01:54:12.140
that's not violent.

3946
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:12.974
Right.

3947
01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.590
Or is it thought to be violent?

3948
01:54:15.591 --> 01:54:17.390
If she didn't want him to do that?

3949
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:18.743
Here's me.

3950
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.190
I mean she resists like,

3951
01:54:20.191 --> 01:54:21.024
so let's say,

3952
01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.130
let's say he's with a woman,

3953
01:54:22.131 --> 01:54:23.060
they'd go back to his place,

3954
01:54:23.061 --> 01:54:24.170
they're having a glass of wine,

3955
01:54:24.171 --> 01:54:26.050
they're just talking and he put,

3956
01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:29.240
takes her hand and he puts it on his Dick and you know,

3957
01:54:29.241 --> 01:54:32.610
and she resists and then he lets go.

3958
01:54:32.610 --> 01:54:33.443
It was that violent.

3959
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.771
Well,

3960
01:54:33.771 --> 01:54:38.270
what if he takes her hand and he puts it on his dick and she struggles the whole

3961
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:39.380
way that's violent.

3962
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:42.140
But if she doesn't resist at all and she just goes,

3963
01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:43.250
he was being inappropriate.

3964
01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:44.170
I saw assuming.

3965
01:54:44.171 --> 01:54:44.260
Yeah.

3966
01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:44.480
What,

3967
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:45.920
what is violent?

3968
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.790
I mean it will,

3969
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:47.550
the word violence,

3970
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:48.081
weird word.

3971
01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:51.680
I mean I guess we're kind of having a conversation about semantic.

3972
01:54:51.681 --> 01:54:51.921
No,

3973
01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:52.431
you're not.

3974
01:54:52.431 --> 01:54:53.600
You have to have no,

3975
01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.670
but why violence?

3976
01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:55.670
But because first of all,

3977
01:54:55.671 --> 01:54:58.490
I think there is a difference between anal rape and,

3978
01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.070
Oh yeah.

3979
01:54:59.070 --> 01:55:00.740
Vaginal rape and being touched.

3980
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:01.520
I was,

3981
01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.690
when I was a kid in camp,

3982
01:55:02.691 --> 01:55:04.130
I was 11 I was,

3983
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:08.630
I guess technically molested by my camp counselor who was an old man in his

3984
01:55:08.631 --> 01:55:11.240
forties and he was touching me and funneling me.

3985
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:13.610
I woke up and he had his hand in my pants and he was playing with my,

3986
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.090
my,

3987
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.481
you know,

3988
01:55:14.481 --> 01:55:15.314
my piece,

3989
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.693
my gack.

3990
01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:17.720
And I remember going,

3991
01:55:17.721 --> 01:55:19.010
I remember being 11 gone.

3992
01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.360
This is weird man.

3993
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:23.540
He's got a beard and he smells weird and he's touching my wiener.

3994
01:55:23.541 --> 01:55:24.530
I don't think this makes sense.

3995
01:55:24.531 --> 01:55:26.180
So other than I'd tell my friend John and Donnie,

3996
01:55:26.181 --> 01:55:26.630
I go,

3997
01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:27.410
hey,

3998
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.681
did,

3999
01:55:27.681 --> 01:55:29.150
did he touch you down there?

4000
01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:30.200
And my friend done?

4001
01:55:30.201 --> 01:55:30.471
He goes,

4002
01:55:30.471 --> 01:55:31.011
yeah,

4003
01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:34.760
he sucked me down there and then my buddy John Goes,

4004
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.140
he touched me too,

4005
01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:37.273
so I go,

4006
01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.770
I'm going to tell my mom and I marched,

4007
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.710
but my mother was coming for parent weekend was I was away at camp.

4008
01:55:42.711 --> 01:55:44.370
My mother and I went right up to it.

4009
01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:44.760
I go,

4010
01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:45.330
Hey,

4011
01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:47.610
that guy touched mine big.

4012
01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.300
He sucked on his dick and he touched Johnson and my mind went right to the

4013
01:55:51.301 --> 01:55:52.440
camera and the guy back then,

4014
01:55:52.441 --> 01:55:53.790
this was probably,

4015
01:55:53.791 --> 01:55:54.090
I dunno,

4016
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:54.661
what was it,

4017
01:55:54.661 --> 01:55:56.130
1978 or whatever.

4018
01:55:56.250 --> 01:55:58.020
He got fired and just send on his way.

4019
01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:58.890
There was no criminal thing.

4020
01:55:58.920 --> 01:55:59.101
Yeah,

4021
01:55:59.101 --> 01:55:59.281
it was,

4022
01:55:59.281 --> 01:56:00.114
it said on the way.

4023
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:02.490
And when they told his wife he was married,

4024
01:56:02.491 --> 01:56:03.720
when he told his wife,

4025
01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:05.910
his wife laughed and said,

4026
01:56:05.911 --> 01:56:06.601
Oh God,

4027
01:56:06.601 --> 01:56:07.560
he's up to that again.

4028
01:56:08.230 --> 01:56:08.610
Yes.

4029
01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:09.660
And My mother told me that.

4030
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.820
Oh my God.

4031
01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:12.330
Yeah.

4032
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:13.710
His wife laugh.

4033
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.490
Yes,

4034
01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:15.990
and said he's up to that.

4035
01:56:15.991 --> 01:56:16.650
Yes.

4036
01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:17.280
Yes.

4037
01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.840
She was the arts and craft counselor.

4038
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:20.520
She had shorter anyway.

4039
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:21.210
But listen,

4040
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:26.210
it's strange how much our attitudes about those types of changes have changed

4041
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.001
really,

4042
01:56:27.001 --> 01:56:28.290
really radically.

4043
01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:28.561
Well,

4044
01:56:28.561 --> 01:56:29.490
I think because we,

4045
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:32.700
people are more open to talk about it and talk about the damage it did when they

4046
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:33.534
were kids.

4047
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.600
And I think the point I'm raising is that it all depends on the circumstances,

4048
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.500
the level of molestation and what kind.

4049
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:42.990
I don't think that damaged me,

4050
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:45.270
but I can't speak for this girl.

4051
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:45.661
Look at me.

4052
01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:46.494
I'm a mess.

4053
01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.540
I'm a mess from that one.

4054
01:56:49.570 --> 01:56:52.860
Mamike a beard and a hand on the Dick.

4055
01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:57.870
But you do have to have that conversation about levels of degree.

4056
01:56:57.871 --> 01:56:59.490
Because if you don't,

4057
01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:02.820
then it's not fair to people who are really raped and you know,

4058
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:05.940
I mean who are vaginally and Ainsley and all that other stuff.

4059
01:57:05.941 --> 01:57:06.761
There's a difference.

4060
01:57:06.761 --> 01:57:06.841
Well,

4061
01:57:06.841 --> 01:57:09.540
that's why this whole yes means yes.

4062
01:57:09.541 --> 01:57:09.841
Law,

4063
01:57:09.841 --> 01:57:11.580
which was recently passed in California,

4064
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:14.820
is it's kind of offensive to people that have actually been raped.

4065
01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:16.440
If you don't know this law,

4066
01:57:16.441 --> 01:57:21.441
the idea being that a lack of resistance does not equal consent and you must get

4067
01:57:23.011 --> 01:57:23.844
consent.

4068
01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:26.400
And so if someone's taken all the romance out of sex,

4069
01:57:26.401 --> 01:57:27.610
by the way holds,

4070
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:28.950
it's crazy,

4071
01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:29.610
but,

4072
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:33.780
but I guess I kind of see why they're doing it.

4073
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:37.950
I kind of see that they don't want someone to feel like they were overwhelmed by

4074
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:40.050
someone and they didn't know what to do and they couldn't say anything.

4075
01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:43.140
And so they think that by forcing people to say,

4076
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.621
yes,

4077
01:57:43.621 --> 01:57:46.380
I want to have sex with you that this would,

4078
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:49.920
but then it's also feminists want to be able to withdraw consent after the fact

4079
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.390
if they feel like they were tricked.

4080
01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:53.040
So they want to be able to cry.

4081
01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:55.410
Rape if you manipulated and lied to them.

4082
01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:55.891
Like I said,

4083
01:57:55.891 --> 01:57:56.461
I love you,

4084
01:57:56.461 --> 01:57:57.840
make love to me and they have sex.

4085
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.890
I don't love you.

4086
01:57:58.891 --> 01:58:00.030
You fucking kidding me.

4087
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:00.271
No,

4088
01:58:00.271 --> 01:58:00.960
I'm not.

4089
01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:01.111
No,

4090
01:58:01.111 --> 01:58:01.441
that's,

4091
01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:04.830
that's a real tenant of some forms of radical feminism.

4092
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:05.100
They,

4093
01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:07.260
they want to be able to withdraw consent after the fact.

4094
01:58:07.261 --> 01:58:07.381
Well,

4095
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:09.060
those Luna can say what they want,

4096
01:58:09.061 --> 01:58:09.661
but here's what I,

4097
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:12.840
this is why I think that's lunacy and why I think it's so insulting.

4098
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:14.010
If you're gang raped,

4099
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:15.690
you're held down by a stranger APP.

4100
01:58:15.691 --> 01:58:17.970
Now there's a couple apps for the iPhone.

4101
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.581
Uh,

4102
01:58:18.581 --> 01:58:20.010
there's one called good to go.

4103
01:58:20.011 --> 01:58:20.251
What does,

4104
01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:21.510
this one's good to go?

4105
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.360
Yeah.

4106
01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.190
You like,

4107
01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:25.800
I don't even know if it does it work on fingerprints or something like that?

4108
01:58:25.801 --> 01:58:26.634
What does it work on?

4109
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:27.520
Fingerprint.

4110
01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:27.691
Yeah.

4111
01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:32.010
Some of them work on fingerprints grow and you have an app and I have an APP and

4112
01:58:32.011 --> 01:58:34.840
you click yes and I click yes and fuck,

4113
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:35.803
what are we doing?

4114
01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:36.420
You know,

4115
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:37.253
that's that,

4116
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:39.540
that's fucking lunacy in my opinion.

4117
01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:42.040
And I think it's a real insult to people who have been

4118
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.150
<v 3>held down and raped by strangers or,</v>

4119
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:44.580
or of,

4120
01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:46.150
they know in a violent manner.

4121
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:47.343
You know,

4122
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:48.430
it's,

4123
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:49.001
there are,

4124
01:58:49.001 --> 01:58:51.580
I do think that there are times when somebody can be,

4125
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:52.940
you know,

4126
01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.450
that a woman is so overwhelmed,

4127
01:58:54.451 --> 01:58:54.640
she yet,

4128
01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:56.140
she doesn't know what to say and she gets raped.

4129
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:56.801
I'm not a woman.

4130
01:58:56.801 --> 01:58:57.850
I don't know what the fuck goes on.

4131
01:58:57.851 --> 01:58:58.450
Okay.

4132
01:58:58.450 --> 01:58:59.380
And there's 100%.

4133
01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:01.690
I understand that there's date rape and all that stuff.

4134
01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:05.290
There's also times where you really wish you said no and you don't like when

4135
01:59:05.291 --> 01:59:08.560
it's happening and you don't know what to do and you just sit there and a guy

4136
01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:09.340
has sex with you.

4137
01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:10.000
Yes,

4138
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.680
but I don't know what that is.

4139
01:59:11.681 --> 01:59:13.000
Is that sexual assault?

4140
01:59:13.410 --> 01:59:14.710
How was the man's supposed to know?

4141
01:59:14.711 --> 01:59:15.700
If you don't say anything,

4142
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:16.210
there's,

4143
01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:19.540
there's that and if you do say something and the man continues,

4144
01:59:19.541 --> 01:59:20.410
well that's rape,

4145
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.160
right?

4146
01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:21.761
If he say,

4147
01:59:21.761 --> 01:59:22.610
please stop.

4148
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.261
You know,

4149
01:59:23.261 --> 01:59:24.220
don't take my pants off.

4150
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:25.054
Don't have sex with me,

4151
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:26.050
and the guy does it anyway.

4152
01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.760
We'll both agree that's right.

4153
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:28.270
Yes.

4154
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:29.920
So w but then there's a problem.

4155
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:32.770
They're trying to say that if you're consuming alcohol.

4156
01:59:32.771 --> 01:59:34.390
I had Thaddeus Russell and podcast.

4157
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:34.990
Okay.

4158
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:37.780
He's a professor at Occidental,

4159
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.441
Occidental College or university.

4160
01:59:38.441 --> 01:59:39.161
We never figured it out.

4161
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:39.994
It's called the college.

4162
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.660
Okay.

4163
01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:44.260
He was a professor at this college where these two kids,

4164
01:59:44.261 --> 01:59:45.220
they were both freshmen.

4165
01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:46.240
They were both young.

4166
01:59:46.450 --> 01:59:47.500
They got drunk,

4167
01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:48.550
they had sex,

4168
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:52.780
and the girl decided that it was rape because she was drunk when they had sex.

4169
01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:55.390
Meanwhile on her text messages,

4170
01:59:55.391 --> 01:59:57.550
she's sending a text message to her friend.

4171
01:59:58.050 --> 01:59:58.510
Um,

4172
01:59:58.510 --> 02:00:00.070
she sent a text message to him.

4173
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:00.641
He's saying,

4174
02:00:00.641 --> 02:00:01.301
come over here.

4175
02:00:01.301 --> 02:00:01.811
She says,

4176
02:00:01.811 --> 02:00:02.644
do you have a condom?

4177
02:00:02.650 --> 02:00:03.191
He says,

4178
02:00:03.191 --> 02:00:03.820
yes.

4179
02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:04.990
She texts her friend,

4180
02:00:04.991 --> 02:00:06.190
I'm about to go have sex.

4181
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:07.420
She went over to his house.

4182
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:12.190
She had sex with them and then afterwards the college decided that this was rape

4183
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:14.020
because she was intoxicated,

4184
02:00:14.230 --> 02:00:15.640
but he was intoxicated too.

4185
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:17.050
They're both intoxicated.

4186
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:18.880
They're communicating back and forth to each other,

4187
02:00:18.881 --> 02:00:21.790
but somehow or another he's responsible for his actions.

4188
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.530
He was expelled from college.

4189
02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:24.281
She wasn't.

4190
02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:26.620
It sounds like it like people who hate men,

4191
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.390
it's feminism.

4192
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:27.790
Yeah.

4193
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:31.090
That's a big part of what some feminism is.

4194
02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:32.050
Not all feminism.

4195
02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.570
A lot of feminism is just striving for equality.

4196
02:00:34.571 --> 02:00:34.811
Yeah.

4197
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:35.060
I'm a,

4198
02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.250
I'm a feminist international.

4199
02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:36.761
Yes.

4200
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:37.480
In that sense.

4201
02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:37.840
Yeah,

4202
02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:41.620
but the real problem is one of the women at Occidental College that fattiest

4203
02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:44.010
Russell referenced who co counsel this.

4204
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:48.010
This girl said that he fits the profile ready for this,

4205
02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:51.610
for being a rapist because he came from a good family because he's a

4206
02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.800
Valedictorian and because he's on a sports team.

4207
02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:55.390
Wow.

4208
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:56.110
Wow,

4209
02:00:56.110 --> 02:00:56.600
wow.

4210
02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:57.170
Terrifying.

4211
02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:58.360
He an under achiever I guess.

4212
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:01.300
And then you won't be a rate how terrified he said that he's privileged because

4213
02:01:01.301 --> 02:01:03.760
it comes from a good family that he's on a sports team.

4214
02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:05.650
So he embraces the jock culture of,

4215
02:01:05.651 --> 02:01:05.861
of,

4216
02:01:05.861 --> 02:01:08.410
of sexual assault and shocks don't,

4217
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:09.670
but whatever,

4218
02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:10.181
you know,

4219
02:01:10.181 --> 02:01:11.560
and that he's a Valedictorian.

4220
02:01:11.561 --> 02:01:12.820
So because he's successful,

4221
02:01:12.821 --> 02:01:14.980
he's got this like drive to succeed,

4222
02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.750
which could lead him to being a rapist.

4223
02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:19.630
What the fuck got expelled?

4224
02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.493
He got expelled,

4225
02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:22.030
we suing and there's a big lawsuit.

4226
02:01:22.031 --> 02:01:22.660
But look,

4227
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.340
his life is changed.

4228
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:25.450
Her life has changed.

4229
02:01:25.451 --> 02:01:27.220
Both their lives are changed and it's what happened.

4230
02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:28.810
They got trunk and they fucked man.

4231
02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:29.651
And that is,

4232
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:32.380
Russell had a really good point that I've always said is that one of the

4233
02:01:32.381 --> 02:01:37.381
problems with women and sex is that we have this idea still in our heads.

4234
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.250
A lot of people do that.

4235
02:01:40.251 --> 02:01:41.570
Sex is a bad thing.

4236
02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.970
And that a man having sex with a girl at the girls,

4237
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:46.430
he's done something to her taking something from her.

4238
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:50.000
And a lot of it comes from a bunch of fucking idiots that think that a woman

4239
02:01:50.001 --> 02:01:51.800
having sex with a man is a bad thing.

4240
02:01:51.801 --> 02:01:53.210
So she gets shamed for it.

4241
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.040
So she feels bad for being shamed,

4242
02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:55.874
for having sex.

4243
02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:00.880
And so she equates that with her having been a like a crime's been committed on

4244
02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:04.190
her because people will make you feel bad because you,

4245
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:05.600
you owe that guy fucked you.

4246
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:06.500
Oh you loser.

4247
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:07.221
Like no,

4248
02:02:07.221 --> 02:02:07.430
no,

4249
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:08.211
you had sex,

4250
02:02:08.211 --> 02:02:08.841
you're normal,

4251
02:02:08.841 --> 02:02:09.680
you're alive,

4252
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:10.521
you're a person,

4253
02:02:10.521 --> 02:02:11.121
you have hormones.

4254
02:02:11.121 --> 02:02:12.050
It feels good.

4255
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.490
You did it cause you wanted to do it.

4256
02:02:13.491 --> 02:02:14.450
And men and women do it.

4257
02:02:14.690 --> 02:02:18.350
And our puritan values and are ridiculous notions,

4258
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:23.660
completely unequal that a woman can have sexual experiences with a guy and more

4259
02:02:23.661 --> 02:02:25.700
than one man and she's a fucking slut.

4260
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:26.870
But if a guy does it,

4261
02:02:26.871 --> 02:02:27.704
he's a stud.

4262
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.300
It's stupid,

4263
02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.261
it's stupid.

4264
02:02:30.261 --> 02:02:32.840
And it's all based on pure it and values.

4265
02:02:32.841 --> 02:02:33.351
And it's a lot of,

4266
02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:36.650
it's based on the time before birth control and disease.

4267
02:02:36.651 --> 02:02:37.790
When you didn't have antibiotics,

4268
02:02:37.791 --> 02:02:39.610
you had to be very careful he had sex with,

4269
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:40.670
but birth control,

4270
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:41.840
no Joe,

4271
02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.070
a woman having this,

4272
02:02:43.071 --> 02:02:46.970
these responsibilities that she has to worry about becoming impregnated.

4273
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:47.511
You know,

4274
02:02:47.511 --> 02:02:51.470
we're a guy can just fucking shoot loads all fucking willy nilly to the cows,

4275
02:02:51.471 --> 02:02:54.600
come home and not worry about a God damn thing happening to his body.

4276
02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:58.640
Celebrate a woman has to be concerned every time she has intercourse that she

4277
02:02:58.641 --> 02:03:00.380
might have to raise a child,

4278
02:03:00.381 --> 02:03:02.270
drop out of school or have an abortion.

4279
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:02.781
Those are those,

4280
02:03:02.781 --> 02:03:06.080
the the real cold hard facts and so this,

4281
02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:10.970
this ground is very uneven but now you add in birth control,

4282
02:03:10.971 --> 02:03:15.830
which is why a lot of people believe like one of the radical changes in society

4283
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:19.610
in this culture was in the 1950s when they invented,

4284
02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:20.960
or sixties when they invented Bert.

4285
02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.040
When did they invent birth control?

4286
02:03:22.041 --> 02:03:25.700
Fifties or sixties one of those is the sixth massive change,

4287
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:28.640
massive change in the way human beings interacted,

4288
02:03:28.641 --> 02:03:29.540
males and females,

4289
02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.150
because all of a sudden the women's liberation movement happened.

4290
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:37.310
Women were allowed to have sex and not worry about constantly having to worry

4291
02:03:37.311 --> 02:03:40.130
about being pregnant and having babies with these dudes.

4292
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.401
Well,

4293
02:03:40.401 --> 02:03:41.450
they just wanted to fuck.

4294
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:45.350
They're just young people wanting to live their life and wanted to do what their

4295
02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:48.020
hormones we're telling them to do to enjoy it.

4296
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:52.730
It's one of the great fun things in life is a man and a woman having sex and the

4297
02:03:52.731 --> 02:03:56.630
this idea that two people having sex if they're drunk is rape.

4298
02:03:57.050 --> 02:04:00.590
The problem with it is it's only rape for the girl.

4299
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.670
It's not raped for the guy and no one is ever going to argue that if a guy and a

4300
02:04:04.671 --> 02:04:07.910
girl get together and they have a couple of drinks and the girl gets on top of

4301
02:04:07.911 --> 02:04:09.050
the guy and has sex with them,

4302
02:04:09.170 --> 02:04:10.160
that the guy got raped,

4303
02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:13.460
no one is ever going to argue that you can't take it to court,

4304
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:14.900
you'll be laughed out of court.

4305
02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.990
So that's really unfair and really uneven.

4306
02:04:17.991 --> 02:04:22.991
And it's a response to the really unfair and really uneven views that we have

4307
02:04:23.331 --> 02:04:24.980
about men and women and their sexuality.

4308
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.690
So you may,

4309
02:04:25.690 --> 02:04:27.200
right now we're seeing a pendulum,

4310
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:30.230
we're seeing the high end of the pendulum and we're going to come back and eat.

4311
02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:30.590
Yeah,

4312
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:30.931
well we're,

4313
02:04:30.931 --> 02:04:32.390
we're seeing a reaction.

4314
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:32.721
I mean,

4315
02:04:32.721 --> 02:04:36.110
we're seeing reaction to the sex that's been marginalized,

4316
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:37.480
that females have been marginalized,

4317
02:04:37.481 --> 02:04:38.260
that they had been oppressed.

4318
02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:38.910
<v 1>And then look,</v>

4319
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:40.740
rape is fucking real as shit man.

4320
02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:43.710
Like we were in Alaska and one of the things that we talked about where we're in

4321
02:04:43.711 --> 02:04:48.150
Alaska with people that live there is how many people get raped up there and

4322
02:04:48.151 --> 02:04:48.984
that these women,

4323
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:50.580
women who live in Alaska,

4324
02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:52.470
you're dealing with high rates of alcoholism.

4325
02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:56.130
You're dealing with isolated populations and you're dealing with a lot of rape.

4326
02:04:56.190 --> 02:04:56.521
Well,

4327
02:04:56.521 --> 02:04:57.750
because there are few women,

4328
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:00.300
very few moments need to to men and something crazy,

4329
02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:02.700
like seven to one crazy men to one woman.

4330
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:03.180
Yeah.

4331
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:03.871
So let girls,

4332
02:05:03.871 --> 02:05:04.650
if you look at for Dick,

4333
02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:04.921
oh,

4334
02:05:04.921 --> 02:05:05.610
Asca,

4335
02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:06.443
Alaska,

4336
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:08.160
a lot of rugged men.

4337
02:05:08.190 --> 02:05:11.310
But did you ever see they have those posters like the men of old calendars,

4338
02:05:11.311 --> 02:05:12.240
these to sell the Gals,

4339
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.880
the men of Alaska and dude's fucking cowboy hats,

4340
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:15.803
giant dogs.

4341
02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.120
Then they would have fly fishing pole.

4342
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:20.940
I like to fish and fuck.

4343
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:21.201
Yeah.

4344
02:05:21.201 --> 02:05:23.550
That's a funny thing about pornography when it comes to women,

4345
02:05:23.551 --> 02:05:26.460
like some women enjoy watching men and women have sex,

4346
02:05:26.461 --> 02:05:31.050
but very few women like playgirl like playgirl and looking at you guys' Cox.

4347
02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:31.650
Yeah,

4348
02:05:31.650 --> 02:05:32.490
that's for dudes.

4349
02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:32.811
Yeah.

4350
02:05:32.811 --> 02:05:33.360
Okay.

4351
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:33.660
Yeah.

4352
02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.110
Playgirl is for fucking dudes.

4353
02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.800
If you're a guy and you post for playgirl,

4354
02:05:37.801 --> 02:05:38.940
you're doing gay porn.

4355
02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:39.953
Sorry.

4356
02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:41.100
I know you don't want to think.

4357
02:05:41.101 --> 02:05:41.301
No,

4358
02:05:41.301 --> 02:05:41.510
no,

4359
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.760
no.

4360
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.270
Bro.

4361
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:46.500
Beth that can girls who liberated man watching more and more women apparently

4362
02:05:46.501 --> 02:05:47.334
are watching porn.

4363
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:47.611
Dude,

4364
02:05:47.611 --> 02:05:49.350
I w I looked at one playgirl once,

4365
02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.200
once just once,

4366
02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:54.720
gun to my head and a guy was like doing like,

4367
02:05:54.721 --> 02:05:56.940
what's that baby happy baby position?

4368
02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:58.710
You're lying down,

4369
02:05:58.711 --> 02:05:59.261
your feet are,

4370
02:05:59.261 --> 02:06:00.380
and he was holding down the legs,

4371
02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:00.851
ankles.

4372
02:06:00.851 --> 02:06:04.590
He was holding his feet and his fucking cock was like three quarters hard

4373
02:06:04.710 --> 02:06:06.420
because you're not allowed to show hard cocks.

4374
02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:09.630
And those magazines because hard Cox is hardcore pornography.

4375
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:11.011
Very strange.

4376
02:06:11.011 --> 02:06:13.680
Softix when I was a kid porn,

4377
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.420
you weren't allowed to show hard ons.

4378
02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:18.540
You had to show like semis only semis.

4379
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:20.190
It was very strange.

4380
02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:24.180
So like all porn scenes where guys like they were making pastries,

4381
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:26.320
they're all like squeezing the base of their Dick.

4382
02:06:26.321 --> 02:06:28.450
Like they were trying to write happy birthday with a cock.

4383
02:06:30.070 --> 02:06:30.720
That was,

4384
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.880
that was all porn.

4385
02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:32.461
That was all,

4386
02:06:32.461 --> 02:06:33.600
all magazines.

4387
02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.000
There was no like penetration in magazines.

4388
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.160
So all you got red tube and x,

4389
02:06:38.161 --> 02:06:40.000
x and x and all of that show.

4390
02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:40.320
It's,

4391
02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.320
it's changed like our or ability to view sex has changed so radically that

4392
02:06:46.771 --> 02:06:47.760
people apparently,

4393
02:06:47.761 --> 02:06:51.480
especially kids are engaging in way more sex,

4394
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:56.340
way more sex early and also the kind of sex that watch on TV cause they think a

4395
02:06:56.341 --> 02:06:57.730
lot of the women think they have to go.

4396
02:06:57.750 --> 02:07:01.500
Girls think they have to keep up with the boys fantasies because they've been

4397
02:07:01.501 --> 02:07:04.530
watching all this porn and boys get really bored too.

4398
02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.310
Apparently the,

4399
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:05.850
and I've heard,

4400
02:07:05.850 --> 02:07:09.750
I've read studies or heard about studies where a lot of boys will,

4401
02:07:09.790 --> 02:07:10.530
um,

4402
02:07:10.530 --> 02:07:12.780
like when you and I were growing up just seeing a naked girl,

4403
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:14.000
we weren't looking at imperfections.

4404
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:14.341
We were like,

4405
02:07:14.341 --> 02:07:15.600
holy fucking shit.

4406
02:07:15.601 --> 02:07:16.480
She's naked.

4407
02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:17.910
New.

4408
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:18.743
Yeah.

4409
02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:20.520
Now have access to,

4410
02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:21.330
you know,

4411
02:07:21.330 --> 02:07:25.860
these women that have been surgically enhanced and Photoshop and all that stuff.

4412
02:07:25.861 --> 02:07:27.020
And with makeup and,

4413
02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:27.870
and you know,

4414
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:28.710
they're linear,

4415
02:07:28.711 --> 02:07:32.700
they're I their appreciation for linear lines and you know,

4416
02:07:32.701 --> 02:07:35.530
all that stuff is way more height and they're way more picky.

4417
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:37.000
And so a lot of women,

4418
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:37.720
they'll kind of start,

4419
02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.390
they'll go with one girl and then they'll go to the next girl.

4420
02:07:40.391 --> 02:07:42.040
And there's a lot more of that apparently.

4421
02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:42.550
I don't know.

4422
02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:42.790
Yeah.

4423
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:43.601
Apparently it's,

4424
02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:44.434
it's,

4425
02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:46.300
it's amazing though that we,

4426
02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:51.070
we have all these weird hangups in this day and age when it comes to sex.

4427
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.230
And I think a lot of it has to be,

4428
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:58.231
because it's like sexual attraction is not an even thing.

4429
02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.290
I mean,

4430
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:02.980
have you ever been around a woman who was not sexually attractive,

4431
02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:05.530
but she has a friend who's sexually attractive?

4432
02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:07.580
There's a lot of the women who are nonsexual,

4433
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:08.051
attractive,

4434
02:08:08.051 --> 02:08:09.610
get fucking aggressive.

4435
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.260
They don't like men.

4436
02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:15.070
They tried to keep men away from their friend and they're trying to protect

4437
02:08:15.071 --> 02:08:15.940
their friend it,

4438
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:17.410
but under the guise,

4439
02:08:17.411 --> 02:08:19.390
but it's not their cock blockers.

4440
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:23.380
There are hardcore cock blockers because they're angry that they're not sexually

4441
02:08:23.381 --> 02:08:27.010
attractive in a lot of it is just a fucking genetic roll of the dice.

4442
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.960
Like you have perfect bone structure.

4443
02:08:29.050 --> 02:08:30.520
Your nose is the perfect shape,

4444
02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:33.430
your body's perfect shape and everybody's gravitating towards you.

4445
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:36.640
But you go to the person on the left and this person,

4446
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:37.180
they are,

4447
02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:37.481
you know,

4448
02:08:37.481 --> 02:08:38.580
the dad was goofy looking,

4449
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:40.390
their mom was goofy looking and you know,

4450
02:08:40.391 --> 02:08:42.190
and then they make goofy looking kids and it's just,

4451
02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:44.650
there's nothing that goofy looking kid can do about it.

4452
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:45.181
But when,

4453
02:08:45.181 --> 02:08:45.341
you know,

4454
02:08:45.341 --> 02:08:46.840
when you're talking about these,

4455
02:08:46.841 --> 02:08:50.500
these for radical feminists who are coming up with these laws or whatever they,

4456
02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:50.951
again,

4457
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:51.341
this is,

4458
02:08:51.341 --> 02:08:52.570
this is the lunatic fringe.

4459
02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:56.440
This is an example of we can bring them back to the t to the Islam debate,

4460
02:08:56.740 --> 02:08:57.370
you know?

4461
02:08:57.370 --> 02:08:57.830
Yeah.

4462
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:58.780
There are,

4463
02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:03.900
I believe that these people are unreasonable and there are a lot of people in

4464
02:09:04.241 --> 02:09:06.130
religion that are unreasonable.

4465
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:06.651
And,

4466
02:09:06.651 --> 02:09:10.120
and I think that that these feminists who are pushing these laws are very

4467
02:09:10.121 --> 02:09:12.010
similar to the two fundamentalists.

4468
02:09:12.011 --> 02:09:13.810
They are religious in their own way.

4469
02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.730
They had their own orthodoxy,

4470
02:09:15.731 --> 02:09:17.050
their own fundamentalism,

4471
02:09:17.051 --> 02:09:22.051
their own very strong ideas of what rape is and rape is anything,

4472
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:25.690
anything that they deem it to be in this,

4473
02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.610
in this case they put rape.

4474
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.330
They put,

4475
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:28.660
uh,

4476
02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:33.660
somebody who didn't necessarily say they want to have sex on the same ground as

4477
02:09:33.671 --> 02:09:37.150
somebody who was violently raped by some stranger in a parking lot at knife

4478
02:09:37.151 --> 02:09:37.690
point,

4479
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:38.523
whatever.

4480
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:41.710
And it's the same kind of human con.

4481
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:46.180
Some people have this need to be unreasonable to be fundamentalist and their

4482
02:09:46.181 --> 02:09:46.780
beliefs.

4483
02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:47.051
And,

4484
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:49.990
and it is in its own way a prison of belief.

4485
02:09:49.991 --> 02:09:52.450
It is very similar to the kind of,

4486
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:53.530
uh,

4487
02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:54.040
in this,

4488
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.020
in the case we were talking about with Islam for that very similar mindset as a

4489
02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:00.250
Islamic fundamentalists.

4490
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:00.581
Well,

4491
02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:02.440
it's a lot of people are angry.

4492
02:10:02.650 --> 02:10:02.950
Look,

4493
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:05.350
there's a lot of men who are angry at women.

4494
02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:05.980
Okay.

4495
02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.690
The angry male movement,

4496
02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:09.730
like there's the men's rights movement.

4497
02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:13.900
There's a lot of those guys are fucking very angry at women.

4498
02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:16.630
There's a lot of the pickup artist movement.

4499
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:17.320
God,

4500
02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:17.951
those guys,

4501
02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:18.880
there's a lot of them.

4502
02:10:18.970 --> 02:10:19.661
Not all of them,

4503
02:10:19.661 --> 02:10:21.610
but a lot of them that I've read,

4504
02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:22.600
I've read forums,

4505
02:10:22.601 --> 02:10:24.400
I've listened to these guys talk and videos.

4506
02:10:24.401 --> 02:10:27.310
There's a lot of them that are clearly angry with women.

4507
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:28.960
And one of the big arguments,

4508
02:10:28.961 --> 02:10:29.794
one of the big,

4509
02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:30.410
uh,

4510
02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:32.560
the big points of contention,

4511
02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:36.770
the big things they're pissed off about is them not being attractive to women.

4512
02:10:36.771 --> 02:10:38.000
Because women want money.

4513
02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:39.440
Women want status,

4514
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:40.910
women want good looking guys.

4515
02:10:40.911 --> 02:10:41.391
They want this,

4516
02:10:41.391 --> 02:10:41.931
they want that.

4517
02:10:41.931 --> 02:10:45.580
So these pickup artists are showing you ways to circumnavigate that ways.

4518
02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:48.530
But there's this one video with this guy and long hair and he's trying to be

4519
02:10:48.531 --> 02:10:49.364
like a cool guy.

4520
02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:49.970
He's like,

4521
02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:52.370
I don't give a fuck if you were in a wheelchair.

4522
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:53.020
I saw,

4523
02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:53.853
have you seen this video?

4524
02:10:54.150 --> 02:10:54.850
Tony says,

4525
02:10:54.850 --> 02:10:55.010
he,

4526
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:56.060
she had a fuck.

4527
02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:57.111
He's somebody he wanted.

4528
02:10:57.111 --> 02:10:58.370
He wanted to be in my podcast.

4529
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.641
I was like,

4530
02:10:58.641 --> 02:11:00.950
it was fucking preposterous.

4531
02:11:00.951 --> 02:11:01.880
He's disgusting.

4532
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:02.800
And what these,

4533
02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.820
this idea is based on the fact that there's some people that just women don't

4534
02:11:07.821 --> 02:11:09.710
find attractive and they feel like it's not fair.

4535
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:10.670
So they go out,

4536
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:11.321
they try to pick,

4537
02:11:11.321 --> 02:11:13.880
they're gonna manipulate their way until her pants was a trying to,

4538
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:15.710
because otherwise they're not going to get in there.

4539
02:11:15.711 --> 02:11:16.544
They're just not.

4540
02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:17.031
You know?

4541
02:11:17.031 --> 02:11:17.864
And why?

4542
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:21.080
One of the reasons why a lot of this is an issue and this is what's really

4543
02:11:21.081 --> 02:11:21.914
fucked up.

4544
02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.920
Prostitution's illegal and prostitution should be fucking legal.

4545
02:11:26.210 --> 02:11:26.460
You know?

4546
02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:30.810
And if prostitution was legal and it was sanctioned and women were tested,

4547
02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:31.610
have an outlet,

4548
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:33.140
you would have an outlet and men would,

4549
02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:37.760
wouldn't have to like feel always that there's no way and no one's ever going to

4550
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:38.594
touch them.

4551
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:39.793
It's true.

4552
02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:43.970
He wants to think that there's something awful and terrible about prostitution.

4553
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:44.360
Look,

4554
02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.100
I don't want my daughter becoming a prostitute,

4555
02:11:46.101 --> 02:11:46.760
but guess what?

4556
02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:48.830
I don't want my daughter working at Wendy's either.

4557
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:50.570
I don't want my daughter being a waitress.

4558
02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:54.740
If someone can give you a massage and a massage is totally legal.

4559
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:55.574
What does a massage?

4560
02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:57.500
It's someone they don't want to touch you.

4561
02:11:57.740 --> 02:11:57.981
Okay.

4562
02:11:57.981 --> 02:11:59.450
They're touching you because you're paying them.

4563
02:11:59.451 --> 02:11:59.780
That's right.

4564
02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:01.250
And you feel good when they touch you.

4565
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:02.990
Why is that okay?

4566
02:12:02.991 --> 02:12:05.120
But jerking you off is not okay.

4567
02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.350
In Asian countries,

4568
02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.580
they don't feel that way.

4569
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:08.750
In a matter of fact,

4570
02:12:08.751 --> 02:12:10.130
in a lot of those countries,

4571
02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:14.560
massage with a jerk off at the end is a natural part of massage.

4572
02:12:14.590 --> 02:12:16.110
Or what about just a woman who,

4573
02:12:16.111 --> 02:12:16.500
who,

4574
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.880
who is willing to die for a certain price?

4575
02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:21.890
Fuck you shit.

4576
02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:23.300
She's in command of her own body.

4577
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:26.480
She's willing to engage in a transaction with you,

4578
02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:28.070
an economic transaction.

4579
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:28.933
You want to touch this?

4580
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:30.171
No problem.

4581
02:12:30.171 --> 02:12:30.891
It's on my terms.

4582
02:12:30.891 --> 02:12:32.840
No problem on her anal.

4583
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:34.910
And why can't she make her rate?

4584
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.030
Why can't you say,

4585
02:12:36.031 --> 02:12:36.261
look,

4586
02:12:36.261 --> 02:12:37.460
do you want to have sex with me?

4587
02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:39.470
If you're kind to me and you're nice,

4588
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:40.333
I will have sex with you.

4589
02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:42.140
I want $5,000 right.

4590
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:42.591
You know,

4591
02:12:42.591 --> 02:12:45.650
and she can have sex once a month and that's it.

4592
02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.660
And she doesn't have to work for the rest of the fucking month.

4593
02:12:47.970 --> 02:12:50.660
She gets all of her bills paid and she's done right.

4594
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:51.970
Where does she know?

4595
02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:53.023
Shit.

4596
02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:54.440
It's,

4597
02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.273
it's,

4598
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:58.940
but it's the idea of being that that person is a Sicko.

4599
02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:00.530
But we were talking about,

4600
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.170
um,

4601
02:13:01.170 --> 02:13:05.720
dominatrixes while we were in camp and one of the things we were talking about

4602
02:13:05.721 --> 02:13:10.721
was like how weird it is that people like a lot of like really rich and powerful

4603
02:13:10.731 --> 02:13:13.970
men especially pay to get dominated by women.

4604
02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:17.330
Like women will tie them up and fucking rope their balls to the ground and all

4605
02:13:17.331 --> 02:13:18.520
that shit you were talking to me about.

4606
02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.530
And that's okay.

4607
02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:22.500
Like somehow under the,

4608
02:13:22.501 --> 02:13:23.420
that's okay.

4609
02:13:23.630 --> 02:13:27.890
Like that falls it because the guy is kind of being brutalized.

4610
02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.090
Like it's okay.

4611
02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:30.650
Even if it's like sexual,

4612
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:31.530
it's,

4613
02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:32.430
it's like weird,

4614
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:35.400
but if it's just straight sex,

4615
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:35.941
you know,

4616
02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:38.850
if the woman puts our mouth in the guy's penis for 10 minutes,

4617
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.170
escalation I guess or whatever.

4618
02:13:40.670 --> 02:13:41.700
Well that had,

4619
02:13:41.701 --> 02:13:42.534
doesn't I have it.

4620
02:13:42.610 --> 02:13:44.430
It's origins in religion,

4621
02:13:44.431 --> 02:13:45.030
religion.

4622
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:46.020
And so again,

4623
02:13:46.021 --> 02:13:47.940
this is where to nature of this country.

4624
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:48.691
And so that,

4625
02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:53.160
that again is what I'm saying about we live in a very religious country in many

4626
02:13:53.161 --> 02:13:53.401
ways.

4627
02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:55.710
And whenever you look at Islam or you look at Christianity,

4628
02:13:55.711 --> 02:13:58.560
I believe that the majority of people from any religion,

4629
02:13:58.561 --> 02:13:59.700
if you really talk to them,

4630
02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:00.540
hey,

4631
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.190
we have a lot more in common.

4632
02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.890
Americans have a lot more in common with,

4633
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:10.760
I bet I bet a lot of the average Arab on the street,

4634
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:11.581
and I've got to,

4635
02:14:11.581 --> 02:14:12.660
if you really get them alone,

4636
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:14.430
a lot more in common than you think.

4637
02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:14.731
I mean,

4638
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:15.121
my God,

4639
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:16.070
we want Ma,

4640
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:18.840
I guarantee most of them want some saying who governs them.

4641
02:14:18.930 --> 02:14:21.090
Most people have doubts about their religion.

4642
02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:24.480
Most people don't want to see people suffer and be heard,

4643
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:25.980
even though their religion might say,

4644
02:14:25.981 --> 02:14:27.120
you should stone somebody,

4645
02:14:27.121 --> 02:14:27.631
et Cetera,

4646
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:28.380
et cetera.

4647
02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:29.850
Most people are reasonable.

4648
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:31.350
Most people are that way.

4649
02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:31.951
And,

4650
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:36.120
and it is the loudest lunatic fringe that tends to sway the debate.

4651
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:37.170
Look at this country,

4652
02:14:37.171 --> 02:14:38.340
look at the parties,

4653
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:40.350
the Republican and Democratic Party.

4654
02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:41.251
Look at,

4655
02:14:41.251 --> 02:14:42.930
look at who really gets all the headlines.

4656
02:14:42.931 --> 02:14:44.360
It's allowed as motherfuckers.

4657
02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:44.761
Yeah.

4658
02:14:44.761 --> 02:14:47.550
And it's also if you grew up in that environment,

4659
02:14:47.551 --> 02:14:51.150
the reality is if that was your standard of behavior,

4660
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:54.000
if you were around people like those guys in that video,

4661
02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:54.511
you know,

4662
02:14:54.511 --> 02:14:57.360
Hamani of fuel belong to regular mosque.

4663
02:14:57.630 --> 02:14:58.190
If you were,

4664
02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.250
if you around that guy,

4665
02:14:59.251 --> 02:15:00.420
you'd be like that guy.

4666
02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:04.020
That's the reality is we imitate our atmosphere or you or you would assume the

4667
02:15:04.021 --> 02:15:05.100
position when you're in church.

4668
02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:07.600
Then you go about your day and life is busy and you're like,

4669
02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:07.900
you know,

4670
02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:09.060
and in that sense,

4671
02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:09.390
uh,

4672
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:10.710
I can see,

4673
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:15.540
I totally see this pendulum swifty shifting back and forth in this,

4674
02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:17.190
this yes means yes,

4675
02:15:17.191 --> 02:15:22.020
I kind of see the origins of it and I kind of see like I see the whole thing

4676
02:15:22.021 --> 02:15:23.610
from a larger perspective,

4677
02:15:23.970 --> 02:15:28.970
but I just feel that as human beings trying to engineer our society that what we

4678
02:15:30.661 --> 02:15:35.190
should really be trying to do if it is at all possible,

4679
02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:40.530
is approach each other and approach these situations with kindness and

4680
02:15:40.531 --> 02:15:44.280
compassion and live off of and dignity and,

4681
02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.330
and friendship.

4682
02:15:45.331 --> 02:15:50.331
The idea that we could establish friendship and established that people who are

4683
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:54.090
in certain situations do things that they regret,

4684
02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.740
whether it's a woman getting drunk,

4685
02:15:55.741 --> 02:15:59.310
having sex with a guy she didn't really want to have sex with after the fact

4686
02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:00.000
when she realized like,

4687
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:00.600
what have I done?

4688
02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.830
Blow and,

4689
02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:02.670
but let's,

4690
02:16:02.670 --> 02:16:05.130
let's approach this with compassion.

4691
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.950
Let's understand,

4692
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:06.300
let's,

4693
02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:11.300
let's counsel these people to not get drunk and make poor choices.

4694
02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:16.490
Let's not turn the men into rapists or use that term where there are real

4695
02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:17.460
rapist.

4696
02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:20.430
There are people that fucking hate women and they want to hold him down and put

4697
02:16:20.431 --> 02:16:21.540
a knife to the neck and fuck them.

4698
02:16:21.541 --> 02:16:23.720
Just they can say they did it right because they're evil cunt,

4699
02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:23.960
right?

4700
02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.560
Those guys should be in jail.

4701
02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:29.100
But the guy who gets drunk and has sex with a girl who says,

4702
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:29.501
uh,

4703
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:30.460
do you have a condom?

4704
02:16:30.461 --> 02:16:31.480
And the guy says yes,

4705
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:32.530
and then text her friend.

4706
02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:33.490
I'm coming over.

4707
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:34.930
I'm going to go have sex with this guy.

4708
02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:36.160
That's not wait.

4709
02:16:36.161 --> 02:16:38.860
But that's just personal responsibility.

4710
02:16:38.861 --> 02:16:43.450
And to say that this young 18 year old guy is supposed to have more

4711
02:16:43.451 --> 02:16:46.090
responsibility in that scenario than the 18 year old girl.

4712
02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:47.890
He's totally sexist.

4713
02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:48.250
Yup.

4714
02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.150
Completely.

4715
02:16:49.170 --> 02:16:50.003
It's unfair,

4716
02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:50.650
unfair,

4717
02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:52.360
totally unfair and evil.

4718
02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:53.170
It's evil.

4719
02:16:53.170 --> 02:16:53.710
Yeah.

4720
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:55.150
That's really sexist.

4721
02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:55.481
I mean,

4722
02:16:55.481 --> 02:16:58.930
that's like one of the most sexist approaches to,

4723
02:16:58.931 --> 02:17:00.250
to human beings,

4724
02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:03.670
enjoying each other's company that I could even imagine because you're dealing

4725
02:17:03.671 --> 02:17:05.350
with a completely even scenario,

4726
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:08.290
a guy and a girl communicating that they want to be together.

4727
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.180
The girl communicating to her friend,

4728
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:12.610
she's about to go have sex saying,

4729
02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.170
I'm going to go have sex now.

4730
02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:15.160
Uh,

4731
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.700
Francis Fukuyama who is the,

4732
02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:17.290
is

4733
02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:17.621
<v 2>like,</v>

4734
02:17:17.621 --> 02:17:18.010
you know,

4735
02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:20.970
Harold has this incredible intellectual,

4736
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.701
just wrote this book.

4737
02:17:21.701 --> 02:17:22.930
Now it's coming out and you know,

4738
02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:23.773
he's just,

4739
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.730
he said that,

4740
02:17:24.730 --> 02:17:25.870
that if you look at history,

4741
02:17:25.871 --> 02:17:26.050
it's,

4742
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:27.430
it's been Manz,

4743
02:17:27.610 --> 02:17:28.091
Manz,

4744
02:17:28.091 --> 02:17:29.260
quest for dignity.

4745
02:17:29.261 --> 02:17:30.130
Like every culture,

4746
02:17:30.131 --> 02:17:33.790
every person that that's what people really strive for as nations,

4747
02:17:33.791 --> 02:17:34.624
as people.

4748
02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.730
Just the idea that they want some dignity.

4749
02:17:36.731 --> 02:17:38.770
They want some governance over their own body.

4750
02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:40.540
They want fair play.

4751
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:41.800
They want to be heard.

4752
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:43.330
They want to not be humiliated.

4753
02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:44.260
All those things.

4754
02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:47.080
And it's kind of an interesting thing if you think about it under under one

4755
02:17:47.081 --> 02:17:47.441
word,

4756
02:17:47.441 --> 02:17:48.760
what human beings really,

4757
02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:54.290
that human history has been sort of a march and a quest for dignity by people's

4758
02:17:54.891 --> 02:17:55.750
and by individual.

4759
02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:59.510
<v 1>We're trying to engineer a more idealistic society.</v>

4760
02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:04.630
Slowly but surely from the dark ages on to 2014 from the beginning of writing

4761
02:18:06.051 --> 02:18:07.760
shit down on animal skins,

4762
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:12.910
trying to establish a set of moral principles based on the word of God or Allah

4763
02:18:13.131 --> 02:18:15.650
or Buddha or whoever the fuck you want.

4764
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:17.900
We're trying to figure out a way to do things better.

4765
02:18:17.930 --> 02:18:18.230
Yeah.

4766
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.901
And that's what we're still,

4767
02:18:18.901 --> 02:18:19.460
that's right.

4768
02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:20.570
And so a law like this,

4769
02:18:20.571 --> 02:18:21.381
the yes means yes.

4770
02:18:21.381 --> 02:18:22.061
Where they're trying to do,

4771
02:18:22.061 --> 02:18:23.780
they're trying to stop sexual assault on campus,

4772
02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:24.890
which is a real issue.

4773
02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:26.060
I,

4774
02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:26.841
I agree.

4775
02:18:26.841 --> 02:18:27.440
We're away.

4776
02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:27.800
Yes.

4777
02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:28.130
Right.

4778
02:18:28.130 --> 02:18:28.400
But,

4779
02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:31.460
but it's a question of what your methodology is and whether you're creating more

4780
02:18:31.461 --> 02:18:34.220
damage than good when you're being fair in this or not.

4781
02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:36.320
And I think that's where the debate has to start.

4782
02:18:36.350 --> 02:18:37.640
What is the common goal?

4783
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:38.960
We don't want people to be raped.

4784
02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:40.160
We all agree with that.

4785
02:18:40.161 --> 02:18:41.660
If you're a reasonable person and a good guy,

4786
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:44.210
and now the question is what's the best way to do that,

4787
02:18:44.211 --> 02:18:47.570
but how can anybody ever think that?

4788
02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:49.610
Getting people to say,

4789
02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:50.721
you know,

4790
02:18:50.721 --> 02:18:51.470
like say,

4791
02:18:51.470 --> 02:18:52.010
okay,

4792
02:18:52.010 --> 02:18:53.300
do you want to have sex with me?

4793
02:18:53.301 --> 02:18:53.631
Yes.

4794
02:18:53.631 --> 02:18:56.720
I want to say that's the only way to do what I want.

4795
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:57.560
Romance Man.

4796
02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:58.850
What about movies?

4797
02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.241
Yeah.

4798
02:18:59.241 --> 02:19:00.140
What about the fun of it?

4799
02:19:00.141 --> 02:19:00.291
Like,

4800
02:19:00.291 --> 02:19:00.540
Whoa,

4801
02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:00.921
Holy Shit.

4802
02:19:00.921 --> 02:19:01.581
Look what we're doing.

4803
02:19:01.581 --> 02:19:02.331
This is crazy.

4804
02:19:02.331 --> 02:19:05.780
The Fun of kissing and then a girl reaches and grabs you dick and you're like,

4805
02:19:05.850 --> 02:19:06.683
well,

4806
02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:10.400
you didn't say are we going to have sex now?

4807
02:19:10.401 --> 02:19:11.330
There was no conversation,

4808
02:19:11.331 --> 02:19:13.700
so when you're kissing a girl and she just grabbed your Dick,

4809
02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:16.310
it's one of the greatest moments in life.

4810
02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:17.660
She's dally account.

4811
02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.620
It really is one of the greatest moments in life when you're not sure what's

4812
02:19:21.621 --> 02:19:22.550
going to happen.

4813
02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:23.600
You're young.

4814
02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.990
Kissing was on a date once with this girl and she was I,

4815
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.033
it was done.

4816
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:28.461
<v 9>I thought,</v>

4817
02:19:28.461 --> 02:19:28.731
wow,

4818
02:19:28.731 --> 02:19:29.121
whatever.

4819
02:19:29.121 --> 02:19:31.250
I took on a date and I was trapped pulling out all the stops.

4820
02:19:31.251 --> 02:19:31.910
You know,

4821
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:33.740
talking about this headline about celebrities,

4822
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:34.071
I know,

4823
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:34.421
et Cetera,

4824
02:19:34.421 --> 02:19:35.180
et cetera.

4825
02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:36.080
It was all going well,

4826
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:37.220
but she was like not impressed.

4827
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:38.750
And so finally I was like,

4828
02:19:38.751 --> 02:19:39.111
all right,

4829
02:19:39.111 --> 02:19:39.360
this house,

4830
02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:40.041
it was in New York City.

4831
02:19:40.041 --> 02:19:40.880
I was gonna put her in a cab.

4832
02:19:40.881 --> 02:19:41.570
And she goes,

4833
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:42.620
you put me in a cab.

4834
02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:43.753
<v 3>And I went,</v>

4835
02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:45.470
what do you mean?

4836
02:19:45.471 --> 02:19:46.040
She goes,

4837
02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:46.880
so that's it.

4838
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:48.703
You put me in a cab,

4839
02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:50.453
you're wimping out.

4840
02:19:50.890 --> 02:19:51.723
<v 9>I was like,</v>

4841
02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.150
nevermind.

4842
02:19:53.250 --> 02:19:55.440
Cab driver will go without to my place.

4843
02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:55.790
I was like,

4844
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:56.623
yeah,

4845
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.581
those are the,

4846
02:19:57.581 --> 02:19:59.650
some of the greatest moments of your life as a young man.

4847
02:19:59.850 --> 02:20:00.610
Yeah.

4848
02:20:00.610 --> 02:20:02.060
Those are some fucking good in

4849
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:03.640
<v 3>times when it all works out.</v>

4850
02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:04.493
I mean there's,

4851
02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:06.600
there's ones that work out terribly.

4852
02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:08.860
There's ones that you get together and you know,

4853
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:09.430
you know,

4854
02:20:09.430 --> 02:20:12.840
one person says something stupid and the other person says something stupider

4855
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.691
and you're like,

4856
02:20:13.691 --> 02:20:14.620
oh fuck,

4857
02:20:14.621 --> 02:20:16.090
we're in a fucking quagmire.

4858
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:17.590
No one's getting out of this.

4859
02:20:17.591 --> 02:20:18.424
And can it work?

4860
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.800
Personalities clash and it's,

4861
02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:21.250
you know,

4862
02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:22.001
it doesn't always work,

4863
02:20:22.001 --> 02:20:22.960
but when it does work,

4864
02:20:22.961 --> 02:20:23.171
God,

4865
02:20:23.171 --> 02:20:23.861
it's magic.

4866
02:20:23.861 --> 02:20:28.630
And to try to quantify that magic with a conversation of consent and people say,

4867
02:20:28.631 --> 02:20:28.811
well,

4868
02:20:28.811 --> 02:20:33.070
your romance is not as important as a woman's sexual sovereignty and you need to

4869
02:20:33.071 --> 02:20:35.320
establish the fucking,

4870
02:20:35.350 --> 02:20:39.940
the really gross voices in this are not even the women.

4871
02:20:40.090 --> 02:20:45.090
Because I think fundamentally a lot of women probably have a really hard time

4872
02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:47.230
understanding the male urge.

4873
02:20:47.231 --> 02:20:52.231
Just like fundamentally a man has a very difficult time truly conceptualizing

4874
02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:55.570
the idea that a woman wants to get pregnant,

4875
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.381
you know,

4876
02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:56.511
the,

4877
02:20:56.511 --> 02:21:01.090
the urge to have a baby grow in your body's fundamentally a very difficult thing

4878
02:21:01.091 --> 02:21:02.350
for a guy to wrap his head around.

4879
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:07.950
And so when a woman wants to like do something that's illogical to sort of

4880
02:21:09.731 --> 02:21:11.350
regulate male sexuality,

4881
02:21:11.351 --> 02:21:14.020
I almost kind of understand it and almost kind of look at it and I go,

4882
02:21:14.021 --> 02:21:14.621
well yeah,

4883
02:21:14.621 --> 02:21:15.540
I guess they just don't,

4884
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:19.300
maybe they don't know what it's like to be a man,

4885
02:21:19.450 --> 02:21:20.283
you know?

4886
02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:25.320
But when a man steps in and starts saying a bunch of really illogical shit,

4887
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:30.850
when a man starts being like taking radical feminist point of view,

4888
02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:35.980
that shit becomes a very offensive to me because then that's when I know what

4889
02:21:35.981 --> 02:21:37.420
you're really doing is you're,

4890
02:21:37.421 --> 02:21:39.190
you're trying to earn favor.

4891
02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:43.780
You're trying to establish this really unusually moral position.

4892
02:21:43.781 --> 02:21:44.600
Social branding,

4893
02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:45.880
social brownie points,

4894
02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:47.110
social brownie points,

4895
02:21:47.111 --> 02:21:47.710
hashtags,

4896
02:21:47.710 --> 02:21:49.060
social brownie points,

4897
02:21:49.090 --> 02:21:51.560
Hashtag male feminists and you know,

4898
02:21:51.561 --> 02:21:52.030
I mean look,

4899
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.480
again,

4900
02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:53.770
we both have,

4901
02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:55.180
I don't want to call them feminists,

4902
02:21:55.181 --> 02:21:58.210
but we both have what we call humanist values.

4903
02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:01.610
Like I think absolutely everyone should be treated equally in,

4904
02:22:01.611 --> 02:22:01.851
in,

4905
02:22:01.851 --> 02:22:02.640
in the law,

4906
02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:02.771
right?

4907
02:22:02.771 --> 02:22:04.720
But we're not equal in society.

4908
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:06.400
We're just not just like,

4909
02:22:06.401 --> 02:22:08.020
we're not equals stronger,

4910
02:22:08.050 --> 02:22:08.560
faster,

4911
02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:09.250
whatever.

4912
02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:10.330
Some people are smarter.

4913
02:22:10.331 --> 02:22:11.860
It's just the world is weird,

4914
02:22:11.861 --> 02:22:12.131
man.

4915
02:22:12.131 --> 02:22:13.000
Some people are tall,

4916
02:22:13.001 --> 02:22:13.930
some people are short,

4917
02:22:13.931 --> 02:22:15.310
some people were sexually attractive.

4918
02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:15.970
Some people,

4919
02:22:15.970 --> 02:22:16.803
people are not.

4920
02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:18.340
We're not equally funny.

4921
02:22:18.490 --> 02:22:20.620
Some people are not fucking funny.

4922
02:22:20.621 --> 02:22:22.030
They never will be.

4923
02:22:22.210 --> 02:22:23.560
Some people suck at math.

4924
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:24.423
I'm one of them.

4925
02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:26.040
Some people know there's like a lot

4926
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.870
<v 1>of shit that's just not fair.</v>

4927
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.160
It's just the world.

4928
02:22:29.161 --> 02:22:34.161
The world is weird and when men come along and they want to establish some,

4929
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:39.570
some weird fake male behavior rules,

4930
02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.420
and I know what they're doing when I know what they're doing,

4931
02:22:42.421 --> 02:22:46.200
when I know they're saying things and making videos about like that.

4932
02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:48.270
We'd talked about it on the fattiest Russell podcast,

4933
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:50.490
that dear woman video.

4934
02:22:50.530 --> 02:22:51.960
Do you ever see the deer woman video?

4935
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:52.291
Oh,

4936
02:22:52.291 --> 02:22:53.340
you've never seen it either?

4937
02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:54.120
No.

4938
02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:54.953
For Real.

4939
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:56.100
It's Brent.

4940
02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:56.371
Jamie,

4941
02:22:56.371 --> 02:22:57.270
pull it up one more time.

4942
02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:57.640
One more.

4943
02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:58.111
One more time.

4944
02:22:58.111 --> 02:23:00.060
Just say for the folks at home that may not have seen it,

4945
02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:05.180
it's these guys who no woman in their right mind would ever want to touch.

4946
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:06.270
<v 9>Scott.</v>

4947
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:07.103
He's the guy.

4948
02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:08.720
Oh,

4949
02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:09.553
those guys.

4950
02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:10.500
Have you seen it?

4951
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:10.791
Yes.

4952
02:23:10.791 --> 02:23:11.280
Yes.

4953
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:11.660
Yeah.

4954
02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:13.450
I've seen those guys have the perfect,

4955
02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:14.830
you don't have to thank you for your strength.

4956
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:15.953
Yes,

4957
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:18.080
<v 1>thank you for your wonderful characteristics.</v>

4958
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:21.560
We apologize for all the men who have treated you poorly,

4959
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:24.590
like what choking you when you asked to be choked when you get fucked.

4960
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:27.290
There's reality of those cars.

4961
02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:28.550
Those men are traders.

4962
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:33.760
Those men are gender traders and all of them to a man or women or men that women

4963
02:23:34.821 --> 02:23:35.030
want,

4964
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:36.280
I wouldn't want to fuck right.

4965
02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:38.180
That's what they're trying to sit.

4966
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:41.360
Or there's a couple of them that look like players in there that are just taking

4967
02:23:41.361 --> 02:23:41.900
that,

4968
02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:42.980
you know that stance.

4969
02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:45.590
Bad guys had passed creeper posters.

4970
02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:46.940
There's a lot of creepers out there,

4971
02:23:46.941 --> 02:23:47.181
man.

4972
02:23:47.181 --> 02:23:47.960
I'm,

4973
02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:49.190
<v 9>who is it like Dante in,</v>

4974
02:23:49.210 --> 02:23:49.641
in the,

4975
02:23:49.641 --> 02:23:51.860
in the inferno said he goes,

4976
02:23:51.861 --> 02:23:54.410
that imposter is when he created his image of hell,

4977
02:23:54.411 --> 02:23:56.030
which was a cone inverted cone.

4978
02:23:56.031 --> 02:24:00.310
And the very worst of the bottom of the center of the earth are murderers and,

4979
02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:00.751
and,

4980
02:24:00.751 --> 02:24:05.450
and sadistic killers and imposters imposters are actually down there with them.

4981
02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:07.581
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4982
02:24:07.581 --> 02:24:08.660
there's a lot of that out there,

4983
02:24:08.661 --> 02:24:08.871
man.

4984
02:24:08.871 --> 02:24:10.000
There's a lot of both.

4985
02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:11.060
There's just a lot of,

4986
02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:11.720
again,

4987
02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:13.700
there's a lot of uneven in the world,

4988
02:24:13.701 --> 02:24:17.230
but there's a lot of people that are these member.

4989
02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:19.250
When do you ever see Peter Schiff?

4990
02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:21.170
When he was at occupy Wall Street,

4991
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:24.290
there was a bunch of people that were,

4992
02:24:24.291 --> 02:24:24.490
uh,

4993
02:24:24.490 --> 02:24:26.630
on occupy Wall Street and he had this video.

4994
02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:27.290
Peter Shifts.

4995
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:27.891
Brilliant Guy,

4996
02:24:27.891 --> 02:24:29.750
economist and I had him on the podcast.

4997
02:24:29.751 --> 02:24:30.584
Fascinating.

4998
02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:33.020
I don't necessarily agree with all of his points of view,

4999
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:37.730
but he's a very bright man and he knows so much more about economics than I ever

5000
02:24:37.731 --> 02:24:38.390
will.

5001
02:24:38.390 --> 02:24:39.890
And he was talking to these people.

5002
02:24:40.250 --> 02:24:41.330
He set up a booth,

5003
02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.621
like a stand,

5004
02:24:42.621 --> 02:24:42.801
you know,

5005
02:24:42.801 --> 02:24:43.820
and had a big sign that said,

5006
02:24:43.821 --> 02:24:46.070
ask a one percenter and a,

5007
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:46.851
if you've never seen it,

5008
02:24:46.851 --> 02:24:47.081
pull it,

5009
02:24:47.081 --> 02:24:48.680
pull that up because it's fucking amazing.

5010
02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:51.200
And it's these people that are angry man,

5011
02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:54.830
but their ideas are so uninformed,

5012
02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.410
poorly thought out and easily picked apart.

5013
02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:58.310
And one of those was like,

5014
02:24:58.310 --> 02:24:59.840
why do you need so much money,

5015
02:24:59.841 --> 02:25:00.261
man?

5016
02:25:00.261 --> 02:25:00.560
He's like,

5017
02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.610
I employed a hundred people.

5018
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:02.330
Who Do you employ?

5019
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:03.230
How many people do you employ?

5020
02:25:03.231 --> 02:25:04.190
How many people do you help?

5021
02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:04.971
Like you're,

5022
02:25:04.971 --> 02:25:05.661
you're asking me,

5023
02:25:05.661 --> 02:25:07.040
why do I need so much money?

5024
02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:07.840
Why do I make so much?

5025
02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:08.601
This is capitalism.

5026
02:25:08.601 --> 02:25:09.291
You're a capitalist too.

5027
02:25:09.291 --> 02:25:10.160
You're just not good at it.

5028
02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:10.880
You know,

5029
02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:11.451
like you do,

5030
02:25:11.451 --> 02:25:12.410
you pay money for food,

5031
02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:13.430
do you pay money for rent?

5032
02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.510
Well then you're a capitalist.

5033
02:25:14.511 --> 02:25:15.590
You get paid for work.

5034
02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:16.533
Do you get paid for work?

5035
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.790
Yes,

5036
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:17.540
you get paid for work.

5037
02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:18.410
You're a capitalist.

5038
02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:19.530
Like you're just not good at it.

5039
02:25:19.531 --> 02:25:20.331
Like I was incredible,

5040
02:25:20.331 --> 02:25:21.164
amazing.

5041
02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:22.970
Asked the 1% and I agree,

5042
02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:24.003
the sentiment

5043
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.320
<v 10>and I agree with the fact that you should be protesting.</v>

5044
02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.520
It's just my point is it's Washington that should it be the recipient of the

5045
02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:30.911
protest.

5046
02:25:30.911 --> 02:25:34.270
You guys should be marching on to White House and the Federal Reserve demanding

5047
02:25:34.271 --> 02:25:35.104
your freedom back.

5048
02:25:35.170 --> 02:25:35.380
Look,

5049
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:36.820
Steve Jobs just passed away.

5050
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:37.721
He made billions.

5051
02:25:37.721 --> 02:25:40.220
How many people here have I phones in their pockets?

5052
02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:41.473
You know,

5053
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:43.750
he's not a humanitarian.

5054
02:25:43.751 --> 02:25:44.620
He's a businessman.

5055
02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:49.350
He enriched the lives of millions of people pursuing his own self and not a ramp

5056
02:25:49.470 --> 02:25:51.520
that you can do an Ollie in front of your camera.

5057
02:25:51.521 --> 02:25:53.350
I actually want to have a conversation.

5058
02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:59.100
What the 99% to 1% meme was just one meme out of many names.

5059
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:03.650
I'm so sorry.

5060
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:06.640
A popular Turner phrase.

5061
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:07.603
Okay,

5062
02:26:07.690 --> 02:26:08.111
so the,

5063
02:26:08.111 --> 02:26:08.291
the,

5064
02:26:08.291 --> 02:26:08.461
the,

5065
02:26:08.461 --> 02:26:08.641
the,

5066
02:26:08.641 --> 02:26:09.310
the catchphrase,

5067
02:26:09.310 --> 02:26:12.250
99% this is not 99% park.

5068
02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:17.730
It's Liberty Plaza and the 99% catch phrase is not definitive of everyone here.

5069
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:26.950
It makes sense why a popularity meme would be popular.

5070
02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.450
I understand you have to make money,

5071
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:31.690
but there's got to be regulations because I believe in democracy,

5072
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:33.430
but I also believe in regulations.

5073
02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.980
The market has to grow at a sensible rate,

5074
02:26:35.981 --> 02:26:36.430
right?

5075
02:26:36.430 --> 02:26:37.540
You can not grow too fast.

5076
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:39.070
If the market grows too fast,

5077
02:26:39.071 --> 02:26:39.904
it will crash.

5078
02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:40.720
See,

5079
02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:42.940
the regulation we want is the market.

5080
02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.590
That's the regulation that works.

5081
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:46.330
The same thing is with Labor.

5082
02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:49.840
A corporation just can't take advantage of its workers and pay them as little as

5083
02:26:49.841 --> 02:26:54.220
it wants because businesses can eat with one another to by Labor.

5084
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:55.750
He did a corporation and slavery.

5085
02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:56.773
Here we go.

5086
02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:57.693
Well,

5087
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:00.880
what the slavery have to do with what we're talking about.

5088
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:01.930
We're saying,

5089
02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:02.840
we're saying there,

5090
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:06.340
there is a role for government in our society and incorporate bullet,

5091
02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:08.770
but slavery was wrong to begin with,

5092
02:27:08.771 --> 02:27:09.490
so let's not even,

5093
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:10.301
it was government.

5094
02:27:10.301 --> 02:27:11.134
They created.

5095
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:13.330
Government is there to protect property,

5096
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:13.751
life,

5097
02:27:13.751 --> 02:27:14.320
liberty,

5098
02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:15.040
and that's it.

5099
02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:15.250
I mean,

5100
02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:16.270
you've mentioned Walmart,

5101
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:18.370
so what are you afraid that Walmart's going to do to you?

5102
02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:19.040
What?

5103
02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.150
What am I afraid they're going to build?

5104
02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.060
What is Walmart?

5105
02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:24.880
You'd go and ask the employees that are working in sweatshops type conditions.

5106
02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:28.010
Don't get enough hours that don't have healthcare.

5107
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.983
How isn't it?

5108
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:30.220
Why don't they quit?

5109
02:27:30.221 --> 02:27:30.461
I mean,

5110
02:27:30.461 --> 02:27:32.080
Walmart doesn't hold a gun to their head.

5111
02:27:32.081 --> 02:27:32.310
If,

5112
02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:33.570
if they can get a better job.

5113
02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:36.220
So why did the rape victim get raped?

5114
02:27:36.221 --> 02:27:37.720
Who was she doing out late at night?

5115
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:41.380
You want to go back to 1920 1930 I what does this golden year?

5116
02:27:41.470 --> 02:27:43.210
I don't want to help kids wanting to go back to,

5117
02:27:43.211 --> 02:27:43.510
I don't want,

5118
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:46.120
well here the sixties the seventies I don't care.

5119
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.070
I don't want to go back to that technology,

5120
02:27:48.071 --> 02:27:49.900
but I want to go back to that level of freedom.

5121
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:50.940
I want the level,

5122
02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.390
it was more of Woo voted some point African Americans in.

5123
02:27:55.391 --> 02:27:55.531
Huh?

5124
02:27:55.531 --> 02:27:58.600
I know there's had to ride in the back and telling you you want to go back here.

5125
02:27:58.870 --> 02:28:01.090
We don't want to go back telling you there's more,

5126
02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:02.710
there's more economic freedom.

5127
02:28:02.711 --> 02:28:03.730
It was more economic,

5128
02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.460
social freedom and social justice.

5129
02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:09.760
There's been memorials for Steve jobs all over the place.

5130
02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.050
At every apple store,

5131
02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:11.861
every,

5132
02:28:11.861 --> 02:28:12.250
every,

5133
02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:12.520
there's,

5134
02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:15.610
there's reporters that are all around the world that never asked one single

5135
02:28:15.611 --> 02:28:17.440
question to Steve jobs when he was alive.

5136
02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:22.860
Why are you manufacturing your iPhone in China and you don't have any of your

5137
02:28:23.121 --> 02:28:23.931
manufacturing?

5138
02:28:23.931 --> 02:28:25.100
He cannot tell you why.

5139
02:28:25.101 --> 02:28:25.801
Because we made.

5140
02:28:25.801 --> 02:28:27.650
I think that's fair to the American people.

5141
02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:29.840
The American people don't own those jobs.

5142
02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:32.780
Steve jobs has the right to manufacture where he wants.

5143
02:28:32.810 --> 02:28:36.110
He doesn't have a right to do it and the problem is we have made it too

5144
02:28:36.111 --> 02:28:37.070
expensive for him.

5145
02:28:37.071 --> 02:28:38.480
The manufacturer here with our,

5146
02:28:38.530 --> 02:28:38.701
we,

5147
02:28:38.701 --> 02:28:39.181
the governor.

5148
02:28:39.181 --> 02:28:42.210
Mexican workers want too much because the government much,

5149
02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:42.561
oh,

5150
02:28:42.561 --> 02:28:43.840
it's the member.

5151
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:47.220
The reason that that employee employers,

5152
02:28:47.230 --> 02:28:51.380
right want a lower wages is because their customers want low prices.

5153
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:53.840
Everybody in this park once low prices,

5154
02:28:53.930 --> 02:28:55.460
you can't have low prices.

5155
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.820
No,

5156
02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:56.360
we don't.

5157
02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:56.571
No,

5158
02:28:56.571 --> 02:28:57.020
we don't.

5159
02:28:57.020 --> 02:29:00.580
Do you believe that the federal government has a right to exist in the governor

5160
02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.240
lives of it has the right to exist,

5161
02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:03.280
but not in the form.

5162
02:29:03.281 --> 02:29:04.114
It exists today.

5163
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:05.450
It's operating outside.

5164
02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:07.820
The EPA should be disbanded.

5165
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:09.590
I think it does a lot more harm than good.

5166
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:12.260
Do you believe the FDA should be damned life and get rid of it?

5167
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:13.160
What about the FDA?

5168
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.841
The board?

5169
02:29:14.841 --> 02:29:16.070
I take the board of education.

5170
02:29:16.071 --> 02:29:16.650
We should,

5171
02:29:16.650 --> 02:29:18.080
I want about the board of education.

5172
02:29:18.081 --> 02:29:20.240
I want to get rid of the entire federal department of Education.

5173
02:29:20.241 --> 02:29:20.441
Yes,

5174
02:29:20.441 --> 02:29:24.440
it is wasting our money and it is running up the cost of education or what I've

5175
02:29:24.441 --> 02:29:24.820
learned with,

5176
02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:25.100
well,

5177
02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:25.880
let me finish.

5178
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:28.610
What I've learned over the years is to never argue with a fool.

5179
02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:30.320
And You my friend or fool.

5180
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.651
Okay,

5181
02:29:30.651 --> 02:29:31.550
so on the foolish,

5182
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:32.150
right?

5183
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:34.630
So I just stumbled into all my wealth.

5184
02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:35.900
I run all of these business units.

5185
02:29:35.930 --> 02:29:36.560
How can I say?

5186
02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:41.070
How could you disband the EPA and the EPA and the board of education or it's not

5187
02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:43.050
the border and you're talking about the department.

5188
02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:45.053
Well,

5189
02:29:45.970 --> 02:29:46.803
unity at

5190
02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.540
30% of the homeless people in America are veterans.

5191
02:29:50.810 --> 02:29:53.540
So when everybody says we support the troops,

5192
02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:54.530
that's a lie.

5193
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:57.680
You support the troops when they're out there getting killed or shot.

5194
02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:00.980
But when they come home and they're homeless and they got no jobs,

5195
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.330
you don't support the truth.

5196
02:30:02.331 --> 02:30:02.780
I didn't even know.

5197
02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:06.650
And that's why why didn't even support a lot of these wars then put those trips

5198
02:30:06.651 --> 02:30:07.670
over there in the first place.

5199
02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:09.610
But all right,

5200
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:10.703
<v 1>this guy's crazy.</v>

5201
02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:11.680
<v 10>Okay,</v>

5202
02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.870
you want it to change it all that you guys are the ones,

5203
02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:15.130
or at least he's got his hand on Wall Street,

5204
02:30:15.131 --> 02:30:18.070
are the ones that are funding all the campaigns that putting these people in

5205
02:30:18.071 --> 02:30:21.160
power in the first place and then you do so because you know that they will

5206
02:30:21.161 --> 02:30:22.450
enact policies that you want.

5207
02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:25.750
And then you also know that once they do that and you become friends with them

5208
02:30:25.751 --> 02:30:27.640
through campaign fundraising and all that,

5209
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:28.810
and that is the problem,

5210
02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:30.610
that they will make you into government and you'll be like,

5211
02:30:30.611 --> 02:30:30.851
hey,

5212
02:30:30.851 --> 02:30:31.150
can I,

5213
02:30:31.150 --> 02:30:32.380
can I be secretary of the Treasury?

5214
02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:34.450
If they had no power,

5215
02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:35.770
there'd be no lobbying.

5216
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:36.400
They'd have beat,

5217
02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:37.660
there'd be nothing to give out.

5218
02:30:37.810 --> 02:30:41.470
We don't want the government to be able to pick winners and losers to say you

5219
02:30:41.471 --> 02:30:42.790
get a bail out and you don't.

5220
02:30:42.910 --> 02:30:43.301
You get,

5221
02:30:43.301 --> 02:30:45.160
you pay a tax and you get a subsidy.

5222
02:30:45.250 --> 02:30:46.200
That is the problem.

5223
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:50.050
<v 1>Is this one guy that I actually wanted you to focus on that it was like he was</v>

5224
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:50.791
asking him,

5225
02:30:50.791 --> 02:30:52.360
why do you need so much money?

5226
02:30:54.730 --> 02:30:59.110
Why can't you make $10 million instead of $100 million?

5227
02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:01.120
You're talking about glasses.

5228
02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.270
He can't the rocks.

5229
02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.840
Such an example of of with you hold the point of view.

5230
02:31:07.841 --> 02:31:08.770
It takes a long time to earn it.

5231
02:31:09.330 --> 02:31:11.490
<v 10>What the bank does with your money when you deposited there.</v>

5232
02:31:11.491 --> 02:31:12.370
Do you care about the loan?

5233
02:31:12.371 --> 02:31:12.890
I do.

5234
02:31:12.890 --> 02:31:13.980
Why do you worry?

5235
02:31:15.220 --> 02:31:16.640
<v 1>You might be a different one here.</v>

5236
02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:17.780
There's a bunch of these videos.

5237
02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.531
Gutsy guy.

5238
02:31:18.531 --> 02:31:19.580
I love that he did this though.

5239
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.801
He's,

5240
02:31:19.801 --> 02:31:19.980
he's

5241
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.250
<v 2>got,</v>

5242
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:21.180
is it two hours?

5243
02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:21.600
Yeah.

5244
02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:22.590
Oh Jesus Christ.

5245
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.903
It's the wrong one.

5246
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:25.890
There's one that was a short,

5247
02:31:25.891 --> 02:31:28.140
classic example of like you might be angry.

5248
02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:28.621
I understand,

5249
02:31:28.621 --> 02:31:30.660
but it's exactly the great Thoreau quote.

5250
02:31:31.050 --> 02:31:35.490
I see men everywhere hacking at the branches of evil while none are striking the

5251
02:31:35.491 --> 02:31:36.324
route.

5252
02:31:36.470 --> 02:31:37.230
And if you,

5253
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:38.820
if you want to say something's evil,

5254
02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:40.050
if it's Wall Street,

5255
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.370
if it's big Pharma,

5256
02:31:41.430 --> 02:31:42.480
if it's whatever,

5257
02:31:42.810 --> 02:31:46.950
it's so crucial to to establish what you,

5258
02:31:46.951 --> 02:31:51.930
what kind of evil and the way you figured that out is who is the real enemy?

5259
02:31:51.931 --> 02:31:53.280
What is the root cause?

5260
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:55.410
That's why you've got to read.

5261
02:31:55.411 --> 02:31:57.000
That's why you've got to earn your opinion.

5262
02:31:57.001 --> 02:31:58.830
Otherwise you're just shouting in the wind

5263
02:31:58.890 --> 02:32:01.380
<v 3>and you're telling me that you can have a conversation like this where one guy</v>

5264
02:32:01.381 --> 02:32:01.981
has a microphone,

5265
02:32:01.981 --> 02:32:04.500
he's going back and forth handing it to you and to you and you're doing it in a

5266
02:32:04.501 --> 02:32:05.450
video clip and you're saying,

5267
02:32:05.730 --> 02:32:06.091
you know,

5268
02:32:06.091 --> 02:32:07.140
I want to end this.

5269
02:32:07.141 --> 02:32:07.891
I want to end that.

5270
02:32:07.891 --> 02:32:09.240
I want to end up department of Education.

5271
02:32:09.241 --> 02:32:09.931
You're a fool.

5272
02:32:09.931 --> 02:32:10.471
Okay,

5273
02:32:10.471 --> 02:32:11.980
we didn't get anything done here too.

5274
02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:12.691
People shouting.

5275
02:32:12.691 --> 02:32:16.920
Their point would be to really establish what is wrong with the Department of

5276
02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:16.921
Education.

5277
02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:21.330
You have to have a long nuance conversation about what they're doing with how

5278
02:32:21.331 --> 02:32:22.230
they're funded,

5279
02:32:22.231 --> 02:32:23.070
what the problem is,

5280
02:32:23.071 --> 02:32:27.150
how they subsidize college tuition so that it costs so much more for you to

5281
02:32:27.151 --> 02:32:28.080
actually go to college.

5282
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:29.970
The reason why it's so God damn expensive,

5283
02:32:29.971 --> 02:32:32.510
and it would be different if this didn't exist and you know,

5284
02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:35.370
talking to people who know their shit and reading the right

5285
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:37.570
<v 2>books who make a good argument is,</v>

5286
02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:38.810
is how you get closer.

5287
02:32:38.811 --> 02:32:42.140
At least investigation over some time is,

5288
02:32:42.141 --> 02:32:42.350
hey,

5289
02:32:42.350 --> 02:32:45.140
get closer to figuring out where the real problem.

5290
02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:46.440
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

5291
02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:50.970
it's the emotions that flare up when people start talking about things and they

5292
02:32:50.971 --> 02:32:53.760
don't really have an educated opinion on them.

5293
02:32:53.761 --> 02:32:56.100
They just go there because they know something's wrong.

5294
02:32:56.220 --> 02:33:00.060
I equated occupy Wall Street to like white blood cells and I'm like,

5295
02:33:00.061 --> 02:33:01.860
they know there's an effect infection,

5296
02:33:02.010 --> 02:33:04.770
so they all circle around this area of infection,

5297
02:33:04.771 --> 02:33:07.200
but it's not really effect that they're really,

5298
02:33:07.201 --> 02:33:10.050
really good metaphor for that because you're right,

5299
02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:10.650
it was,

5300
02:33:10.650 --> 02:33:12.420
it was a combination of a lot of things,

5301
02:33:12.450 --> 02:33:13.320
but it wasn't effective.

5302
02:33:13.321 --> 02:33:14.550
It's like they got there and the like,

5303
02:33:14.610 --> 02:33:15.141
Ooh,

5304
02:33:15.141 --> 02:33:16.320
this is a fucking infection.

5305
02:33:16.980 --> 02:33:17.940
We're white blood cells.

5306
02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:20.330
But nothing really got done other than expose.

5307
02:33:20.370 --> 02:33:22.300
Well one thing did get done it,

5308
02:33:22.301 --> 02:33:23.670
it opened up the dialog,

5309
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:26.540
but the dialog was already opened up and people understood the bail out,

5310
02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:28.690
bail out bro and

5311
02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:29.101
<v 2>broken.</v>

5312
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:29.934
Didn't know why,

5313
02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:30.660
you know,

5314
02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:30.891
but,

5315
02:33:30.891 --> 02:33:31.590
but yes,

5316
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:32.510
it's,

5317
02:33:32.810 --> 02:33:33.620
it's,

5318
02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:34.620
it's why,

5319
02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:35.221
you know,

5320
02:33:35.221 --> 02:33:40.221
there are some very important and very challenging problems in the world and

5321
02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:43.980
there are people out there that are coming up with good answers.

5322
02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.060
But unfortunately,

5323
02:33:45.061 --> 02:33:46.950
and one of the things that's beautiful about a podcast,

5324
02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:48.050
what I tried to do with mine,

5325
02:33:48.090 --> 02:33:49.800
what you certainly do with yours too,

5326
02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:50.490
very good,

5327
02:33:50.490 --> 02:33:54.390
is that a lot of really good ideas are stuck in books.

5328
02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:58.920
And I think that that technology,

5329
02:33:58.921 --> 02:33:59.701
podcasting,

5330
02:33:59.701 --> 02:34:01.000
if it's done responsibly and a lot of other,

5331
02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.130
a lot of other venues,

5332
02:34:02.131 --> 02:34:04.890
but it's especially is how you get those ideas out of those books.

5333
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.840
Most of us don't have that much time to read.

5334
02:34:06.841 --> 02:34:07.410
Men.

5335
02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:07.921
We don't.

5336
02:34:07.921 --> 02:34:08.940
And I sympathize that.

5337
02:34:08.941 --> 02:34:09.690
I get it.

5338
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:12.090
It's really hard to formulate an educated opinion on shit.

5339
02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:13.133
You and I know that.

5340
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:13.891
You know,

5341
02:34:13.891 --> 02:34:16.830
like how many opinions that we'd have when we started doing podcasting and then

5342
02:34:16.831 --> 02:34:17.770
I get corrected

5343
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.791
<v 1>on this podcast,</v>

5344
02:34:18.791 --> 02:34:19.451
my podcast,

5345
02:34:19.451 --> 02:34:21.550
I'd come up with a point of view and say something and people would be like,

5346
02:34:21.551 --> 02:34:22.384
by the way,

5347
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:22.691
uh,

5348
02:34:22.691 --> 02:34:24.040
you're a little bit wrong on this.

5349
02:34:24.041 --> 02:34:24.461
And I'd go,

5350
02:34:24.461 --> 02:34:26.440
I've been holding that belief for 10 fucking years.

5351
02:34:27.370 --> 02:34:30.760
And when you start to really investigate and try to come up with a really sound,

5352
02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:32.950
strong political philosophy,

5353
02:34:32.951 --> 02:34:33.940
business philosophy,

5354
02:34:33.941 --> 02:34:34.751
life philosophy,

5355
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:37.750
it takes a lot of fucking work and try harder.

5356
02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:39.730
It's hard to let go of opinions,

5357
02:34:39.731 --> 02:34:41.860
but don't stop trying to come up with the answer.

5358
02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:44.620
A lot of people do not ever want to let go of their opinions.

5359
02:34:44.621 --> 02:34:45.700
Once they have that opinion,

5360
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:49.480
that motherfucker is locked in because they form an emotion around it.

5361
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:50.020
That's why,

5362
02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:52.420
because it's exactly like talking to somebody.

5363
02:34:52.421 --> 02:34:54.430
When you see a religious person talked to an atheist,

5364
02:34:54.730 --> 02:34:55.511
the atheist says,

5365
02:34:55.511 --> 02:34:56.350
God doesn't exist.

5366
02:34:56.350 --> 02:34:57.400
The religious person goes,

5367
02:34:57.401 --> 02:34:58.234
wait a minute.

5368
02:34:58.810 --> 02:35:00.790
My religion gives me a feeling.

5369
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:02.290
And a very good feeling.

5370
02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:05.050
It makes me feel like there's purpose and meaning in my life.

5371
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.950
This guy's attacking that and then it becomes about that.

5372
02:35:08.951 --> 02:35:10.360
It becomes not about religion.

5373
02:35:10.361 --> 02:35:10.721
It becomes,

5374
02:35:10.721 --> 02:35:13.390
you're trying to take the feeling I have away from me.

5375
02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:14.400
Fuck you.

5376
02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:14.600
Well,

5377
02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:16.810
it's also I opinions are very hard to let go of.

5378
02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:17.231
Yeah.

5379
02:35:17.231 --> 02:35:17.561
It's all,

5380
02:35:17.561 --> 02:35:21.460
it's also when people are having conversations a lot of times and not just

5381
02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:25.180
expressing each other and exchanging information or expressing themselves,

5382
02:35:25.250 --> 02:35:26.380
exchanging information.

5383
02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:28.010
They're also trying to win.

5384
02:35:28.470 --> 02:35:28.740
You know,

5385
02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:32.230
they're trying to be one with the correct information,

5386
02:35:32.231 --> 02:35:35.950
the trying to be the smarter person and sometimes they're doing it about stuff

5387
02:35:35.951 --> 02:35:38.620
they don't really fucking have any information about,

5388
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:42.210
but they're still in there swinging like flailing away,

5389
02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:44.020
like doesn't know how to fight.

5390
02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.160
Who gets in fights.

5391
02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:45.750
I mean,

5392
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:46.840
if you ever seen a person who's not,

5393
02:35:47.050 --> 02:35:47.790
we all have,

5394
02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:48.160
yes,

5395
02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:49.480
I've talked about it on this podcast,

5396
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:52.480
this terrifying scenario that happened one night in front of the comedy store

5397
02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:56.530
when I saw this guy get in a fight with this guy who didn't have any fucking

5398
02:35:56.531 --> 02:35:57.131
skill at all.

5399
02:35:57.131 --> 02:35:57.881
He didn't know what to do.

5400
02:35:57.881 --> 02:36:00.370
He didn't know how to handle panic and he was his eyes closed.

5401
02:36:00.371 --> 02:36:02.590
He was flailing and a bus pulled in front of me.

5402
02:36:02.591 --> 02:36:03.640
I couldn't see what happened.

5403
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:06.160
You know that because you know they were fighting on one side of the street and

5404
02:36:06.161 --> 02:36:09.760
a bus blocked my vision and then when the bus passed he was out cold on the

5405
02:36:09.761 --> 02:36:10.594
concrete.

5406
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:12.400
So obviously somebody punched him,

5407
02:36:12.401 --> 02:36:14.410
but the guy didn't know how to fight,

5408
02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:15.640
but yet he was still fighting.

5409
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:19.150
And some people will get in arguments about some shit they don't have any

5410
02:36:19.151 --> 02:36:20.020
information about.

5411
02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:21.130
They don't have nothing,

5412
02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:22.420
but they have a point.

5413
02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.100
I have an opinion and an attitude that is based on something that happened to

5414
02:36:27.101 --> 02:36:28.570
them at an emotional thing.

5415
02:36:28.810 --> 02:36:30.400
We all have some of that in us.

5416
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:35.670
I certainly do and I've worked very hard to try to let go of that shit when I'm

5417
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:38.170
in an argument and I sometimes I had to check myself and go,

5418
02:36:38.171 --> 02:36:38.471
man,

5419
02:36:38.471 --> 02:36:43.450
I'm arguing to be right here because this person's attacking something else

5420
02:36:43.451 --> 02:36:45.940
inside of me I'm not even aware of or whatever.

5421
02:36:45.941 --> 02:36:47.200
And you see it in relationships.

5422
02:36:47.201 --> 02:36:47.620
I got to,

5423
02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.250
I got to check myself and my relationship.

5424
02:36:49.251 --> 02:36:52.480
Sometimes we'll just start having an argument and I'm just pissed off and I want

5425
02:36:52.481 --> 02:36:55.840
to have an argument because I feel like I want to be right about this subject

5426
02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:57.370
and when I take a step back,

5427
02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:59.050
a lot of times it's really hard to do,

5428
02:36:59.410 --> 02:37:01.060
but it's really important to them as you go.

5429
02:37:01.061 --> 02:37:01.541
You know what?

5430
02:37:01.541 --> 02:37:02.860
I actually don't know that much.

5431
02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:06.160
Sometimes someone will say something crazy to you and instead of saying,

5432
02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:06.851
wait a minute,

5433
02:37:06.851 --> 02:37:09.430
why'd you say you'll say something crazy back in the next thing you know?

5434
02:37:09.431 --> 02:37:10.840
It's a fucking avalanche of crazy.

5435
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:12.340
Both of your swinging,

5436
02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:16.070
swinging into the air and emotional and fucking can't

5437
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.770
<v 3>breathe good.</v>

5438
02:37:16.770 --> 02:37:17.990
<v 2>It's also really fuck.</v>

5439
02:37:17.991 --> 02:37:22.950
It's also really important to identify what you mean by x.

5440
02:37:23.310 --> 02:37:24.660
What do you mean by God?

5441
02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:26.820
What do you mean by religion?

5442
02:37:27.090 --> 02:37:29.610
What do you mean by first before we start,

5443
02:37:29.611 --> 02:37:30.090
let's,

5444
02:37:30.090 --> 02:37:32.460
let's know what we agree on and it's,

5445
02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:33.990
I like politics.

5446
02:37:33.991 --> 02:37:36.690
I love the argument now that I have with politics is this,

5447
02:37:36.691 --> 02:37:37.650
I don't talk about Republican,

5448
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:38.401
Democrat,

5449
02:37:38.401 --> 02:37:38.761
liberal,

5450
02:37:38.761 --> 02:37:39.594
conservative.

5451
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:43.620
I like the question of we know that you need some governance.

5452
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:45.570
Of course you need some governance in a society.

5453
02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:48.660
The debate really revolves around to what percent,

5454
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:49.680
how much,

5455
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:52.080
how much do you want government running your lives?

5456
02:37:52.170 --> 02:37:54.690
There's an answer and some people want more.

5457
02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:55.560
There's just an answer.

5458
02:37:55.561 --> 02:37:57.750
How to what degree in what aspect?

5459
02:37:57.780 --> 02:38:01.980
It's a complicated question but start the debate and the discussion that way and

5460
02:38:01.981 --> 02:38:02.940
you'll get further along.

5461
02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:04.890
I like having my mind changed.

5462
02:38:05.430 --> 02:38:06.750
I like having my mind changed.

5463
02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:07.620
I like listening.

5464
02:38:07.621 --> 02:38:11.280
Like you were talking the other day and you were explaining like where

5465
02:38:11.281 --> 02:38:14.520
technology was going and I had a lot of opinions so I've been reading the same

5466
02:38:14.521 --> 02:38:17.520
shit and I was about to jump in with a bunch of my points as well,

5467
02:38:17.521 --> 02:38:18.091
but then I was like,

5468
02:38:18.091 --> 02:38:18.271
wait,

5469
02:38:18.271 --> 02:38:21.600
let me just listen to this and I learned some shit that I didn't know before.

5470
02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.010
It's a new thing for me,

5471
02:38:23.011 --> 02:38:23.580
man.

5472
02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:24.690
This is a nice thing for you.

5473
02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:28.530
A little bit like to really listen and key into what somebody's saying and say

5474
02:38:28.531 --> 02:38:32.310
and look for something new and look for something that you might not know

5475
02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:34.800
instead of trying to add to the conversation.

5476
02:38:34.801 --> 02:38:34.951
Hey,

5477
02:38:34.951 --> 02:38:35.371
by the way,

5478
02:38:35.371 --> 02:38:35.671
guys,

5479
02:38:35.671 --> 02:38:37.290
this is something I know as well.

5480
02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:38.693
We all do that.

5481
02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:39.840
We fucking do that all the time.

5482
02:38:39.841 --> 02:38:40.674
Everybody does it.

5483
02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:41.940
Oh Joe saying this,

5484
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.900
let me add,

5485
02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:44.520
let me add this to it.

5486
02:38:44.521 --> 02:38:47.730
Let me put a cherry on that Sunday for you guys to show you that I'm also

5487
02:38:47.731 --> 02:38:48.840
knowledgeable and smart,

5488
02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:49.530
you know,

5489
02:38:49.530 --> 02:38:51.960
instead of just king and maybe not saying anything.

5490
02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:53.273
You know what I like,

5491
02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:53.490
you know,

5492
02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:56.310
I like what answer I liked from people and lot of times what do you think of

5493
02:38:56.311 --> 02:38:56.491
this?

5494
02:38:56.491 --> 02:38:57.324
And a lot of people go,

5495
02:38:57.390 --> 02:38:58.223
I don't know.

5496
02:38:58.880 --> 02:38:59.460
It's good enough.

5497
02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:00.271
<v 3>That's a good answer.</v>

5498
02:39:00.271 --> 02:39:00.600
That's good.

5499
02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:01.560
That's very important.

5500
02:39:01.710 --> 02:39:02.000
Very,

5501
02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:02.910
very important.

5502
02:39:03.570 --> 02:39:05.430
Being able to say you don't know,

5503
02:39:05.730 --> 02:39:06.241
that's like,

5504
02:39:06.241 --> 02:39:07.560
why is that hard for people?

5505
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:10.860
It's hard because we equate our knowledge,

5506
02:39:10.890 --> 02:39:13.950
like how much knowledge we have with a strongly are.

5507
02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:14.730
Yeah.

5508
02:39:14.730 --> 02:39:16.480
And we all know some of the week or per,

5509
02:39:16.650 --> 02:39:16.831
yeah,

5510
02:39:16.831 --> 02:39:18.000
and our personal,

5511
02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:21.030
our personal opinion of them ourselves.

5512
02:39:21.031 --> 02:39:22.890
But we're coming to find out,

5513
02:39:22.891 --> 02:39:24.270
especially in this day and age,

5514
02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:26.220
it's one of the good things about things like Google.

5515
02:39:26.580 --> 02:39:28.590
You can't know everything.

5516
02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:29.610
You cannot,

5517
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:33.300
I've had fucking conversations with people where they seem fairly intelligent

5518
02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:35.250
and then they'll say something,

5519
02:39:35.251 --> 02:39:38.550
they'll want to have a conversation about martial arts and they'll say something

5520
02:39:38.551 --> 02:39:40.800
so off base and so ridiculous.

5521
02:39:40.801 --> 02:39:43.760
Then now I have to question everything that they've said before

5522
02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:46.920
that into my world.

5523
02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.410
And you stepped into my world acting like,

5524
02:39:49.411 --> 02:39:51.030
you know what the fuck you're talking about while I go,

5525
02:39:51.031 --> 02:39:51.151
well,

5526
02:39:51.151 --> 02:39:53.310
how many of these other things you've told me your bullshit too.

5527
02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:54.240
That's so disappointing.

5528
02:39:54.241 --> 02:39:56.790
I've had that happen to me where people will say something and you go,

5529
02:39:56.791 --> 02:40:00.120
you're really smart and a lot of stuff and you just stepped into a different

5530
02:40:00.121 --> 02:40:00.690
arena.

5531
02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:01.021
You're,

5532
02:40:01.021 --> 02:40:01.351
you're,

5533
02:40:01.351 --> 02:40:01.740
uh,

5534
02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:03.720
you're in the middle of the ocean with no boat.

5535
02:40:03.721 --> 02:40:03.950
Right?

5536
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:07.050
It's one of the few things where I'll just completely stop the conversation.

5537
02:40:07.051 --> 02:40:07.231
I go,

5538
02:40:07.231 --> 02:40:07.770
no,

5539
02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:08.250
no,

5540
02:40:08.250 --> 02:40:08.760
stop.

5541
02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:09.180
Yeah.

5542
02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:09.460
I just,

5543
02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:14.220
I get offended when people start talking about like cheese and you know,

5544
02:40:14.221 --> 02:40:14.790
it's about,

5545
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:18.120
it's about your centering your energy and some people can't be pushed over.

5546
02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.930
Please shut the fuck up and your lane,

5547
02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:21.360
you want to see something amazing.

5548
02:40:21.361 --> 02:40:22.650
Now that is real.

5549
02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:25.170
Some real martial arts shit that is kind of like magic.

5550
02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:25.620
Yes.

5551
02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:25.981
Jamie,

5552
02:40:25.981 --> 02:40:27.570
there's a video on my,

5553
02:40:27.571 --> 02:40:28.130
um,

5554
02:40:28.130 --> 02:40:28.680
uh,

5555
02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:33.450
Twitter feed that's from today and is from a long time ago from,

5556
02:40:33.451 --> 02:40:34.950
I think it was a 1950s,

5557
02:40:34.951 --> 02:40:39.120
this fucking old man doing judo with his top students.

5558
02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:41.430
And this old dude is like,

5559
02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:43.830
I don't know how old he is at the time,

5560
02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:45.600
but he's fucking old.

5561
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:47.190
He's old and it's,

5562
02:40:47.370 --> 02:40:47.851
he is,

5563
02:40:47.851 --> 02:40:49.620
he's really frail looking.

5564
02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:53.520
Go full screen on this is this fucking incredible man.

5565
02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:58.820
I mean is this is a really incredible to watch it does it say how old he is in

5566
02:40:58.921 --> 02:40:59.700
this video?

5567
02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.350
If he looks like a stamp,

5568
02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:03.720
Dan preparing to challenge,

5569
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.540
uh,

5570
02:41:04.540 --> 02:41:04.801
he's,

5571
02:41:04.801 --> 02:41:07.770
he's perfect for a challenge with high level students.

5572
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.731
Now Watch,

5573
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:09.810
watch what the fuck happens,

5574
02:41:09.811 --> 02:41:09.960
man.

5575
02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.100
This is a tiny little old man and this isn't bullshit.

5576
02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:14.461
Okay.

5577
02:41:14.461 --> 02:41:16.590
I know bullshit and I know choreography.

5578
02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.100
I'm watching this judo and these guys are really trying to throw this dude,

5579
02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:20.821
but check this out.

5580
02:41:20.821 --> 02:41:21.360
Look at this whole,

5581
02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:22.193
Oh,

5582
02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:23.340
amazing.

5583
02:41:23.610 --> 02:41:24.740
She's perfect technique.

5584
02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:25.351
It has legs.

5585
02:41:25.351 --> 02:41:26.490
Go flying up in the air.

5586
02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:27.330
Look at this,

5587
02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:30.210
how he resists the technique looking effortless.

5588
02:41:30.210 --> 02:41:30.691
Almost.

5589
02:41:30.691 --> 02:41:31.650
This guy's trying to throw him.

5590
02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:32.521
Fuck yeah,

5591
02:41:32.521 --> 02:41:33.330
he is.

5592
02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:34.081
He's trying to throw them,

5593
02:41:34.081 --> 02:41:36.690
but the old man knows exactly how to position himself.

5594
02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.440
Watch,

5595
02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:37.711
look,

5596
02:41:37.711 --> 02:41:38.544
see,

5597
02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:40.470
he goes behind the hip every time.

5598
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:41.610
It's amazing.

5599
02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:42.713
Amazing.

5600
02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:43.470
And watch these,

5601
02:41:43.470 --> 02:41:44.460
these young guys,

5602
02:41:44.461 --> 02:41:46.050
these young black belts are watching this.

5603
02:41:46.170 --> 02:41:47.760
This guy is old as fuck.

5604
02:41:47.761 --> 02:41:49.020
He's much smaller,

5605
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:50.550
but watch how he throws him.

5606
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:51.810
It's incredible.

5607
02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:52.860
He finds the moon.

5608
02:41:52.861 --> 02:41:53.251
Look at this.

5609
02:41:53.251 --> 02:41:53.760
Look at this.

5610
02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.960
Every time he tries to throw him,

5611
02:41:55.430 --> 02:41:57.330
oh,

5612
02:41:58.860 --> 02:41:59.491
and then he,

5613
02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:03.630
they bow to each other and then the next guy comes along and this guy is fucking

5614
02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:04.860
tiny man.

5615
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:06.220
This old dude is PR.

5616
02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:06.720
I mean,

5617
02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:08.430
I don't know how big the other guy is,

5618
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:11.610
but he's significantly smaller than the other guy.

5619
02:42:11.611 --> 02:42:13.980
It's hard because we're not standing there and perspective,

5620
02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:16.650
but we're watching this little old man get rag dog.

5621
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:17.130
It's crazy.

5622
02:42:17.130 --> 02:42:18.140
But when he gets picked in the,

5623
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:19.860
I look at how he just goes with it.

5624
02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:20.611
He,

5625
02:42:20.611 --> 02:42:20.761
me,

5626
02:42:20.761 --> 02:42:24.510
he looked at that guy fucking tried Sam and the old man just,

5627
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:26.040
just flowed with them,

5628
02:42:26.610 --> 02:42:29.010
just got behind his hips and stayed relaxed.

5629
02:42:29.011 --> 02:42:30.480
Like that relaxed,

5630
02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:31.630
stay relaxed.

5631
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:32.071
The guy tried,

5632
02:42:32.071 --> 02:42:32.520
he's,

5633
02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.091
it's wrong.

5634
02:42:33.091 --> 02:42:35.550
You can see okay is 100% but look at this,

5635
02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:36.413
boom.

5636
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:39.750
The old man waits for his moment and throws him.

5637
02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:40.141
I mean it's,

5638
02:42:40.141 --> 02:42:41.100
it's brilliant.

5639
02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:42.450
It's amazing to watch.

5640
02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:44.200
And Jews like a watermelon.

5641
02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:49.080
Juno's one of the roughest when it comes to like martial arts on your body.

5642
02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:54.740
So watching this old really old man throw these young cats around is incredibly

5643
02:42:56.071 --> 02:42:59.310
impressive because of the fact that it's so physically dependent.

5644
02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:02.380
I mean you see like the really great judoka is like,

5645
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:03.940
like look in the UFC like Hector,

5646
02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:09.080
oh the old dude sent that guy fly in shit.

5647
02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:09.281
I mean,

5648
02:43:09.281 --> 02:43:10.440
these are shit.

5649
02:43:10.441 --> 02:43:11.140
It's incredible,

5650
02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:11.500
right?

5651
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:12.101
Whoa,

5652
02:43:12.101 --> 02:43:13.510
this is fucking amazing.

5653
02:43:13.511 --> 02:43:13.890
Me Look,

5654
02:43:13.890 --> 02:43:14.230
look,

5655
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.381
look.

5656
02:43:14.381 --> 02:43:15.950
And he was like a movie.

5657
02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:16.630
Yeah.

5658
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:17.590
Look how he goes with it.

5659
02:43:17.591 --> 02:43:18.670
When the guy tries to throw him,

5660
02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:22.330
he just goes and he's in perfect position every time was hips.

5661
02:43:22.331 --> 02:43:22.630
Yeah.

5662
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:23.321
He just his hips,

5663
02:43:23.321 --> 02:43:24.154
her.

5664
02:43:24.410 --> 02:43:25.570
It's positioning.

5665
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.960
Look at that.

5666
02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:28.210
Oh like I was going to say,

5667
02:43:28.211 --> 02:43:28.541
and these are,

5668
02:43:28.541 --> 02:43:28.811
by the way,

5669
02:43:28.811 --> 02:43:29.621
these are man,

5670
02:43:29.621 --> 02:43:30.880
I don't know what kind of floor that is,

5671
02:43:30.881 --> 02:43:35.530
but that's not like modern fucking mad at floors would probably hard as shit.

5672
02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:37.120
Like Hector Lombard,

5673
02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:38.740
like us physical specimen,

5674
02:43:38.741 --> 02:43:43.210
Ronda Rousey physical specimen and these are like great judoka is that are in

5675
02:43:43.270 --> 02:43:44.470
mixed martial arts today.

5676
02:43:44.890 --> 02:43:45.191
You know?

5677
02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:48.520
And there's a lot of like their explosion,

5678
02:43:48.521 --> 02:43:51.250
their ability to close the distance and execute techniques that can be

5679
02:43:51.251 --> 02:43:53.620
attributed to this power and athleticism.

5680
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:55.960
But this old dude ain't got none of that man.

5681
02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:56.850
Cause Juno,

5682
02:43:56.850 --> 02:43:58.390
if you watch it like in the Olympics,

5683
02:43:58.391 --> 02:43:59.470
it's so explosive.

5684
02:43:59.471 --> 02:43:59.981
It's like boom.

5685
02:43:59.981 --> 02:44:00.910
It's like so quick.

5686
02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:01.600
It's amazing.

5687
02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:01.830
Let's do,

5688
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:02.471
it's like water.

5689
02:44:02.471 --> 02:44:03.970
He's literally like a ghost.

5690
02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:04.691
Yeah.

5691
02:44:04.691 --> 02:44:05.860
It's incredible,

5692
02:44:05.861 --> 02:44:06.161
man.

5693
02:44:06.161 --> 02:44:07.360
It's incredible to watch.

5694
02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:08.560
Have you ever seen me dance?

5695
02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:10.510
Show up some video that I would,

5696
02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:13.420
I really wish I knew more about this dude.

5697
02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:15.640
How when this was filmed,

5698
02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:16.511
what is this called?

5699
02:44:16.511 --> 02:44:17.344
This a video.

5700
02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.710
It says amazing old judo throw defense.

5701
02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:22.170
The guy's name is [inaudible],

5702
02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:22.620
m.

5703
02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:24.550
I.

5704
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.550
F.

5705
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.550
U.

5706
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.550
N.

5707
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:26.860
E accepts challenges from high level students.

5708
02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.540
It's incredible.

5709
02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:31.240
Look at that guy's really trying course he is.

5710
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:32.103
Of course he is.

5711
02:44:32.170 --> 02:44:35.110
I mean you could see the effort and he's doing the right thing to me.

5712
02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:38.620
The guy who is trying is a fucking high level judoka himself.

5713
02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:39.131
Like,

5714
02:44:39.131 --> 02:44:40.570
look how he's throwing these techniques.

5715
02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:43.420
He's trying these hip tosses and he's not getting anywhere with it.

5716
02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:44.800
Just got ridiculous haircut.

5717
02:44:44.801 --> 02:44:45.220
That guy,

5718
02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:45.881
the old look at this,

5719
02:44:45.881 --> 02:44:46.570
the whole guy just,

5720
02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:48.400
he keeps getting behind his hips.

5721
02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:50.920
You see how he places his weight every time.

5722
02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:52.353
It's just like,

5723
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:53.463
oh shit.

5724
02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:55.660
Oh my main man,

5725
02:44:55.661 --> 02:44:56.800
he can see his opening.

5726
02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.080
You got guys a one as the first,

5727
02:44:59.081 --> 02:44:59.441
Dan,

5728
02:44:59.441 --> 02:45:02.920
he's a first degree black belt and this guy's an eighth degree black belt here,

5729
02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:04.420
but the old man's a 10.

5730
02:45:04.510 --> 02:45:08.500
So this guy right here is like probably the highest level student that he's uh,

5731
02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.150
done it against in this video.

5732
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:12.423
But it's just,

5733
02:45:12.460 --> 02:45:16.720
it just shows how technique is everything.

5734
02:45:16.750 --> 02:45:18.610
It's so fucking important.

5735
02:45:18.611 --> 02:45:23.140
And athleticism with great technique is almost unbeatable.

5736
02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:25.360
It's one of the reasons why a guy like Lombard is so good.

5737
02:45:25.361 --> 02:45:26.620
It's because he has both of those,

5738
02:45:26.890 --> 02:45:27.620
his technique,

5739
02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:28.340
his lumbar.

5740
02:45:28.340 --> 02:45:29.410
I would say if he saw this,

5741
02:45:29.411 --> 02:45:30.340
like what?

5742
02:45:30.341 --> 02:45:31.174
Amazed.

5743
02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:31.571
Well,

5744
02:45:31.571 --> 02:45:33.490
judoka is a very proud of judo,

5745
02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:34.870
judo gene and the bells.

5746
02:45:34.871 --> 02:45:35.710
Very proud of it.

5747
02:45:35.711 --> 02:45:36.790
And Rhonda is proud of it.

5748
02:45:37.210 --> 02:45:39.760
In a judo is a fucking hard martial art man.

5749
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:40.960
It's hard on the body,

5750
02:45:40.961 --> 02:45:45.961
very difficult to learn and it requires a great deal of understanding,

5751
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:49.420
understanding of the mechanics of the body and leverage.

5752
02:45:49.421 --> 02:45:50.330
And Rhonda.

5753
02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:52.600
Rhonda told me she was like 11 and her,

5754
02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:56.620
she broke her toe and she was crying and her mother made her run laps or mother

5755
02:45:56.621 --> 02:45:56.950
goes,

5756
02:45:56.950 --> 02:46:00.190
you might break your toe competition or on labs.

5757
02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.120
She was just like,

5758
02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:01.983
yeah,

5759
02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:03.040
she's a little bad ass.

5760
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:05.020
Her mother's a hard woman.

5761
02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:05.340
Yeah,

5762
02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:06.340
but look what she created.

5763
02:46:06.490 --> 02:46:06.681
Oh,

5764
02:46:06.681 --> 02:46:08.830
she created an extreme winter.

5765
02:46:08.890 --> 02:46:11.690
You know what's interesting is Rhonda is going to uh,

5766
02:46:11.810 --> 02:46:11.991
you know,

5767
02:46:11.991 --> 02:46:15.590
she's going to defend her title against Cat Zingano and if she beats cat

5768
02:46:15.591 --> 02:46:16.424
Zingano.

5769
02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:17.300
Um,

5770
02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:22.300
Cyborg is scheduled to fight as 135 pounder for the first time in December in

5771
02:46:23.511 --> 02:46:24.110
Invicta.

5772
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:28.850
Invicta was as an all female mixed martial arts league and the Cyborg is the 130

5773
02:46:28.851 --> 02:46:30.350
545 pound champ.

5774
02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:32.720
She's dropping down to one 35 for the first time.

5775
02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:34.020
It's fucking very hard cut.

5776
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:37.850
But like a lot of these people that may,

5777
02:46:37.851 --> 02:46:40.580
we did some questionable things that made them get larger.

5778
02:46:40.610 --> 02:46:41.420
Maybe your farm,

5779
02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:45.440
can they lose weight and then they become smaller and you know,

5780
02:46:45.441 --> 02:46:46.440
I mean maybe a different human being.

5781
02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:49.830
Maybe it'd be easier for her now to drop that way.

5782
02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:50.061
I mean,

5783
02:46:50.061 --> 02:46:50.330
I don't,

5784
02:46:50.330 --> 02:46:51.163
I don't know,

5785
02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:52.130
but it's um,

5786
02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.720
it's certainly a very fucking compelling matchup cause Cyborg,

5787
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:58.640
well there was a picture of her and her husband,

5788
02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.210
uh,

5789
02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:03.320
from behind her back was about as wide as her husbands and her husband was a

5790
02:47:03.321 --> 02:47:03.800
stud.

5791
02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:03.981
I mean,

5792
02:47:03.981 --> 02:47:04.620
he was a wide,

5793
02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:04.920
thick,

5794
02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:05.753
strong,

5795
02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:07.430
big thick gal.

5796
02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:07.820
Yeah.

5797
02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:08.570
But you know,

5798
02:47:08.570 --> 02:47:12.200
if you do hardcore cardio like marathon running and shit like that,

5799
02:47:12.201 --> 02:47:17.201
your body will automatically shed this shed you atrophy of the muscle and you're

5800
02:47:17.211 --> 02:47:18.740
going to start slimming down.

5801
02:47:18.741 --> 02:47:19.820
Just change your diet.

5802
02:47:20.090 --> 02:47:21.710
You can force yourself to lose weight.

5803
02:47:22.060 --> 02:47:25.070
You mean you can only force yourself to lose a certain amount and still be

5804
02:47:25.071 --> 02:47:26.180
athletically competitive.

5805
02:47:26.540 --> 02:47:29.060
But she's still doing strength and conditioning exercises.

5806
02:47:29.061 --> 02:47:31.250
She's still doing all sorts of things that build muscle.

5807
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:32.391
And if she didn't,

5808
02:47:32.391 --> 02:47:34.640
if she really wanted to drop down to 135 pounds,

5809
02:47:34.641 --> 02:47:36.230
you'd have to diminish her body mass.

5810
02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:36.571
Who,

5811
02:47:36.571 --> 02:47:37.101
who that,

5812
02:47:37.101 --> 02:47:37.850
you know,

5813
02:47:37.850 --> 02:47:38.840
fighter wise,

5814
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:41.210
I was thinking about Bj Penn,

5815
02:47:41.211 --> 02:47:41.691
but who you know,

5816
02:47:41.691 --> 02:47:46.691
who's really done the fun and the most drastic weight categories like the most

5817
02:47:47.470 --> 02:47:49.820
DJ fought heavyweight and then fought featherweight.

5818
02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:52.090
He fought how much do you weight when he fought Hattaway,

5819
02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:52.890
but he fought,

5820
02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:53.340
um,

5821
02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:55.340
who's probably one 90 something here.

5822
02:47:55.850 --> 02:47:56.271
Maybe.

5823
02:47:56.271 --> 02:47:57.740
Maybe it was a little bit heavier than that,

5824
02:47:57.741 --> 02:48:01.220
but when he fought Leo Machida Machida was over two oh five.

5825
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:03.140
So Machida was tactically heavyweight.

5826
02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:03.830
Crazy.

5827
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:04.250
Yeah,

5828
02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:05.690
I dunno what Machida wage does.

5829
02:48:05.691 --> 02:48:06.420
Not Tall.

5830
02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:06.940
I mean he's,

5831
02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:07.120
no,

5832
02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:07.880
it's short.

5833
02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:09.530
It's a fucking animal though in its best.

5834
02:48:09.531 --> 02:48:10.001
And his prime,

5835
02:48:10.001 --> 02:48:10.880
he was a fucking animal.

5836
02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:11.750
Um,

5837
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:16.220
but I think that he's probably the biggest example of a,

5838
02:48:16.221 --> 02:48:18.200
of a high level guy that's fought.

5839
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:22.460
I mean obviously Machita went on to be the light heavyweight champion and is a

5840
02:48:22.461 --> 02:48:24.050
contender right now in the middle weight division.

5841
02:48:24.051 --> 02:48:25.730
And Bj just fought as a featherweight,

5842
02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.080
so it's fucking,

5843
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:28.700
he's got the most drastic changes.

5844
02:48:28.770 --> 02:48:31.940
Any follow up as to like a lot of people are really surprised by when he was

5845
02:48:31.941 --> 02:48:32.570
fighting frank,

5846
02:48:32.570 --> 02:48:34.010
Frankie Edgar and his last fight,

5847
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.581
he,

5848
02:48:34.581 --> 02:48:37.130
his feet were so close to getting her and he's on his toes.

5849
02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:38.180
It was very strange.

5850
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.720
Yeah.

5851
02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:39.553
Was there,

5852
02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:40.873
was there ever,

5853
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:43.580
was that ever addressed by them or by anybody else?

5854
02:48:43.610 --> 02:48:43.791
Yeah,

5855
02:48:43.791 --> 02:48:47.840
he said he was trying to conserve energy and then he decided that that was a

5856
02:48:47.841 --> 02:48:49.220
stance that he was going to adopt because,

5857
02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:52.850
and keeping his legs wide and like pushing off with his legs,

5858
02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:54.620
that it would require too much energy.

5859
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:56.540
He's always had a problem with stamina,

5860
02:48:56.810 --> 02:48:57.140
you know,

5861
02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:57.411
that's,

5862
02:48:57.411 --> 02:48:58.940
that's been his problem and he was,

5863
02:48:58.970 --> 02:49:02.390
he was ferocious in the first round of the second fight with Matt Hughes or the

5864
02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:03.580
third fight sacrament.

5865
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.990
Yeah,

5866
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:05.900
we were fighting last second fight,

5867
02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:06.391
third fight.

5868
02:49:06.391 --> 02:49:06.841
He knocked him out.

5869
02:49:06.841 --> 02:49:07.460
He was out.

5870
02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:10.710
It was ferocious in the first round and then ran out of gas in a second.

5871
02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:10.950
Matt.

5872
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:12.990
He started beating them down the second round and it was,

5873
02:49:12.991 --> 02:49:14.310
cause Matt Hughes was in better shape.

5874
02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:17.760
Bj at his best was when he was training with the Marinovich is because,

5875
02:49:18.010 --> 02:49:18.390
uh,

5876
02:49:18.390 --> 02:49:20.520
Marinovich has we're fucking animals.

5877
02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:23.580
When it came to strength and conditioning and they got him in unbelievable

5878
02:49:23.581 --> 02:49:24.300
shape.

5879
02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.250
He was just shredded.

5880
02:49:25.251 --> 02:49:27.690
He had abs is finding 155 pounds.

5881
02:49:27.691 --> 02:49:31.410
He was strong and like when he beat Joe Stevenson,

5882
02:49:31.411 --> 02:49:34.950
when he beat a Diego Sanchez at 155 pounds,

5883
02:49:34.951 --> 02:49:36.060
he was the best.

5884
02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:39.450
He was at his best and he was just in incredible shape.

5885
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:40.980
He was a monster there,

5886
02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:42.000
but it was conditioning.

5887
02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:42.781
Just,

5888
02:49:42.781 --> 02:49:43.260
you know,

5889
02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:44.093
lives a good life.

5890
02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:44.881
It lives in Hawaii.

5891
02:49:44.881 --> 02:49:45.930
He's got plenty of money.

5892
02:49:45.931 --> 02:49:46.980
He's a hero.

5893
02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:48.600
He goes to Hawaii everywhere he goes.

5894
02:49:48.601 --> 02:49:50.420
Bj is awesome.

5895
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:51.230
They love him.

5896
02:49:51.230 --> 02:49:56.230
It was very difficult for a guy that lives in silk sheets to get up and go to

5897
02:49:56.611 --> 02:49:57.444
war every day.

5898
02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:59.310
That's the reality of life.

5899
02:49:59.340 --> 02:49:59.580
Yeah,

5900
02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:04.260
it's hard and really loved guy who also is supreme.

5901
02:50:04.261 --> 02:50:06.600
Lee physically talented and people don't know that.

5902
02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:09.210
He's a prime to Jay that nicknamed the prodigy.

5903
02:50:09.210 --> 02:50:13.470
It came because he won the world championships after three years of training in

5904
02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:14.280
Jujitsu.

5905
02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.570
But I've heard other fighters like Eve Edwards in those guys tell me that they'd

5906
02:50:18.571 --> 02:50:20.670
never seen anybody pick up a technique that quickly.

5907
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:22.050
So when you're an MMA fighter,

5908
02:50:22.110 --> 02:50:23.550
you know like picking up a technique,

5909
02:50:23.551 --> 02:50:24.361
whatever it might be,

5910
02:50:24.361 --> 02:50:24.900
it takes a while.

5911
02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:25.561
You got to drill,

5912
02:50:25.561 --> 02:50:26.580
it takes a long time.

5913
02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:26.741
It's,

5914
02:50:26.741 --> 02:50:26.970
and that's,

5915
02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:28.430
it can take up to a year or you know,

5916
02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:28.981
four months,

5917
02:50:28.981 --> 02:50:31.050
five months that Duke could see it twice.

5918
02:50:31.051 --> 02:50:32.460
And it was part of his repertoire.

5919
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:33.383
Well he was,

5920
02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:35.370
I don't want to say he was a natural fighter,

5921
02:50:35.371 --> 02:50:39.150
but that was something that he had a lot of passion for and he was very focused

5922
02:50:39.151 --> 02:50:39.601
about it.

5923
02:50:39.601 --> 02:50:40.434
And it came,

5924
02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:41.820
it came pretty quickly to them.

5925
02:50:42.270 --> 02:50:46.490
But there's a lot other guys that have a slowly dropped weight and McVie tore,

5926
02:50:46.530 --> 02:50:51.530
fought as heavy as 240 at one point in his career when he fought Randy coture,

5927
02:50:51.571 --> 02:50:56.010
I think he was like two 40 something and now he's much thinner now.

5928
02:50:56.010 --> 02:50:56.430
Man,

5929
02:50:56.430 --> 02:50:57.000
he's,

5930
02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.530
now that he's off the TRT,

5931
02:50:58.980 --> 02:50:59.341
he,

5932
02:50:59.341 --> 02:50:59.611
you know,

5933
02:50:59.611 --> 02:51:01.200
he's really looking thin.

5934
02:51:01.230 --> 02:51:04.980
It's just like there's been a lot of people that is frame was like one 80.

5935
02:51:04.981 --> 02:51:06.720
I mean if you look at his hands and feet,

5936
02:51:06.721 --> 02:51:07.554
they're not big.

5937
02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:07.920
No.

5938
02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:10.290
Well there's a lot of people that think you can make welterweight weight,

5939
02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:12.940
especially now that he's off TRD then yeah,

5940
02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:15.600
there's videos of him working out.

5941
02:51:15.601 --> 02:51:18.210
There's a recent video on his Instagram and uh,

5942
02:51:18.211 --> 02:51:19.260
it went on the underground.

5943
02:51:19.290 --> 02:51:20.820
Like people were looking at it and they're like,

5944
02:51:20.821 --> 02:51:21.301
seriously,

5945
02:51:21.301 --> 02:51:22.134
I'm not bullshitting.

5946
02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.630
I think he could be a welterweight.

5947
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:25.590
And we look at some welterweights like,

5948
02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:26.550
okay,

5949
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:27.630
here's the perfect example,

5950
02:51:27.660 --> 02:51:28.411
Carlos condit,

5951
02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:29.430
he's a big boy,

5952
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:30.300
you know,

5953
02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:31.290
look at some of the gods.

5954
02:51:31.291 --> 02:51:31.441
Like,

5955
02:51:31.441 --> 02:51:31.860
okay,

5956
02:51:31.860 --> 02:51:32.730
Tyron Woodley,

5957
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:35.430
Tyrone Woodley is up big fucking guy.

5958
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:37.110
He's a shit.

5959
02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:39.000
And he manages to get down to one 70.

5960
02:51:39.270 --> 02:51:43.440
Vito doesn't look that big and not now what is I'm Carlos condit way you think

5961
02:51:43.441 --> 02:51:44.274
on the off season,

5962
02:51:44.430 --> 02:51:48.930
he's probably bordering the nineties like gets around one 90 close to it.

5963
02:51:48.931 --> 02:51:49.681
15 pounds,

5964
02:51:49.681 --> 02:51:50.940
20 pounds over the weight limit.

5965
02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:51.840
Handsome kid too.

5966
02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:52.770
Good looking guy.

5967
02:51:52.770 --> 02:51:53.603
Yeah,

5968
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.911
he's,

5969
02:51:53.911 --> 02:51:55.590
I'm recovering from knee surgery.

5970
02:51:55.650 --> 02:51:57.000
Tore his ACL against Woodley.

5971
02:51:57.001 --> 02:51:57.834
So damn good.

5972
02:51:57.930 --> 02:51:59.850
Carlos condit is just so good.

5973
02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:00.420
Yeah.

5974
02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:02.130
Talk about conditioning and that doodle fight,

5975
02:52:02.131 --> 02:52:05.470
a five round fight or I don't know if he had had to funnel five rounder.

5976
02:52:05.890 --> 02:52:06.400
Yes.

5977
02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:06.580
Yay.

5978
02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:08.860
Fought GSP is a five round fight and you know,

5979
02:52:08.861 --> 02:52:09.401
he just,

5980
02:52:09.401 --> 02:52:12.910
he just is gone practically at the same pace.

5981
02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:16.480
We were watching Rory Macdonald knocked out tax happening this week and we were

5982
02:52:16.481 --> 02:52:17.680
watching the highlights of it.

5983
02:52:17.681 --> 02:52:18.514
Robin,

5984
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:19.690
my friend Robin Black,

5985
02:52:19.691 --> 02:52:21.040
we'll also has been on the podcast,

5986
02:52:21.041 --> 02:52:22.840
did a breakdown of it and uh,

5987
02:52:22.841 --> 02:52:26.320
he did an awesome breakdown of it and really highlighted some of the,

5988
02:52:26.321 --> 02:52:26.800
uh,

5989
02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:31.120
the things that Rory did really well in that fight and things at Safa.

5990
02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:33.090
Nene did to try to like throw Roy off.

5991
02:52:33.091 --> 02:52:33.924
It didn't work.

5992
02:52:34.390 --> 02:52:36.970
But I'm Rory Macdonald's another one at one 70.

5993
02:52:36.971 --> 02:52:38.140
That's fucking terrifying.

5994
02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:39.280
And the interesting,

5995
02:52:39.281 --> 02:52:40.001
interesting guy,

5996
02:52:40.001 --> 02:52:40.630
man,

5997
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:41.021
you know,

5998
02:52:41.021 --> 02:52:45.090
it was training with GSP for a long time and then as they got further along in

5999
02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:45.850
their career,

6000
02:52:45.850 --> 02:52:49.920
it started getting the talk about like these guys I'd eventually fight now that

6001
02:52:49.921 --> 02:52:53.290
GSPs retired and he's like one of the number one contenders now.

6002
02:52:53.380 --> 02:52:54.070
He's,

6003
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:56.530
that was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.

6004
02:52:56.650 --> 02:52:56.861
The,

6005
02:52:56.861 --> 02:52:57.220
his,

6006
02:52:57.220 --> 02:52:59.980
his ability to stand there with Saffie and it's feed him at his own game.

6007
02:52:59.981 --> 02:53:00.420
I mean,

6008
02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:01.330
real beautiful.

6009
02:53:01.430 --> 02:53:02.530
It's just incredible.

6010
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.891
I mean,

6011
02:53:02.891 --> 02:53:03.760
you look at what Safa Dean,

6012
02:53:03.761 --> 02:53:07.420
when Stephanie and fight fought Nate Marquardt how well he did against Mark

6013
02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:09.490
Clark and then see Rory pick them apart like that.

6014
02:53:09.610 --> 02:53:10.330
It's incredible.

6015
02:53:10.330 --> 02:53:15.040
Check the leg kicks stint standing outside and delivering his own leg kicks.

6016
02:53:15.330 --> 02:53:15.830
Yup.

6017
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:16.570
Yeah.

6018
02:53:16.570 --> 02:53:17.170
Amazing.

6019
02:53:17.170 --> 02:53:18.430
And that Jab and that,

6020
02:53:18.490 --> 02:53:18.860
ah,

6021
02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:20.620
just the way he knocked him down.

6022
02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:21.600
Yeah.

6023
02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:22.500
Were always a mother fucker.

6024
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:24.070
It said it's such an exciting sport,

6025
02:53:24.310 --> 02:53:26.740
but it's another thing we were talking about in camp.

6026
02:53:27.010 --> 02:53:27.880
It was really interesting.

6027
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:29.890
We were talking about um,

6028
02:53:30.490 --> 02:53:33.310
the reality of these guys damaging themselves.

6029
02:53:33.430 --> 02:53:33.631
You know,

6030
02:53:33.631 --> 02:53:37.690
like Brian and I were at the airport yesterday in Seattle and we were watching a

6031
02:53:37.691 --> 02:53:40.270
football game and we don't particularly watch football that often.

6032
02:53:40.271 --> 02:53:41.080
So we're watching it,

6033
02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:42.010
which is all,

6034
02:53:42.011 --> 02:53:44.800
I could see what these guys heads colliding.

6035
02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:48.700
That's just tunc those helmets colliding with each other.

6036
02:53:48.701 --> 02:53:52.780
And all I could think about was that recent NFL study that showed that 76% of

6037
02:53:52.781 --> 02:53:57.781
deceased NFL player 76 at a 79 had brain injuries like significant 7,679 brains

6038
02:53:59.831 --> 02:54:00.311
they studied,

6039
02:54:00.311 --> 02:54:01.570
had to sit down and brain injury.

6040
02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:03.370
Significant brain damage.

6041
02:54:03.430 --> 02:54:04.900
Well then you're starting to see it.

6042
02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:09.460
You see Tony Doerr set and you see these guys try Montana trying to talk really

6043
02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:10.270
seven.

6044
02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:10.571
Yeah,

6045
02:54:10.571 --> 02:54:11.920
he's having issues with his memory.

6046
02:54:12.570 --> 02:54:13.060
Um,

6047
02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:13.421
uh,

6048
02:54:13.421 --> 02:54:14.530
what's the fucking guy?

6049
02:54:15.350 --> 02:54:15.651
Yeah,

6050
02:54:15.651 --> 02:54:17.140
Brett Farve was having real issues,

6051
02:54:17.141 --> 02:54:17.910
right?

6052
02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:18.161
Um,

6053
02:54:18.161 --> 02:54:18.431
well he,

6054
02:54:18.431 --> 02:54:19.720
it was Brett Farve never took a day.

6055
02:54:19.730 --> 02:54:20.110
I mean,

6056
02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:21.820
Brett Farve had the longest run.

6057
02:54:21.821 --> 02:54:22.001
I mean,

6058
02:54:22.001 --> 02:54:23.080
he was the iron man.

6059
02:54:23.081 --> 02:54:23.261
I mean,

6060
02:54:23.261 --> 02:54:23.801
he was fighting.

6061
02:54:23.801 --> 02:54:26.470
He was getting knocked on his ass by the biggest,

6062
02:54:26.471 --> 02:54:26.981
toughest guys.

6063
02:54:26.981 --> 02:54:27.880
Never broke a bone.

6064
02:54:27.881 --> 02:54:28.070
I mean,

6065
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.510
he's just,

6066
02:54:28.510 --> 02:54:30.720
the superman got addicted to painkillers,

6067
02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:31.720
I believe for a while.

6068
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:33.520
That has no surprise.

6069
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:33.910
I mean,

6070
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:37.120
that guy put himself through punishment.

6071
02:54:37.121 --> 02:54:39.370
Like no football player I've ever seen.

6072
02:54:39.371 --> 02:54:39.551
I mean,

6073
02:54:39.551 --> 02:54:42.490
he was the guy from Chicago bears from the 80s.

6074
02:54:42.850 --> 02:54:43.590
Uh,

6075
02:54:43.590 --> 02:54:44.230
Julia Mann,

6076
02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:45.030
Jim Mcmahon,

6077
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:45.300
Cim.

6078
02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:46.870
Mcmahon's got some serious issues.

6079
02:54:46.871 --> 02:54:47.530
Now,

6080
02:54:47.530 --> 02:54:50.890
and he talks about how sometimes it'd be in his house and have no idea what he

6081
02:54:50.891 --> 02:54:52.450
was about to do or where he's going.

6082
02:54:52.810 --> 02:54:53.081
He knows.

6083
02:54:53.081 --> 02:54:54.220
He just doesn't know what he's doing.

6084
02:54:54.221 --> 02:54:55.090
He's just standing there like,

6085
02:54:55.091 --> 02:54:55.924
what am I doing?

6086
02:54:56.470 --> 02:54:56.801
Yeah.

6087
02:54:56.801 --> 02:55:00.220
And he was a on a sports radio show and he was talking about it in depth.

6088
02:55:00.221 --> 02:55:01.570
It was a cover of sports illustrated,

6089
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:03.290
him and his issues.

6090
02:55:03.350 --> 02:55:04.490
It's soured me to the game.

6091
02:55:04.491 --> 02:55:05.121
I'll be honest with you.

6092
02:55:05.121 --> 02:55:07.430
I used to watch football all the time and the more I learn,

6093
02:55:07.431 --> 02:55:07.880
I'm like,

6094
02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:08.300
ma'am,

6095
02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:09.090
I don't really want to some,

6096
02:55:09.090 --> 02:55:09.730
I dunno.

6097
02:55:09.730 --> 02:55:10.580
What about MMA?

6098
02:55:11.290 --> 02:55:12.123
Um,

6099
02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:13.753
because look,

6100
02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:14.660
let's be realistic.

6101
02:55:14.661 --> 02:55:15.530
I feel like it's not as,

6102
02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:15.880
uh,

6103
02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:16.940
it's that I feel like,

6104
02:55:16.941 --> 02:55:18.290
and it's changing because the training,

6105
02:55:18.291 --> 02:55:20.510
but I feel like that head trauma isn't a sustain.

6106
02:55:20.530 --> 02:55:22.510
It isn't like football or boxing.

6107
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:23.383
Am I wrong?

6108
02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:23.990
Yes.

6109
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.410
Okay.

6110
02:55:24.410 --> 02:55:24.681
Yeah,

6111
02:55:24.681 --> 02:55:24.921
no,

6112
02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:25.121
it's,

6113
02:55:25.121 --> 02:55:25.401
it's,

6114
02:55:25.401 --> 02:55:25.820
um,

6115
02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:28.700
especially because so much emphasis is on stand up these days.

6116
02:55:28.701 --> 02:55:29.990
And it used to be,

6117
02:55:30.300 --> 02:55:32.150
there was a recent Andrew interview,

6118
02:55:32.151 --> 02:55:32.690
um,

6119
02:55:32.690 --> 02:55:33.523
with um,

6120
02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:36.200
Dan Hardee and Dan Hardee was talking about,

6121
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:37.063
uh,

6122
02:55:37.330 --> 02:55:37.610
you know,

6123
02:55:37.610 --> 02:55:39.050
Dan had a heart condition,

6124
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.960
not a real heart,

6125
02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:44.120
a very controversial situation where he's very fit and healthy,

6126
02:55:44.330 --> 02:55:47.270
but he has like an extra heartbeats something wolf condition.

6127
02:55:47.270 --> 02:55:48.103
I forgot what it's called,

6128
02:55:48.470 --> 02:55:52.670
but he was talking about how when he was fighting it was a lot of wrestlers that

6129
02:55:52.671 --> 02:55:54.380
were dominating the 170 pound division.

6130
02:55:54.381 --> 02:55:55.910
And now there's a lot of kickboxers.

6131
02:55:56.120 --> 02:55:57.380
Now you've got Roy McDonald,

6132
02:55:57.381 --> 02:55:58.214
now you got,

6133
02:55:58.280 --> 02:55:58.520
you know,

6134
02:55:58.520 --> 02:55:59.390
Robbie Lawler,

6135
02:55:59.391 --> 02:56:02.300
you've got a lot of strikers wound up strikers,

6136
02:56:03.230 --> 02:56:04.063
bombs.

6137
02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:06.230
Well guys who can wrestle and it can do all those things,

6138
02:56:06.231 --> 02:56:10.550
but a lot of kickboxing techniques are starting to dominate these contests.

6139
02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:13.070
And when you're training a lot of kickboxing,

6140
02:56:13.071 --> 02:56:14.450
you've got a lot of head injuries.

6141
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:18.380
There's a lot of head trauma that's going on both in training and in fights.

6142
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:19.340
It's always changing too.

6143
02:56:19.341 --> 02:56:19.531
I mean,

6144
02:56:19.531 --> 02:56:19.631
I,

6145
02:56:19.631 --> 02:56:23.110
I've never seen the block that Rory Macdonald was using that high elbow bladders

6146
02:56:23.130 --> 02:56:24.230
seen that very smart,

6147
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:24.901
very well.

6148
02:56:24.901 --> 02:56:27.980
It's very smart to avoid strikes to the head,

6149
02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:30.530
especially if you know that a guy is throwing head punches,

6150
02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:31.371
you know,

6151
02:56:31.371 --> 02:56:32.780
and a lot of these guys,

6152
02:56:32.970 --> 02:56:33.230
they're,

6153
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:38.230
they're not throwing the type of like really long form combinations that you

6154
02:56:38.391 --> 02:56:42.770
will see high level Moitai or high level Dutch kickboxers throw the throwing one

6155
02:56:42.771 --> 02:56:43.604
or two techniques.

6156
02:56:43.820 --> 02:56:46.030
And a lot of it is because you're worried about takedowns you're,

6157
02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:49.880
what we're seeing is just an evolution of the game we're seeing seeing the sport

6158
02:56:49.881 --> 02:56:50.600
evolve.

6159
02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:51.140
I love it.

6160
02:56:51.140 --> 02:56:51.351
I mean,

6161
02:56:51.351 --> 02:56:52.190
I'm a huge fan,

6162
02:56:52.191 --> 02:56:53.810
but it concerns me.

6163
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:55.370
Brain damage is a very,

6164
02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:55.970
very,

6165
02:56:55.970 --> 02:56:56.570
uh,

6166
02:56:56.570 --> 02:56:59.000
it's a very real thing and there's no turning back.

6167
02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:00.560
That's what bugs me the most.

6168
02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:02.300
You could go get me out on

6169
02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:04.970
bigger gloves.

6170
02:57:04.971 --> 02:57:05.270
I mean,

6171
02:57:05.270 --> 02:57:05.571
no,

6172
02:57:05.571 --> 02:57:07.640
that's not going to help that I might even hurt actually.

6173
02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:10.130
The solution might actually be no gloves.

6174
02:57:10.490 --> 02:57:13.070
That might be a better solution when it comes to head trauma because you can't

6175
02:57:13.071 --> 02:57:14.570
hit his heart without breaking your hands.

6176
02:57:14.571 --> 02:57:17.120
You have to be much more selective in your punch placement.

6177
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:18.920
You go out faster in a weird way too,

6178
02:57:18.921 --> 02:57:19.190
right?

6179
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.940
I mean,

6180
02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:20.331
well,

6181
02:57:20.331 --> 02:57:21.230
I don't know about that.

6182
02:57:21.231 --> 02:57:24.950
I think you probably go out harder and faster with the UFC gloves because they

6183
02:57:24.951 --> 02:57:25.790
pad your knuckles.

6184
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:28.370
He could punch harder and you're also,

6185
02:57:28.371 --> 02:57:29.540
you're supporting the wrist,

6186
02:57:29.541 --> 02:57:30.740
you taping the risks down.

6187
02:57:30.980 --> 02:57:34.610
I think realistically you shouldn't be able to tape your wrists.

6188
02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:37.910
He should be able to take your hands and I think that would probably be one of

6189
02:57:37.911 --> 02:57:40.220
the best ways to protect against head trauma.

6190
02:57:40.250 --> 02:57:40.701
Still though,

6191
02:57:40.701 --> 02:57:41.091
it's like,

6192
02:57:41.091 --> 02:57:41.361
you know,

6193
02:57:41.361 --> 02:57:42.350
you know as well as I do.

6194
02:57:42.351 --> 02:57:45.200
You put on headgear and you get hit with somebody wearing boxing gloves.

6195
02:57:45.201 --> 02:57:45.651
Your spine,

6196
02:57:45.651 --> 02:57:46.460
you get hit,

6197
02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.060
you got headgear.

6198
02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:47.930
I wear a bar,

6199
02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:48.681
they call me a pussy.

6200
02:57:48.681 --> 02:57:49.360
I got a bar.

6201
02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:52.280
Then I get hit just in the top of the head I got a headache.

6202
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.881
Why?

6203
02:57:52.881 --> 02:57:54.590
Because my head got jam back in.

6204
02:57:54.591 --> 02:57:57.080
My brain was mushed around and I was like,

6205
02:57:57.081 --> 02:57:58.190
what am I doing to even shop?

6206
02:57:58.210 --> 02:57:59.210
Brennan shop was like,

6207
02:57:59.690 --> 02:58:00.523
what are you doing?

6208
02:58:00.530 --> 02:58:01.331
You wouldn't want to do this.

6209
02:58:01.331 --> 02:58:01.990
Do you not have to fight

6210
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.550
<v 9>or you're an actor.</v>

6211
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:03.450
Why Sparring?

6212
02:58:03.451 --> 02:58:03.990
I was like,

6213
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.111
oh,

6214
02:58:04.111 --> 02:58:04.800
I don't know.

6215
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:05.710
Cause you're wanting to do it.

6216
02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:06.553
He is.

6217
02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:08.221
He's like,

6218
02:58:08.221 --> 02:58:10.230
he literally wouldn't when an MMA fighter and he's,

6219
02:58:10.231 --> 02:58:11.070
your friend comes up and goes,

6220
02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:11.990
do you don't,

6221
02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:12.870
what are you doing?

6222
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:13.890
You don't need to do this.

6223
02:58:13.891 --> 02:58:14.760
Maybe you should stop.

6224
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.020
Oh you mean I'm 47?

6225
02:58:16.050 --> 02:58:16.261
Yeah.

6226
02:58:16.261 --> 02:58:16.860
Okay.

6227
02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:17.400
I think I will.

6228
02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:17.701
Well,

6229
02:58:17.701 --> 02:58:20.750
you should go see Brian Cowen and see this idiot inaction.

6230
02:58:20.810 --> 02:58:21.643
Hey,

6231
02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:23.130
see it at its best.

6232
02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:25.390
<v 3>Tobar 16,</v>

6233
02:58:25.391 --> 02:58:29.730
17 and 18 at the Atlanta Improv and uh,

6234
02:58:30.100 --> 02:58:30.491
yeah,

6235
02:58:30.491 --> 02:58:31.121
it would be awesome.

6236
02:58:31.121 --> 02:58:31.954
Do you know his work?

6237
02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:33.730
<v 9>Leo Flowers?</v>

6238
02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:38.270
A really funny comic coming down the future for me and uh,

6239
02:58:38.290 --> 02:58:39.430
I'm excited to just go to Brian.

[inaudible] B r y a n Callan c a l l e n.com and a,

6244
02:58:48.241 --> 02:58:50.890
I'm at the tower theater in Philadelphia August,

6245
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:53.710
October rather 17th with Ian Edwards.

6246
02:58:53.740 --> 02:58:58.740
And I'm at the Warner Theater October 18th with Ian Edwards in Washington DC.

6247
02:58:59.140 --> 02:58:59.973
That's it.

6248
02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:01.540
Lots of podcasts this week.

6249
02:59:01.541 --> 02:59:02.261
I got honey,

6250
02:59:02.261 --> 02:59:03.094
honey.

6251
02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:06.460
Anthony Kumi is going to be here and Keith Weber as well.

6252
02:59:06.461 --> 02:59:06.761
The,

6253
02:59:06.761 --> 02:59:06.971
uh,

6254
02:59:06.971 --> 02:59:09.250
the guy from the kettle bell cardio workout that I,

6255
02:59:09.440 --> 02:59:10.870
that I talk about so much that I love,

6256
02:59:10.871 --> 02:59:11.650
he'll be here.

6257
02:59:11.650 --> 02:59:12.101
So,

6258
02:59:12.101 --> 02:59:12.550
uh,

6259
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:13.361
until then,

6260
02:59:13.361 --> 02:59:14.380
enjoy your lives,

6261
02:59:14.381 --> 02:59:15.191
my friends.

6262
02:59:15.191 --> 02:59:16.930
