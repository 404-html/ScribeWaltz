00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited to read this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed your podcast with Tim </v>

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Ferriss and I've seen you around the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of times,</v>

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know much about you,</v>

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>but you're one of those dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where I look at this guy.</v>

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy probably knows some shit.</v>

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this says something about you,</v>

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>like when I see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:34.251
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging around with lister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you a few times at the UFC in </v>

11
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I probably know some shit or he's </v>

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>seen some shit and then I saw or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to the Tim Ferriss podcast.</v>

13
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that makes a lot of sense.</v>

15
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:45.381
<v Speaker 1>Now if you haven't heard that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is excellent and you're the one of </v>

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the first guy ever to come with your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>notepad in your own pen too.</v>

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I just want to point that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to be prepared.</v>

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your whole thing,</v>

19
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of your social media posts</v>

20
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>too because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I like feeling like a lazy fuck whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at your social media posts and </v>

22
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you have a picture of your watch for 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mornings.</v>

23
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Dudes out there working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

24
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because,</v>

25
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:14.341
<v Speaker 1>obviously they had zero social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence like three months ago or </v>

27
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever the case may be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tim Ferriss was,</v>

28
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said,</v>

29
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:22.701
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get on this social media </v>

30
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:22.701
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

31
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you kind of show me what to do?</v>

32
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:28.431
<v Speaker 1>sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I signed up and then he dropped </v>

34
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:30.651
<v Speaker 1>that podcast that gets listened to by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people and all of a sudden I </v>

35
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>was engulfed in the social media world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I found twitter to be the one that,</v>

36
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:39.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the easiest to use and you don't </v>

37
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:39.591
<v Speaker 1>have to write a lot.</v>

38
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't like people that talk a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch without saying anything.</v>

40
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So I figured that one's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:50.901
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing that I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was encouraging you to use </v>

42
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>social media was like a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a peacock,</v>

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about social media</v>

44
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>as a person who's an avid social media </v>
<v Speaker 1>user,</v>

45
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>there's some peacocking to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>and I try to do it with humor and I try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

47
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an important aspect of promoting </v>

48
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>comedy shows and podcasts and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>

49
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you were much more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep it to yourself.</v>

51
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I loved about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferris podcast you were talking about,</v>

52
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you would have a commanders would </v>

53
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>come to a various leaders and ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need,</v>

54
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>what do you need a and guys would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these requests and all these things.</v>

55
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>We need Wifi and we need this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were like,</v>

56
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>we're good sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good sir.</v>

57
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind that is when you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>need something,</v>

58
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>if you really did need something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would come to you,</v>

59
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you would get it quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

60
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:48.201
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I needed something and I spoke up </v>

61
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:48.201
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

62
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>hey boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I need and this is why I </v>

63
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.581
<v Speaker 1>need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would instantly give it to me </v>

64
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>because they knew that I was telling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth that it wasn't some,</v>

65
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>halfassed requests that wasn't real.</v>

66
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It was something that we legit needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd give it to me.</v>

67
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the value</v>

68
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 2>of someone who keeps their words short </v>
<v Speaker 2>and means what they say and says what </v>

69
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.841
<v Speaker 2>they mean and doesn't have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit involved in their vocabulary.</v>

70
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.881
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is coming from a professional </v>

71
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:14.881
<v Speaker 2>bullshitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:14.881
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bullshit.</v>

73
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>fill a lot of hours of just shooting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit about nonsense.</v>

75
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I have to look in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 2>at myself.</v>

76
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote with my partner Leif Babin,</v>

77
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>who I served with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

78
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 2>we just wrote a 300 page book about us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 2>for all practical purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now of course it's about our team and </v>

80
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 2>it's about what we learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we experienced.</v>

81
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>But there's no doubt that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of,</v>

82
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self promotion when you're writing a </v>

83
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 2>book that's got your name on the cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

84
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm sitting here talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess that puts me in the same </v>

85
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not the same league,</v>

86
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but at least I'm playing the same sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

87
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely playing the same sport </v>
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>

88
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 1>But there's benefit to that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think what you have to say and </v>

89
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>especially what you had to say in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss podcast is,</v>

90
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.750
<v Speaker 1>is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

91
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just important.</v>

92
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:06.841
<v Speaker 1>It's unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because your perspective is of one </v>

93
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:09.960
<v Speaker 1>who was involved in the most intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

94
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>a human being can participate in today's</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

95
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You were involved in combat in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the worst time of the war and you</v>

96
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:24.391
<v Speaker 1>came through it with some pretty intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons and you can.</v>

97
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody listening to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast can get a lot out of it.</v>

98
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>There's inspiration to be gotten from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that podcast for sure.</v>

99
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>But there's also an understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only be.</v>

100
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody else can relay </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you experienced,</v>

101
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:49.711
<v Speaker 1>you can have all these guys that write </v>
<v Speaker 1>these movies and they could write </v>

103
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:52.440
<v Speaker 1>screenplays and television shows about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or guys can write books about it.</v>

104
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Embedded journalists can write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>

105
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a sense from just you talking </v>

106
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.131
<v Speaker 1>about it on Tim Ferriss' podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally a shift in my perspective of </v>

107
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be there.</v>

108
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

109
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my,</v>

110
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 2>and I know this might sound weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was my lifelong dream to be in </v>

111
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 2>combat and to be in a leadership </v>
<v Speaker 2>position in combat.</v>

112
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Ever since I could remember wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything of any substance with my </v>

113
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:35.031
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be some kind of a commando </v>

114
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:37.350
<v Speaker 2>and so I really felt and the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ramadi was,</v>

115
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said it was 2006.</v>

116
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 2>There was Ramadi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq.</v>

117
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:46.191
<v Speaker 2>It was the worst place in the world at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and I knew that and I felt like</v>

118
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:52.161
<v Speaker 2>my whole life had sort of been preparing</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to be there in that position.</v>

119
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Taking care of those guys to the best of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ability and going out and sending </v>

120
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.741
<v Speaker 2>them out to go and kill the enemy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting the conventional forces that </v>

121
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.871
<v Speaker 2>were there that were unbelievably brave </v>
<v Speaker 2>and humble and just miraculously </v>

122
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 2>patriotic and we formed a brotherhood </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

123
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day I don't think it'll ever be </v>

124
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>replaced and you can see why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.950
<v Speaker 2>these stories of war stand the test of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and when we talk about the </v>

126
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:29.081
<v Speaker 2>Peloponnesian wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about war for all time because </v>

127
00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something there and I think it's</v>

128
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>what you began with because it is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate human test.</v>

129
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the ultimate.</v>

130
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>It is other people are trying to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're trying to kill them and </v>

131
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.031
<v Speaker 2>that's just the ultimate test and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a great test or a test that </v>

132
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:52.301
<v Speaker 2>everyone should want to have happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's awful and horrible and </v>

133
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.980
<v Speaker 2>wretched in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it's there and it's</v>

134
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>present and there is no avoiding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no avoiding it.</v>

135
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 2>War is part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of human nature.</v>

136
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I know Dana White says fighting's in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>DNA,</v>

137
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 2>well you don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one or two degrees further from fist</v>

138
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:17.561
<v Speaker 2>fighting to where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes of human beings are trying to </v>

139
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the subjects that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about with my friend Duncan.</v>

141
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.670
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going over this and we,</v>

142
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.710
<v Speaker 2>we essentially came to the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the history of the human race is a </v>

143
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>history of military warfare.</v>

144
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when are you talking about the human </v>

145
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 2>ways race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk about the civil war,</v>

146
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 2>he talk about World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war two,</v>

147
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>

148
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 2>You talk about wars and in between those</v>
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>

149
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 2>people preparing for more war or trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to avoid war,</v>

150
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>the cold war in between wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>you talk about the various conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history,</v>

152
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:54.970
<v Speaker 2>whether it's [inaudible] or whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon,</v>

153
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>whether you're talking about war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean almost all of our history has </v>

154
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.151
<v Speaker 2>been trying to keep people from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with us and trying to take things that </v>

155
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:09.641
<v Speaker 2>we think will help our people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially the history of the </v>

156
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:09.641
<v Speaker 2>human race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

157
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 2>and I think what really strikes people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and why there's a an almost sick </v>

158
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>fascination with it in some ways is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there it's,</v>

159
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we say that a combat is like life but </v>

160
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.340
<v Speaker 2>amplified and intensified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's similar to regular life except </v>

161
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 2>for the consequences are obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you know,</v>

162
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can die,</v>

163
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:38.921
<v Speaker 2>that can be the end of you and so when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in that moment and when you read </v>

164
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 2>about that and when people read these </v>
<v Speaker 2>books or watch these movies,</v>

165
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 2>they get some sense of what that must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

166
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

167
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:51.161
<v Speaker 2>some attraction to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why there's hundreds and </v>

168
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of war movies and hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of war books because people try</v>

169
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>and understand what that</v>

170
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 3>emotional content really means.</v>

171
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no higher stakes,</v>

172
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.850
<v Speaker 1>so anytime you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're involved in an activity that </v>

173
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.600
<v Speaker 1>literally there are no higher stakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the loss of your loved ones </v>

174
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>and the grief that you would suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

175
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 1>The loss of your own life is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest state possible.</v>

176
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And when I talked to people like you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the other guys that have talked </v>

177
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>to that have served and been involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat,</v>

178
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the craziest aspects of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>many want to be back there.</v>

179
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Many experience that life tuned up to 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they recall it like it's the best </v>

180
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>time of their life.</v>

181
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.300
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best time of my life,</v>

182
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.580
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>

183
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Feeling that pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

184
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 3>knowing what was at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

185
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.630
<v Speaker 3>for me in a leadership position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:47.240
<v Speaker 3>everyone feels a little bit different </v>
<v Speaker 3>from me in a leadership position.</v>

187
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.540
<v Speaker 3>You're not worried about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting hurt or killed.</v>

188
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Speaker 3>You're worried about your guys getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt or killed.</v>

189
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that's keeping you awake </v>

190
00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:58.600
<v Speaker 3>at night and the thing that's driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

191
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.970
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an intensity there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but having so much pressure and so much </v>

192
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:15.441
<v Speaker 3>at stake when it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely leaves a hollow,</v>

193
00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:20.260
<v Speaker 3>empty space inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>

194
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it with fighters,</v>

195
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.910
<v Speaker 1>with boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA fighters when they retire,</v>

196
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:30.911
<v Speaker 1>they have a real hard time finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular life to be fulfilling and I can </v>

197
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:35.990
<v Speaker 1>only imagine it would be way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense because of war,</v>

198
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:39.890
<v Speaker 1>because the thing about fighting is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a solitary sport.</v>

199
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.830
<v Speaker 1>You know you have your team behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have coaches,</v>

200
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you have guys that you prepare with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train with,</v>

201
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>but once you're locked up inside that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage or you step inside that ring,</v>

202
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>it's really all just about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experience is yours.</v>

203
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.330
<v Speaker 1>When you're a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're experience is protecting all </v>

204
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:03.110
<v Speaker 1>those around you as well as staying </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and losing friends and thinking </v>

205
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:10.151
<v Speaker 1>that you could have done something </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently and maybe someone would </v>

206
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 1>still be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

207
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a completely different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

208
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:19.510
<v Speaker 1>To leave and to come back to regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and then to watch all the </v>

209
00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:23.510
<v Speaker 1>shit that you did in Iraq go to pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

210
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>You watched just fucking chaos over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

211
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:30.821
<v Speaker 1>Now everyday in the news that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's the civil war between the </v>

212
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Sunni and the Shia or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with Isis and it just </v>

213
00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:40.061
<v Speaker 1>seems like whatever gains that you guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>made there are slowly being eroded </v>

214
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that also like pull at you?</v>

215
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

216
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.700
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't,</v>

217
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.750
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fought and when I say we,</v>

218
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about a giant group of five </v>
<v Speaker 3>or 6,000</v>

219
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:59.131
<v Speaker 3>Americans with the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One had just a huge group of awesome </v>

220
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:02.251
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers and marines and we were a part </v>

221
00:12:02.251 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 3>of them and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

222
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 3>we all fought very hard for the city of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ramadi.</v>

223
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a city,</v>

224
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a city like a city in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

225
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got roads and it's got houses and </v>

226
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Scott building and it's got a government</v>
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>

227
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.071
<v Speaker 3>It's got a soccer stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a city like what we have in </v>

228
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.211
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we went in there and fought to take </v>

229
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:25.171
<v Speaker 3>the city back from these savages that </v>
<v Speaker 3>owned it at the time.</v>

230
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 3>And why do I call them savages?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they</v>

231
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 3>tortured people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They skinned people alive.</v>

232
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 3>They beheaded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They raped little girls and little boys.</v>

233
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.440
<v Speaker 3>That was just disgusting and so we went </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there and fought against them and </v>

234
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.720
<v Speaker 3>beat them and what we did in doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the people that actually lived there.</v>

235
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.840
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a city with human beings in it </v>

236
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.030
<v Speaker 3>and I always have to tell this story or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least relate to people that you'd be </v>

237
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 3>running down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be and firing around you,</v>

238
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 3>kick open the door to a compound to </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody's house and you'd get in there </v>

239
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.890
<v Speaker 3>and there'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

240
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
<v Speaker 3>a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dad working on a car and there'd be </v>

241
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 3>two kids kicking a soccer ball and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a mom cooking lunch.</v>

242
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.260
<v Speaker 3>And so there's people there and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people wanted us to be there and wanted </v>

243
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 3>us to defeat the insurgents that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorizing them.</v>

244
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 3>And we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were joyous about that.</v>

245
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 3>And so when you talk about what do I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think now when I see isis,</v>

246
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 3>the black flag of Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

247
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:38.311
<v Speaker 3>is there any other more dramatic image?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I can tell you then that the black </v>

248
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 3>flag of Isis now flies at the government</v>
<v Speaker 3>center Amati.</v>

249
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

250
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.590
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible and it's sickening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they went around and anybody that </v>

251
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 3>had anything to do with the coalition </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

252
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.380
<v Speaker 3>they went around with a list of names </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they murdered all of them and all </v>

253
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 3>their families and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

254
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.440
<v Speaker 3>we as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of left them hanging and it's,</v>

255
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.270
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible to see that</v>

256
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.960
<v Speaker 1>we left them hanging and we instigated a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of crazy shit when we took Saddam </v>

257
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Hussein out of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was probably ultimately a good </v>

258
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.271
<v Speaker 1>thing to get rid of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was no question that he was a </v>

259
00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:23.631
<v Speaker 1>psychopath and his sons were evil fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in creating that vacuum,</v>

260
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.230
<v Speaker 1>like when the leadership has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

261
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have a responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage that area.</v>

262
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As crazy as that sounds like people want</v>

263
00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:36.500
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not in the building.</v>

264
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.360
<v Speaker 1>We're not in the business of nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

265
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not in the building process or </v>

266
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

267
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.601
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business of organizing or </v>

268
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 1>structuring a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building a democracy out of one,</v>

269
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>which did not have</v>

270
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 2>one ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you kind of have to,</v>

271
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>we'll look what we did in Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

272
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still in both those countries.</v>

273
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 2>We stayed there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guess what?</v>

274
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 2>The two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 2>what are the two economic superpowers </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind America?</v>

276
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know those two are both in the top </v>

277
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.631
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany is definitely the head of </v>

278
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:13.631
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:13.631
<v Speaker 2>besides China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Japan,</v>

280
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 2>those are economic superpowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very successful countries and we</v>

281
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:21.611
<v Speaker 2>formulated their new structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a lot of resistance in this </v>

282
00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:26.081
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There always was a lot of resistance to </v>

283
00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:28.510
<v Speaker 2>going to Iraq in the first place because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people didn't understand the connection </v>

284
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 2>between nine slash 11 and Iraq and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like it was manufactured.</v>

285
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like two people on this side </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

286
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at it and we're looking at</v>

287
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these chicken hawks that wanted us to go</v>

288
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 2>over there and why.</v>

289
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.990
<v Speaker 2>But once you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to have a different </v>

290
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:46.990
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

291
00:15:46.991 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

292
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:50.300
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a different approach.</v>

293
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to believe in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

294
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're number one and,</v>

295
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.530
<v Speaker 2>and every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every soldier or marine or service </v>

296
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 2>member will tell you that when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat,</v>

297
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.190
<v Speaker 2>they're not thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

298
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>the strategic mission of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States of America.</v>

299
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:09.041
<v Speaker 2>They're thinking about the guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to them and what they're going to </v>

300
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:09.041
<v Speaker 2>do to keep that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep their buddies alive.</v>

301
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all there is to.</v>

302
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's true in anyone will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

303
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.260
<v Speaker 2>But that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come back from that operation </v>

304
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and you have time to think about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing there,</v>

305
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 2>then you've got to believe in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

306
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't believe in what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

307
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to have some serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

308
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty obvious that what we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing was,</v>

310
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 2>was absolutely the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

311
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:34.481
<v Speaker 2>you've got insurgents there that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign fighters that want to kill </v>

312
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 2>everyone in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate us,</v>

313
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
<v Speaker 2>they want to destroy us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do nine slash 11 over and </v>

314
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.381
<v Speaker 2>over again in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill us all and so for us </v>

315
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:51.851
<v Speaker 2>to be there fighting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am totally on board and was on board </v>

316
00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:56.261
<v Speaker 2>and remain that way today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these insurgents that came in to </v>

317
00:16:56.261 --> 00:17:00.221
<v Speaker 2>these places like Ramadi and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking over the city and killing all </v>

318
00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 2>these people and torturing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

319
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Why were they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To them it's the same.</v>

320
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing that isis did when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they went back.</v>

321
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean they want to have a chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>

322
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:08.810
<v Speaker 2>At the time they.</v>

323
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 2>They'd said that Ramadi was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seat of their caliphate.</v>

324
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.070
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be the capital city of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their caliphate,</v>

325
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that that's what they were trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense like once war started over</v>

326
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became a holy war.</v>

327
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a holy war.</v>

328
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.390
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting because the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Iraq,</v>

329
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>there's people in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people in Iraq,</v>

330
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.560
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're normal people that want to have </v>

331
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 2>a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 2>build a new addition on their house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed the roof,</v>

333
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some good food for dinner that </v>

334
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.011
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised their kids so that they can take </v>

335
00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:51.011
<v Speaker 2>over the family business or that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>

336
00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 2>They're not a bunch of people running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around doing what Isis is doing.</v>

337
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 2>But who is the powerful force in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

338
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Now everyone's scared of Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

339
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.990
<v Speaker 2>and one thing about this is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

340
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:08.991
<v Speaker 2>because Iraq is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have this kind of patriotic </v>

341
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 2>feeling that we have in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I know,</v>

342
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I know it may be dying in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of Americans still </v>

343
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 2>believe America's the greatest country </v>
<v Speaker 2>on earth and that.</v>

344
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 2>And even if you don't believe it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest country on earth,</v>

345
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 2>and even if you see it for all its </v>
<v Speaker 2>faults that it's has.</v>

346
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 2>You appreciate the fact that in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country you have freedom.</v>

347
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.580
<v Speaker 2>And so you can kind of fight for that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what you're thinking about,</v>

348
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting for freedom,</v>

349
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting to protect your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

350
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.330
<v Speaker 2>in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

351
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

352
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight for whoever,</v>

353
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:45.231
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight for whoever or support </v>

354
00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:45.231
<v Speaker 2>whoever is just gonna allow me to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

355
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when Isis came into Ramadi </v>

356
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iraqi troops kind of ran away.</v>

357
00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:51.630
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

358
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really don't have that core </v>

359
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.051
<v Speaker 2>belief that they're fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's where some of the </v>

360
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 2>challenges come in and as they grow that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will,</v>

361
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 2>they will perform better.</v>

362
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 2>But it's definitely gonna take quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of time.</v>

363
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think patriotism in America was at its</v>

364
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:10.590
<v Speaker 2>all time high around September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

365
00:19:10.591 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Right after that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never saw more flags.</v>

366
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember driving down the street and </v>

367
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 2>every car had a flag hanging from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>

368
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a buddy of mine,</v>

369
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Jay London sold flags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he used to do,</v>

370
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 2>sell car flags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flags that you put on cars.</v>

371
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a good business going on for </v>

372
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.970
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a lot of things,</v>

373
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.840
<v Speaker 2>people got accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got it settled in and everything </v>

374
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:40.851
<v Speaker 2>got back down to its normal level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so was this big buzz of patriotism </v>

375
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big buzz of patriotism when </v>

376
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you feel threatened and we never feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened.</v>

377
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:52.260
<v Speaker 2>In America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is driving around in a nice big</v>

378
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:56.430
<v Speaker 2>suv that gets eight miles to the gallon </v>
<v Speaker 2>with big air conditioning blasting.</v>

379
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at their iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>texting people socially interacting </v>

380
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.040
<v Speaker 2>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Wifi,</v>

381
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 2>and they're not concerned about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>

382
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're not concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your safety,</v>

383
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 2>what is there left to be patriotic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you don't understand what it means </v>

384
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 2>to live in fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

385
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.270
<v Speaker 2>September 11th comes and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked and you feel that fear.</v>

386
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You rally around this,</v>

387
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 2>this thing America that's protected you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your family,</v>

388
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't even think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

389
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 2>but now you're thinking about it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

390
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:29.001
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put a flag up on my up on </v>

391
00:20:29.001 --> 00:20:31.191
<v Speaker 2>my vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This vehicle that I drive around in </v>

392
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:31.191
<v Speaker 2>complete luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what America is like,</v>

393
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 2>America is unbelievably luxurious </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to the rest of the world.</v>

394
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>There's also unquestionable evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in flying planes into buildings</v>

395
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:44.541
<v Speaker 2>and killing civilians just randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haphazardly suicide bombing essentially </v>

396
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:50.301
<v Speaker 2>with a plane right into a building or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal that was so evil that everybody </v>

397
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:50.301
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

398
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 2>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no gray area in that.</v>

399
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about as clear as any event ever </v>

400
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.480
<v Speaker 2>in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agree.</v>

401
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Now when you found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you already involved in the </v>

402
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 2>military when all this was going on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you signed up like long before they like</v>

403
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:13.471
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's anybody that I've ever met </v>

404
00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:13.471
<v Speaker 2>that I've ever heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

405
00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean this is how you feel.</v>

406
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 2>You're born for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

407
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 2>This is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

408
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.450
<v Speaker 2>your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your post in life?</v>

409
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What put.</v>

410
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.220
<v Speaker 2>What pulled you into them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You grew up in New England?</v>

411
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I did what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of Connecticut and Maine.</v>

412
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just sticks on a dirt road,</v>

413
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:33.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of a general American,</v>

414
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 2>general American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it,</v>

415
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 2>the true you to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where did you develop this sense of</v>

416
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 2>patriotism?</v>

417
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say prior to the,</v>

418
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

420
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.850
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to be some kind of a </v>

421
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:53.850
<v Speaker 2>commando and I would say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you joined the military,</v>

422
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd say people that are somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriotic join the military,</v>

423
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>but when you travel around the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the military,</v>

424
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.680
<v Speaker 2>that kind of confirms your patriotism </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than anything else because you see </v>

425
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.951
<v Speaker 2>what the rest of the world is like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how unbelievably amazing America is.</v>

426
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does America have faults?</v>

427
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's got all kinds of faults.</v>

428
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:18.631
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do better and there's things that </v>

429
00:22:18.631 --> 00:22:21.181
<v Speaker 2>we've done in the past that we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have done and there's things that we'll </v>

430
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:21.181
<v Speaker 2>do in the future that we shouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

431
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but when you compare that with the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world and how the rest of the </v>

432
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.810
<v Speaker 2>world lives and what it means to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an oppressed society,</v>

433
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

434
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you're extremely thankful to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

435
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.770
<v Speaker 2>This is once you've already been in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military and already started trout.</v>

436
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 2>So this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just had this draw towards it almost</v>

437
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 2>like your destiny to be in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

438
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.690
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strange that it just came out of </v>

439
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.791
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was no like event in your </v>

440
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:53.281
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed like this was just </v>

441
00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:53.281
<v Speaker 2>something that it was always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were always attracted to.</v>

442
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running around the woods as a little kid</v>

443
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.870
<v Speaker 2>with bb guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting each other.</v>

444
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And that seemed like a good job.</v>

445
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't seal teams,</v>

446
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't grow up,</v>

447
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

448
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 2>you continue with your childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

449
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play time for your whole adult life and </v>

450
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that's the best thing about the seal </v>
<v Speaker 2>teams is you,</v>

452
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>you get to do what you always wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and they pay you money and you get </v>

453
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 2>unlimited ammunition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably types of weapons,</v>

454
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 2>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosives,</v>

455
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 2>no grenades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just give it all to you.</v>

456
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

457
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>they get excited when they find a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you.</v>

458
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.310
<v Speaker 2>We've got here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got a smart guy who was born to do </v>

459
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.310
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's really looking forward to it.</v>

460
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

461
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure the recruiter was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired up when he met.</v>

462
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I would be,</v>

463
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>if I was recruited out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me sign the paper,</v>

464
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 1>got one check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check the boxes.</v>

465
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

466
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even more intense because it's not </v>

467
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>just you get to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only the strong get to play.</v>

468
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.720
<v Speaker 1>The week Oregon we weeded out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's left is people have similar </v>

469
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:08.240
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I've found most fascinating.</v>

470
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so romantic in the public's eye about </v>

471
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the seals or green berets </v>
<v Speaker 1>are rangers people that it's very </v>

472
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.631
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get in there and only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>select few have the intestinal </v>

473
00:24:22.631 --> 00:24:27.071
<v Speaker 1>fortitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the willpower and the ability to lock </v>

474
00:24:27.071 --> 00:24:28.580
<v Speaker 1>onto a task and a goal and get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

475
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

476
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>and then when you're in the seal teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that means anything and like all</v>

477
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:40.121
<v Speaker 3>the training and all that selection </v>
<v Speaker 3>process is just doesn't mean anything </v>

478
00:24:40.121 --> 00:24:43.721
<v Speaker 3>because you all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a baseline of where </v>

479
00:24:43.721 --> 00:24:45.851
<v Speaker 3>everyone's at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when people talk about this </v>

480
00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:45.851
<v Speaker 3>intense training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the seal teams,</v>

481
00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:47.930
<v Speaker 3>you don't talk about that training that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go through to get an it.</v>

482
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.190
<v Speaker 3>That's just the baseline for everybody.</v>

483
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's just to make sure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a pussy just exactly.</v>

484
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you are,</v>

485
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.830
<v Speaker 1>44 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still getting up at 4:00</v>

486
00:24:56.831 --> 00:25:01.030
<v Speaker 1>in the morning doing dead lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never left you.</v>

487
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It did not leave me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to.</v>

488
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:07.690
<v Speaker 1>His aid is not going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get through.</v>

489
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Once you get through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intensity of buds and you get </v>

490
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.450
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:16.960
<v Speaker 1>all the people that are going to quit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get through all the training,</v>

492
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 1>what is life like from there on out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how structured is like training and</v>

493
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>physical activity and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>from there on out,</v>

494
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

495
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.880
<v Speaker 1>being in the seal teams is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is awesome.</v>

496
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a</v>

497
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.730
<v Speaker 3>fun job that I literally didn't consider</v>
<v Speaker 3>it a job except for maybe 13 months out </v>

498
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 3>of my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 months I worked for,</v>

499
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the directly for the animal that was in </v>

500
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.611
<v Speaker 3>charge of all the seals and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great guy and I learned a ton </v>

501
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:52.010
<v Speaker 3>from him and from having that job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't a fun job.</v>

502
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And even he would tell you it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun job.</v>

503
00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:54.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to uh,</v>

504
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing a uniform every day and </v>

505
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.871
<v Speaker 3>in the regular seal teams you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing a pair of shorts and </v>

506
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:05.050
<v Speaker 3>you're barely wearing a shirt because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out there in the field or you </v>

507
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:05.720
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting ready to go in the field.</v>

508
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:11.260
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great life and you're constantly </v>

509
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.971
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hanging out with a bunch of guys </v>

510
00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 3>that are pretty much have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude as you for the most part.</v>

511
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.040
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple guys that don't cut it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some guys that are super </v>

512
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 3>studs and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing your best to emulate them,</v>

513
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 3>but you're hanging out with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>great guys.</v>

514
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a young seal,</v>

515
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.760
<v Speaker 3>well we'd get to Friday and we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 3>go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a beer,</v>

517
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 3>we'd get done Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd still go to work Sunday,</v>

518
00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 3>we'd still go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go work out,</v>

519
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:34.850
<v Speaker 3>we'd hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd work on our gear,</v>

520
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:36.860
<v Speaker 3>we'd get ready and there was even not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even a war going on.</v>

521
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 3>We were just into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:26:38.331 --> 00:26:42.260
<v Speaker 3>we were just fired up for the seal teams</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was so it's,</v>

523
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>it's a great life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once the war</v>

524
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 2>started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity definitely picked up </v>

525
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.160
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew that we were going into </v>

526
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 2>combat and everyone pushed that much </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder.</v>

527
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the nineties,</v>

528
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:03.290
<v Speaker 2>we used to train really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard because it was an unknown </v>

529
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:03.290
<v Speaker 2>element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.620
<v Speaker 2>there was an unknown element where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what was really going to.</v>

531
00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:07.350
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know what combat was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

532
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 2>So you trained as hard as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

533
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:15.141
<v Speaker 2>Figure out how to train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We trained and then once combat started </v>

534
00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:15.141
<v Speaker 2>and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

535
00:27:15.141 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 2>well we kind of know what we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with now.</v>

536
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.990
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a fight or go into a camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>if he's never fought in the UFC before,</v>

537
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 2>he's going to train super hard to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>his debut.</v>

538
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe after he wins really easily as </v>

539
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.951
<v Speaker 2>first couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he backs off on that train and </v>

540
00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:27.951
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>

541
00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Not that we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely mentally was there,</v>

542
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

543
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.350
<v Speaker 2>to push hard even before combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just essentially saying that even</v>

544
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.950
<v Speaker 2>before you were going to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were gonna be ready.</v>

545
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:38.870
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

546
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 2>you were going to make sure that you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your boxes checked,</v>

547
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 2>you get all your ducks in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

548
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.370
<v Speaker 2>How much physical training is there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you're actually deployed it,</v>

549
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 2>it depends on where you are and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>

550
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what type of missions </v>

551
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.480
<v Speaker 2>you're going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

552
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 2>being in the seal teams is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical job and again,</v>

553
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:58.950
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a baseline.</v>

554
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Everyone expects it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna be able to put on your </v>

555
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>rucksack and your gear and go out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>move and shoot and communicate.</v>

556
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's expected to do it and </v>

557
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:09.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever you have to do to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen is,</v>

558
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 2>is kind of on you.</v>

559
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Although we do do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know team,</v>

560
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 2>what we call pt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical training,</v>

561
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:20.781
<v Speaker 2>but we do team pet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it is on you as an </v>

562
00:28:20.781 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 2>individual or your smaller element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

563
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:23.850
<v Speaker 2>group of guys and that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to,</v>

564
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you got to stay in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not want to be the guy that can't</v>

565
00:28:27.001 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 2>carry as can't carry his weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

566
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get,</v>

567
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 2>you'll get kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

568
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's not structured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not organized like say if you're </v>

569
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 2>deployed in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was getting at was I always </v>

570
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.901
<v Speaker 2>wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would imagine that the type of </v>

571
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:41.901
<v Speaker 2>workouts that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're exhausting,</v>

572
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:42.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

573
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.030
<v Speaker 2>you're dead lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing cleans and presses and all </v>

574
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.220
<v Speaker 2>this crazy shit and chin ups and running</v>
<v Speaker 2>up hills.</v>

575
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.880
<v Speaker 2>If you had to go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right after a hard workout like that,</v>

576
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take something out of you.</v>

577
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've gotta use you gotta use common </v>

578
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.350
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

579
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know like when to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or what to do?</v>

580
00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

581
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do like a massive </v>

582
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 2>squat workout while you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployment.</v>

583
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 2>That's going to put you in there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four days.</v>

584
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:09.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

585
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a pavel,</v>

586
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.180
<v Speaker 2>you know the pavel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

587
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

588
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:20.181
<v Speaker 2>he kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that from him years and years </v>

589
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:20.181
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:23.900
<v Speaker 2>because he was trained in some swat guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in La and I talked to some of those </v>

591
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:23.900
<v Speaker 2>guys and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

593
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to go to exhaustion to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get stronger.</v>

594
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay cool.</v>

595
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

596
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be ready to operate,</v>

597
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:36.051
<v Speaker 2>that's your primary mission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be ready to go out on the </v>

598
00:29:36.051 --> 00:29:36.480
<v Speaker 2>battlefield and get after it so you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to crush yourself so hard that</v>

599
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.610
<v Speaker 2>you're incapacitated.</v>

600
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a guy that believes in to </v>

601
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.000
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

602
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 2>He's got some interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't ideas and I'm not like some,</v>

603
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:50.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some follower from just one of those </v>

604
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:50.371
<v Speaker 2>things I heard along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

605
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

606
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different philosophies </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to training.</v>

607
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

608
00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:00.020
<v Speaker 2>so when you're deployed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially all entirely on you </v>

609
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 2>other than the group organized pt </v>
<v Speaker 2>trainings just about.</v>

610
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just about.</v>

611
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 2>So do you guys get together and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

612
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go running or we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live today,</v>

613
00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 2>or we're gonna go do some pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about martial arts training?</v>

614
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 2>How much martial arts training is </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved?</v>

615
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.560
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that depends on what the situation is </v>

616
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:19.560
<v Speaker 2>and who you're working with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

617
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.611
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were a junior officer that was </v>

618
00:30:23.611 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 2>working for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are going to be trained Jujitsu</v>

619
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:25.210
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

620
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.540
<v Speaker 2>If they're working for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on who they're working </v>

621
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:30.540
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

623
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.020
<v Speaker 2>I needed training partners and so I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

624
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:38.190
<v Speaker 2>So when you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you take guys and teach them some </v>

625
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 2>basic stuff and then just choked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit out of him?</v>

626
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Is that the move?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>

627
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you talk them through it while you're</v>

628
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 2>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like defend,</v>

629
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 2>get your arm here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

630
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

631
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I would actually improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.810
<v Speaker 2>I'd go on deployment and come back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

633
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.940
<v Speaker 2>some guy that maybe I was having good </v>
<v Speaker 2>battles with before I left to come back </v>

634
00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.331
<v Speaker 2>and be better because all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go and work on really good offense </v>

635
00:31:00.331 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 2>against a bunch of strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

636
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 2>psycho seals that don't want to tap and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make it work.</v>

637
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd come back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be better.</v>

639
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get worse on deployment.</v>

640
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that Sadie Bravo's theory?</v>

641
00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:16.561
<v Speaker 2>He believed that the real way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better is not to train with people </v>

642
00:31:16.561 --> 00:31:20.521
<v Speaker 2>better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to train with people that aren't as </v>

643
00:31:20.521 --> 00:31:21.340
<v Speaker 2>good as you and just constantly drill </v>
<v Speaker 2>finishes over and over and over again,</v>

644
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:26.341
<v Speaker 2>sharpen them up like a Samurai sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when you do spar with people </v>

645
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:31.411
<v Speaker 2>that are your level or better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be much better just because </v>

646
00:31:31.411 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly used to finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

647
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>

648
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:39.181
<v Speaker 2>You've got to train with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than you and you got to train </v>

649
00:31:39.181 --> 00:31:39.181
<v Speaker 2>with people that are worse than you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

650
00:31:39.181 --> 00:31:42.900
<v Speaker 2>we do that in seal training to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the seal training that I ran </v>

651
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.681
<v Speaker 2>before I got out was not like the seal </v>
<v Speaker 2>training where you see with the guys </v>

652
00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 2>with the the logs carrying those around </v>
<v Speaker 2>or boats on the head that like I said,</v>

653
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the basic training in and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>really cares too much about that.</v>

654
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Once you get in the seal teams because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just over,</v>

655
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 2>it's just a smash you in the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>smash.</v>

656
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 2>You make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

657
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.580
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not opposed to exactly have the </v>

658
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 2>intestinal fortitude to bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you get in the seal teams,</v>

659
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:09.150
<v Speaker 2>then you go through something called a </v>
<v Speaker 2>workup and that's when you've got seal </v>

660
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.901
<v Speaker 2>platoons that are trying to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and we do crazy simulated </v>

661
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 2>combat on these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is awesome.</v>

662
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

663
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have a paint ball.</v>

664
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like little kid stuff,</v>

665
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

666
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>you get awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paintball,</v>

667
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:24.730
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited paintball rounds.</v>

668
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 2>We had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

669
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:31.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the best laser tag system that </v>

670
00:32:31.231 --> 00:32:35.761
<v Speaker 2>anyone could ever imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This crazy expensive laser tag system </v>

671
00:32:35.761 --> 00:32:40.321
<v Speaker 2>where you could go out and fight each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other with laser tag and when you were </v>

672
00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:40.321
<v Speaker 2>getting at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the</v>

673
00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:41.780
<v Speaker 3>rounds weren't theoretically hitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

674
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:46.781
<v Speaker 3>then there was a little speaker on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder that would make noises as if </v>

675
00:32:46.781 --> 00:32:50.051
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going over your head so that you </v>

676
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.851
<v Speaker 3>would know to get down and there'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>explosions going off on these little </v>

677
00:32:51.851 --> 00:32:55.061
<v Speaker 3>speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you get back from these </v>

678
00:32:55.061 --> 00:32:55.061
<v Speaker 3>training operations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

679
00:32:55.061 --> 00:32:57.800
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have little embedded gpss in them.</v>

680
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:02.890
<v Speaker 3>So you'd put it out on Google earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could watch the whole battle unfold </v>

681
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 3>and watch what people did right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

682
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 3>And my point in this is that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>many times,</v>

683
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:13.151
<v Speaker 3>especially in the beginning when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>seals weren't quite up to speed yet and </v>

684
00:33:13.151 --> 00:33:13.280
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know how to work together </v>
<v Speaker 3>that well,</v>

685
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.540
<v Speaker 3>three or four or five opposing for seal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these are guys that are pretending to</v>

686
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 3>be bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would kill them all.</v>

687
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 3>They would just go out there and murder </v>
<v Speaker 3>them all.</v>

688
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.680
<v Speaker 3>And as these guys got better and started</v>
<v Speaker 3>to work together and the leadership </v>

689
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.020
<v Speaker 3>started to step up and take command and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do a better job of leading,</v>

690
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seals would start to beat the </v>

691
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.811
<v Speaker 3>opposing force and annihilate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What an incredible tool to learn how to </v>

692
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:41.621
<v Speaker 3>organize and to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay together and work together as a </v>

693
00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they used to do in the past?</v>

694
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very interesting topic because </v>

695
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.700
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.630
<v Speaker 3>what the UFC did to martial arts because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

697
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1991,</v>

698
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I could sit here and talk it,</v>

699
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you could be a Kung Fu guy and I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be an Aikido guy and we could be like,</v>

700
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:03.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my martial arts better and you can be </v>

701
00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:04.991
<v Speaker 3>saying the same thing and we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretically debated all day long but </v>

702
00:34:04.991 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 3>we'd never actually do it.</v>

703
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.300
<v Speaker 3>And it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in combat,</v>

704
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 3>obviously you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

705
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 3>we can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

706
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:11.990
<v Speaker 3>let's find out which one's better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on the same team,</v>

707
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to kill each other to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out you can't do that.</v>

708
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing that happened was </v>
<v Speaker 3>simunition and that's,</v>

709
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:22.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically started paintball but </v>

710
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.680
<v Speaker 3>it's high speed paintball that fits in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your real gun fits in a real,</v>

711
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 3>a real gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take your,</v>

712
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.700
<v Speaker 3>you put a new barrel on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your standard,</v>

713
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue weapon and now you're shooting </v>

714
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.100
<v Speaker 3>paint balls out of your real gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have 30 rounds.</v>

715
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 3>He changed magazines like very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar to real combat and all of a</v>

716
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:40.190
<v Speaker 3>sudden just like a punching bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

717
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 3>when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

718
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:42.220
<v Speaker 3>the punching bag doesn't punch back </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

719
00:34:42.221 --> 00:34:47.221
<v Speaker 3>When you go into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a house and you shoot a bunch of </v>

720
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:47.221
<v Speaker 3>paper targets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't move,</v>

721
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:47.221
<v Speaker 3>they don't shoot back.</v>

722
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:47.221
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

723
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:52.330
<v Speaker 3>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you win every single time and you can </v>

724
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 3>get pretty confident with your tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your tactics aren't getting tested.</v>

725
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.480
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when these great technologies come came </v>

726
00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:58.480
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ammunition,</v>

727
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.720
<v Speaker 3>paint ball and these laser type systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

728
00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 3>it was a complete change and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely changed our tactics.</v>

729
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:08.411
<v Speaker 3>Our tactics evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like fight tactics evolved with </v>

730
00:35:08.411 --> 00:35:08.411
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the advent of the UFC.</v>

731
00:35:08.411 --> 00:35:08.411
<v Speaker 3>And people said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

732
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't work the way we thought it </v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

733
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of,</v>

734
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:17.291
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to go running into a </v>

735
00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:17.291
<v Speaker 3>room and no one's going to stop no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what.</v>

736
00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:20.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually if there's a machine gun just </v>

737
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.780
<v Speaker 3>lay in paint into you as you go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're stupid if you go running into </v>

738
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.751
<v Speaker 3>that room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we made these simple adjustments but </v>

739
00:35:25.751 --> 00:35:28.540
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting progression and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely imprinted the fact that you </v>

740
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 3>have to make your training as realistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>as possible.</v>

741
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.230
<v Speaker 3>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also shows you how people,</v>

742
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.620
<v Speaker 3>humans have a tendency to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing just because it's </v>

743
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 3>kind of what they believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

744
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think those,</v>

745
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 3>those traditional martial arts that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>so popular back in the day,</v>

746
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 3>people truly believed that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

747
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I will actually stop you with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

748
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 3>with my ci,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Ci will stop you.</v>

749
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really thought that I had one of my</v>

750
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu buddies was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

751
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.920
<v Speaker 3>had some ci guy in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

752
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you cannot take me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

753
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

754
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

755
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I settle my ci,</v>

756
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 3>you cannot take me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

757
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

758
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.970
<v Speaker 3>settle your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to try it?</v>

759
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

760
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 3>you can try all you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the guy you know,</v>

761
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 3>stands there and settles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is she out?</v>

762
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 3>And my buddy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you ready?</v>

763
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

764
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.760
<v Speaker 3>And he just like double legs and slammed</v>
<v Speaker 3>him on the ground,</v>

765
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 3>but the guy believed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy.</v>

766
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:26.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what people get get lured into,</v>

767
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:26.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

768
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 3>our egos listen into a lot of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to watch out for.</v>

769
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

770
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the belief is based on being taught by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who also believe it too.</v>

771
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And it's so confusing because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced it in,</v>

772
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.540
<v Speaker 1>in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was why the initial question was </v>

773
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.450
<v Speaker 1>when they used to prepare like back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam or you know,</v>

774
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.670
<v Speaker 1>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

775
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

776
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 1>when was this stuff invented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we did,</v>

777
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 1>they had it during the first Gulf War.</v>

778
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Barely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely.</v>

779
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Very small groups had it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

780
00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:03.490
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as many as should they have the </v>

781
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:03.490
<v Speaker 3>laser setup and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

782
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:03.490
<v Speaker 3>we didn't get the good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

783
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.190
<v Speaker 3>they had that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a worse laser system.</v>

784
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been trying to do it for years,</v>

785
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 3>but what did they used to do like during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnam era,</v>

786
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.980
<v Speaker 3>go off of the experience of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been in world war two and Korea to </v>

787
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.580
<v Speaker 3>try and pass that on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily,</v>

788
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.720
<v Speaker 3>and honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:25.060
<v Speaker 3>being in combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basic principles of combat are not </v>

790
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.750
<v Speaker 3>the super crazy complex things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

791
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 3>the most basic principle that we talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about is cover and move,</v>

792
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 3>which is if you and I are going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>assault a building over there,</v>

793
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take cover.</v>

794
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to engage that building so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the enemy can't put their heads up </v>

795
00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 3>and while I'm shooting at the building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting where we think the enemy are,</v>

796
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.360
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get up and maneuver into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better position.</v>

797
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Once you get into a better position and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get some cover,</v>

798
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:53.930
<v Speaker 3>you're going to start shooting at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy and that's going to allow me to </v>

799
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I get to a better position,</v>

800
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I'll start shooting again and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to do that.</v>

801
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Supporting each other as we move to </v>
<v Speaker 3>retarget.</v>

802
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.030
<v Speaker 3>And then once we get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll kill the bad guys and there'll be,</v>

803
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.190
<v Speaker 3>it'll be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most basic principle.</v>

804
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 3>But there's times where before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

805
00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.460
<v Speaker 3>in between Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is where we had major combat and </v>

806
00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.581
<v Speaker 3>people learned that cover moving guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were in Vietnam were the people </v>

807
00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:16.341
<v Speaker 3>that taught me covering move in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>that time and the time when we started </v>

808
00:38:16.341 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 3>using this ammunition and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lasers,</v>

809
00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:22.941
<v Speaker 3>the better products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually forgot some of those </v>

810
00:38:22.941 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 3>lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As crazy as that might seem.</v>

811
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 3>We actually forgot some of these very </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple basic lessons of,</v>

812
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.540
<v Speaker 3>of gun fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was great to have it back and </v>

813
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 3>it was when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we went to combat finally,</v>

814
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 3>we were more prepared for</v>

815
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

816
00:38:36.671 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that kind of simulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

817
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you're calling it simunition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

818
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:44.740
<v Speaker 1>that's an actual name brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a name brand it,</v>

819
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the paint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

820
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 1>So send me an issue is the paint and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laser.</v>

821
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.900
<v Speaker 1>What is the name brand of that stuff?</v>

822
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 3>One that we used was called debts and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was made by sob and I don't know,</v>

823
00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if they still make it </v>

824
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>or if that contracts don't go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was awesome.</v>

825
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like your analogy to martial arts,</v>

826
00:39:02.701 --> 00:39:04.170
<v Speaker 1>like testing it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

827
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:09.180
<v Speaker 1>in the actual competition because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would seem that that would be the only </v>

828
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.941
<v Speaker 1>way that anybody would ever actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn what mistakes not to make and how </v>

829
00:39:13.941 --> 00:39:17.961
<v Speaker 1>they could easily be replicated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat and then the repeated actions of </v>

830
00:39:18.601 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 1>doing those over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingraining them in your mind is probably</v>

831
00:39:22.291 --> 00:39:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that could really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could draw upon when you're in those</v>

832
00:39:27.271 --> 00:39:29.430
<v Speaker 1>intense situations of an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>firefighter.</v>

833
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's another good comparison.</v>

834
00:39:31.621 --> 00:39:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody say this,</v>

835
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:36.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say like,</v>

836
00:39:36.391 --> 00:39:41.391
<v Speaker 3>let's say I train some Kung Fu stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm and I attacker and I rip your </v>

837
00:39:41.391 --> 00:39:43.110
<v Speaker 3>throat out and all that stuff and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>train,</v>

838
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

839
00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Muay Thai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling and boxing.</v>

840
00:39:45.391 --> 00:39:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people will say that you're not ready</v>

841
00:39:49.141 --> 00:39:54.141
<v Speaker 3>for the fact that I'm going to poke your</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes out or you're not ready for the </v>

842
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:56.811
<v Speaker 3>fact that I'm going to try and grab your</v>
<v Speaker 3>throat or whatever and therefore I have </v>

843
00:39:56.811 --> 00:40:00.111
<v Speaker 3>an advantage and a and that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a training scar because you</v>

844
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.020
<v Speaker 3>aren't used to doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>

845
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:09.230
<v Speaker 3>So if like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if all I do is train to grab your eyes </v>

846
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.630
<v Speaker 3>and poke your throat or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure point type attack,</v>

847
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.040
<v Speaker 3>then that means that I'm better prepared</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a street conflict.</v>

848
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.060
<v Speaker 3>And as you and I both know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy that does that versus a guy </v>

849
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that trains in mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing,</v>

850
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 3>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moitai,</v>

851
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:32.150
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's going to destroy this other </v>

852
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.091
<v Speaker 3>person in the street fight and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>will grab for Xyz and then he's gonna </v>

853
00:40:35.091 --> 00:40:35.370
<v Speaker 3>get his arm broken off and is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get punched in at 47 times.</v>

854
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 3>But my point in telling them that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that this.</v>

855
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.490
<v Speaker 3>We had the same type of people in inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seal teams that said,</v>

856
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get used to training with paint </v>

857
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.831
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to develop training </v>

858
00:40:51.831 --> 00:40:54.720
<v Speaker 3>scars from it so you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to your regular weapon.</v>

859
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.580
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be used to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>recoil of a real gun and you're going to</v>

860
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.720
<v Speaker 3>have more courage because it's only </v>
<v Speaker 3>going against paint and wall.</v>

861
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:08.280
<v Speaker 3>That while there's some small piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth to that,</v>

862
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.850
<v Speaker 3>just like there's some small piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth to the fact that if,</v>

863
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.990
<v Speaker 3>if you never think about what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be punched while you're doing </v>

864
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:19.041
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then it's going to be a surprise </v>

865
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:19.041
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

866
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:19.041
<v Speaker 3>The first time you you are in guard with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and they crack you in the face.</v>

867
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.880
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some small truth who,</v>

868
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a reason to throw out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

869
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.410
<v Speaker 3>that type of training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't make sense.</v>

870
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.940
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that's good about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

871
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu and boxing and wrestling,</v>

872
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 3>you're going live against another human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being that's a maneuvering on you and </v>

873
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>trying to defeat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have paint ball or laser,</v>

874
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.990
<v Speaker 3>you're going against another human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's trying to maneuver on you and </v>

875
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.721
<v Speaker 3>defeat you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So therefore it's very effective in </v>

876
00:41:43.721 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 3>teaching and what real combat is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like.</v>

877
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 3>What was it like the first time you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>deployed and when was that?</v>

878
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 3>The first time I was deployed in 2003 </v>
<v Speaker 3>and deployed to Baghdad,</v>

879
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was great.</v>

880
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 3>That's not what most people would think </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

881
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't never think of that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very it.</v>

882
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.930
<v Speaker 3>What was interesting about my first </v>
<v Speaker 3>deployment to Iraq was that again,</v>

883
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:13.931
<v Speaker 3>I was so happy to be in a position where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a platoon commander and we were </v>

884
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 3>doing real missions and I was excited </v>
<v Speaker 3>and happy about that.</v>

885
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean I was running around </v>

886
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.840
<v Speaker 3>smile on my face and we had a legit job </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had to get it done.</v>

887
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.770
<v Speaker 3>It was also a time where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the insurgents,</v>

888
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't an insurgency yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hadn't even really heard that word in</v>

889
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:38.771
<v Speaker 3>2003.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the operations that we did were </v>

890
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.960
<v Speaker 3>relatively simple and our tactical </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage over the enemy was good enough</v>

891
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 3>that we just annihilated them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

892
00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:53.930
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like an unfair fight,</v>

893
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.010
<v Speaker 3>which is how you want it to be.</v>

894
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.510
<v Speaker 3>You want to have an unfair fight in </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat.</v>

895
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.370
<v Speaker 3>And so we would go in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

896
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 3>2:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning,</v>

897
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:02.950
<v Speaker 3>we'd find out what a bad guy was in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>house or some officer,</v>

898
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 3>some building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'd load up our vehicles and go in </v>

899
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blast their door open with big explosive</v>

900
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 3>breaching charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear their house in about 30 seconds,</v>

901
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 3>grab them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab their buddies,</v>

902
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 3>bring them all back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interrogate them,</v>

903
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 3>find out where their friends are and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and do it again.</v>

904
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 3>And it was awesome and it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a rockstar deployment.</v>

905
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:27.401
<v Speaker 3>We'd come home at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and be done and debrief </v>

906
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 3>the operation and get ready to do it the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next day.</v>

907
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 3>We probably were in four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>firefights during that whole deployment.</v>

908
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Couple ambushes and I had one guy get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get wounded,</v>

909
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 3>not very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

910
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.800
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny,</v>

911
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>it was good and we were ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

912
00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 3>and the contrast comes when you go to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>next deployment,</v>

913
00:43:55.010 --> 00:44:00.010
<v Speaker 3>the next deployment to Ramadi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was completely different.</v>

914
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 3>So and on that deployment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything bad that can happen too.</v>

915
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 3>A guy in a leadership position or an </v>
<v Speaker 3>element happened to us,</v>

916
00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.390
<v Speaker 3>everything bad that could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

917
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was radically different than my first</v>

918
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:31.471
<v Speaker 3>deployment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your first deployment was a in a </v>

919
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>sense a like what people</v>

920
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
<v Speaker 1>expected the war to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after we had experienced Desert </v>

921
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desert Storm,</v>

922
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:42.921
<v Speaker 1>which was just an overwhelming success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the only casualties were when that </v>

923
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:48.741
<v Speaker 1>one Scud missile had hid a barracks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>

924
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 1>that was what America thought war was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

925
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:53.550
<v Speaker 1>well this is how good we are at it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

926
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 1>We just go over there and we kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody and we lose a couple people.</v>

927
00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And real sad about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

928
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 3>we wrapped it up tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your second deployment,</v>

929
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.070
<v Speaker 1>what was that like and how did it begin?</v>

930
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:15.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it began with our deployment orders </v>

931
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.581
<v Speaker 3>changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were literally two weeks from </v>

932
00:45:19.581 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 3>going on deployment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now my first deployment to Iraq,</v>

933
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:24.891
<v Speaker 3>I was what's called a platoon commander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had 15 or 20 guys underneath me </v>

934
00:45:24.891 --> 00:45:27.870
<v Speaker 3>depending on what time during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deployment it was.</v>

935
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.810
<v Speaker 3>And we were an assault force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

936
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 3>we jokingly called ourselves Baghdad </v>
<v Speaker 3>Swat because that's what we did.</v>

937
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Speaker 3>I just kind of describe what those </v>
<v Speaker 3>missions were like.</v>

938
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.080
<v Speaker 3>My second deployment now I was what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>called a task unit commander and I had </v>

939
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.550
<v Speaker 3>two of those seal platoons with 15 to 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that were underneath me and then we</v>

940
00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:54.651
<v Speaker 3>had another 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 or 70 support personnel.</v>

941
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 3>So these are people that do Intel </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

942
00:45:57.031 --> 00:46:02.031
<v Speaker 3>that man the radios,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that clean and repair our weapons</v>

943
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.320
<v Speaker 3>and people that keep the camera running </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>

944
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

945
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 3>it's about 100 guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's only 35 or 40 seals.</v>

946
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 3>And we found out about two weeks before </v>
<v Speaker 3>we went on deployment,</v>

947
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 3>our deployment changed instead of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Baghdad.</v>

948
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 3>And really doing more bag that swat </v>
<v Speaker 3>operations we went,</v>

949
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.880
<v Speaker 3>we were told we were going to Ramadi and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was again,</v>

950
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.380
<v Speaker 3>and people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

951
00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:32.381
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you fought that and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't believe how twisted you are and </v>

952
00:46:32.381 --> 00:46:35.651
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe what a sick individual </v>

953
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:35.651
<v Speaker 3>you are and et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

954
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:35.651
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>

955
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:38.990
<v Speaker 3>I was extremely happy and motivated that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to Ramadi because it was the</v>

956
00:46:38.991 --> 00:46:42.020
<v Speaker 3>worst place in Iraq and that is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I wanted to be my whole life.</v>

957
00:46:42.021 --> 00:46:43.370
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fired up to go there.</v>

958
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Just so</v>

959
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.700
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

960
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.570
<v Speaker 1>it's so counterintuitive to the way most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think.</v>

961
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hung around with a bunch of guys </v>

962
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.570
<v Speaker 3>that thought the same damn thing is me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go get these guys.</v>

963
00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's get after it.</v>

964
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you are who you are.</v>

965
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

966
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.220
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's important to have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you in the world like this.</v>

967
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a spectrum of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a spectrum of human being and </v>

968
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.201
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the extreme edge of exactly </v>

969
00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:16.710
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have an army,</v>

970
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Speaker 1>have you put together a military force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a guy like you that has that </v>

971
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:26.391
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a guy who's going to the </v>

972
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:26.391
<v Speaker 1>worst place in the world saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

973
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 1>why me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

974
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't I become a Baker like</v>

975
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 2>my dad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be making cupcakes right now.</v>

976
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Instead I'm shooting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

977
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

978
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

979
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

980
00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.280
<v Speaker 2>and the seal teams and the Rangers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the special forces does a very good job </v>

981
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.360
<v Speaker 2>of attracting the type of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>

982
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the type of people that are fired up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that job and not encouraging it and </v>

983
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.280
<v Speaker 2>growing it like you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the amount of camaraderie </v>

984
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and the intensity of the friendships and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bond,</v>

985
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 2>that brotherhood that you developed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people just intensifies it all.</v>

986
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big gang.</v>

987
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:11.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big awesome gang that you're a </v>

988
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.821
<v Speaker 2>part of that's bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're part of this fraternity is </v>

989
00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 2>brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

990
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 2>they definitely fuel the fire and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I should say,</v>

991
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:23.440
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say they fuel the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fueled the fire.</v>

992
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are the fire,</v>

993
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys that are there,</v>

994
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.530
<v Speaker 2>the guys that I worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fired up guys that are </v>

995
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.220
<v Speaker 2>completely ready to do this job.</v>

996
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 2>So you get over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in Ramadi,</v>

997
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:40.890
<v Speaker 2>totally different situation than banked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at totally different situation in </v>

998
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he immediately realizes immediately,</v>

999
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:49.060
<v Speaker 2>immediately we were going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think,</v>

1000
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I think we went to the first memorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>service for an American within,</v>

1001
00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 hours of being on the ground there.</v>

1002
00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.730
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

1003
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my camp got attacked the,</v>

1004
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the third or fourth night that we </v>

1005
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.701
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every guy was on the roof of our </v>

1006
00:49:08.701 --> 00:49:10.861
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting back at bad guys that were </v>

1007
00:49:10.861 --> 00:49:11.200
<v Speaker 2>shooting at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1008
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.320
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we started conducting </v>

1009
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.701
<v Speaker 2>operations almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the operations were just,</v>

1010
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:22.890
<v Speaker 2>just radically different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the enemy owned the downtown area</v>

1011
00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:23.930
<v Speaker 2>from Audi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1012
00:49:23.931 --> 00:49:28.931
<v Speaker 2>they were the dominant force down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whereas before you'd be going through</v>

1013
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:31.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of semi permissive environment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baghdad,</v>

1014
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 2>meaning that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of civilians and they just </v>

1016
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:39.360
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get out of your way and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go and find this bad guy,</v>

1017
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 2>well in Ramadi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guys,</v>

1018
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:46.531
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was different and they were </v>

1019
00:49:46.531 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were who had trained them.</v>

1020
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were former regime </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements,</v>

1021
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.370
<v Speaker 2>so some of them were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ramadi was a,</v>

1022
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 2>was an Iraqi military city as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some of them leftover,</v>

1023
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 2>actually a bunch of them leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you had Syrians coming in,</v>

1024
00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:04.020
<v Speaker 2>foreign fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1025
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.460
<v Speaker 2>people coming in from all over Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia,</v>

1026
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1027
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.240
<v Speaker 2>they'd come in from all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come and engage and get their Jihad </v>

1028
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.210
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with a motivated because America was</v>

1029
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:15.690
<v Speaker 2>now occupying Iraq because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

1030
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.440
<v Speaker 2>was driving them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more than the fact that that </v>

1031
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.440
<v Speaker 2>America was occupying Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they wanted to take that land.</v>

1032
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America was no longer occupying Iraq </v>

1033
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.470
<v Speaker 2>when they went in and took Ramadi this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1034
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 2>We were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd been gone for four years,</v>

1035
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 2>so the occupation of Iraq was not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving force behind this.</v>

1036
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you realize right away,</v>

1037
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 2>it's different.</v>

1038
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.440
<v Speaker 2>You're experiencing casualties at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>level that was unheard of in Baghdad and</v>

1039
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 2>you are engaging with an enemy that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very prepared and overwhelming.</v>

1040
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>

1041
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:57.610
<v Speaker 2>They were similar to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning they did like a first world </v>

1042
00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 2>country type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had met a medical evacuation.</v>

1043
00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Plans are one of their guys would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>wounded.</v>

1044
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 2>You'd see them get evacuated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you could watch on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the screens,</v>

1046
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:11.351
<v Speaker 2>you could watch what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A vehicle would come in and gathered </v>

1047
00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 2>them up and take one of the guys away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd bring in reinforcements.</v>

1048
00:51:12.231 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 2>They had communications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did fire maneuver.</v>

1049
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.650
<v Speaker 2>They did the same basic tactics that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about.</v>

1050
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.680
<v Speaker 2>They did those tactics as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a real well trained and </v>

1051
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:27.950
<v Speaker 2>well coordinated and determined enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this expected?</v>

1052
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew what Ramadi was like.</v>

1053
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say it was expected,</v>

1054
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to mentally picture what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be like when you,</v>

1055
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 2>when you're going to go up against guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are that prepared.</v>

1056
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:51.100
<v Speaker 2>So this was tactically and as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the strategy that was involved to </v>

1057
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:59.171
<v Speaker 2>try to take a city like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a fairly new experience for the</v>

1058
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 2>United States military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1059
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:05.711
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd never had what other being other </v>

1060
00:52:05.711 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 2>what Somalia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what other urban war had a,</v>

1061
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 2>the United States engaged in like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're in a city.</v>

1062
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously World War Two had all </v>

1063
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.040
<v Speaker 2>kinds of conflict and in Vietnam there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was portions,</v>

1064
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle of waste,</v>

1065
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:22.050
<v Speaker 2>waste city was a huge urban conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somalia was definitely urban combat,</v>

1066
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 2>but you're right in the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't going in there to try and stay.</v>

1067
00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:32.110
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences or changes in strategies </v>

1068
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 2>that the US military had that turned the</v>
<v Speaker 2>war around.</v>

1069
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And that was as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the insurgence grew and it's 2004,</v>

1070
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:46.870
<v Speaker 2>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insurgency started getting more and </v>

1071
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:49.481
<v Speaker 2>more unified and better and more well </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained and more organized and America.</v>

1072
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:57.820
<v Speaker 2>What we did was kind of go back to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong basis.</v>

1073
00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:01.100
<v Speaker 2>So there's basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand this in Iraq,</v>

1074
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.930
<v Speaker 2>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2006,</v>

1075
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>if you went to a base in let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>Baghdad International Airport,</v>

1076
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:10.830
<v Speaker 2>there was a huge US military base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a subway,</v>

1077
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 2>the sandwich shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subway,</v>

1078
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:18.670
<v Speaker 2>starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These places have become little little </v>

1079
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:21.970
<v Speaker 2>outcroppings of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we did when the insurgency </v>

1080
00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:25.481
<v Speaker 2>got worse and worse and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the public opinion of the war </v>

1081
00:53:25.481 --> 00:53:28.721
<v Speaker 2>went down and down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden we're sitting here </v>

1082
00:53:28.721 --> 00:53:28.721
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

1083
00:53:28.721 --> 00:53:31.030
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to want to minimize </v>

1084
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.030
<v Speaker 3>casualties as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>

1085
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 3>You do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go back to your base.</v>

1086
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did that as a country.</v>

1087
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 3>We kind of said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1088
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to take huge risks </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1089
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:42.171
<v Speaker 3>We're going to pull back to our basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try and support the </v>

1090
00:53:42.171 --> 00:53:44.241
<v Speaker 3>Iraqis as much as we can and let them go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and try and accomplish missions and </v>

1091
00:53:44.241 --> 00:53:48.801
<v Speaker 3>we still did do missions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we definitely had strong and move </v>

1092
00:53:50.751 --> 00:53:52.020
<v Speaker 3>back to these big basis.</v>

1093
00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy a there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were several people and one of </v>

1094
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 3>them was general Patraeus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote this,</v>

1095
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.430
<v Speaker 3>you know the counterinsurgency manual </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1096
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what you had was you went from this </v>

1097
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 3>idea of we're fighting kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists and all of a sudden you're </v>

1098
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:09.760
<v Speaker 3>fighting an organized insurgency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a huge strategy,</v>

1099
00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 3>strategic shift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so now instead of going out and </v>

1100
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:15.880
<v Speaker 3>grabbing a bad guy and then coming back </v>
<v Speaker 3>the the,</v>

1101
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 3>the new strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was implemented in Ramadi by a </v>

1102
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:25.420
<v Speaker 3>guy named Colonel Sean Mcfarland was c's</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear hold and build,</v>

1103
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.760
<v Speaker 3>which means you're going to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>these enemy controlled neighborhoods.</v>

1104
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You're going to take buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hold those buildings.</v>

1105
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.540
<v Speaker 3>You're going to build them into your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>fortes and you're going to have American</v>

1106
00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:39.541
<v Speaker 3>and Iraqi soldiers live in those enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled territory's until the enemy </v>

1107
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:39.541
<v Speaker 3>was gone.</v>

1108
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Had that ever been implemented before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had been implemented in [inaudible] </v>

1109
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 3>in northern Iraq by a guy named h Dot h </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dot r dot mcmaster was another kind of </v>

1110
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.590
<v Speaker 3>legendary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a military army colonel at the time.</v>

1111
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.320
<v Speaker 3>All these guys are generals now because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're awesome guys.</v>

1112
00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.590
<v Speaker 3>He'd implemented up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually turned that plan over.</v>

1113
00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Two Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Farlane and gentlemen.</v>

1114
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Foreman came down to Ramadi and </v>
<v Speaker 3>implemented the plan there,</v>

1115
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 3>but what was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was hard to understand is no one </v>

1116
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.180
<v Speaker 3>really knew about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one understood it all.</v>

1117
00:55:13.181 --> 00:55:14.980
<v Speaker 3>They all they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1118
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying we're going to go into </v>

1119
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:21.871
<v Speaker 3>these enemy controlled neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 3>where were there haven't been American </v>

1120
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:22.540
<v Speaker 3>or coalition forces for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>year and a half,</v>

1121
00:55:22.541 --> 00:55:27.541
<v Speaker 3>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying we're going to go in </v>

1122
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:27.541
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right before we arrived in Ramadi,</v>

1123
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:29.620
<v Speaker 3>there was a road that the marine corps </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to penetrate down.</v>

1124
00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 3>They hit 13 ids and 500 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 1330 $500.</v>

1125
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.710
<v Speaker 3>So essentially what is 500 meters is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1126
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.770
<v Speaker 3>it's every 50 meters or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little less than 50 meters.</v>

1127
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.610
<v Speaker 3>What does that football fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much I foot five football fields.</v>

1128
00:55:45.611 --> 00:55:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's insane.</v>

1129
00:55:46.721 --> 00:55:48.130
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1130
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:53.820
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this new strategy to go in there and </v>

1131
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.151
<v Speaker 3>pushing there was considered to be by </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people was considered to be too </v>

1132
00:55:57.401 --> 00:56:00.310
<v Speaker 3>risky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too dangerous and,</v>

1133
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:04.600
<v Speaker 3>and really in some cases crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a crazy strategy.</v>

1134
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 3>We haven't been able to get down there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and now you're saying we're gonna go </v>

1135
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.080
<v Speaker 3>down there and live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a,</v>

1136
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.570
<v Speaker 3>it was a very dynamic change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a gigantic,</v>

1137
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.950
<v Speaker 3>gritty boots on the ground approach to </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking over a city,</v>

1138
00:56:17.951 --> 00:56:21.910
<v Speaker 3>like one step at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one building at a time.</v>

1139
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1140
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 2>That had to be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any documentary footage of </v>

1142
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.211
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were there any embedded journalists </v>

1143
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:36.211
<v Speaker 2>embedded journalists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1144
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 2>you can go on youtube and just Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ramadi,</v>

1145
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 2>2006 and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see some good stuff.</v>

1146
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>There is a documentary that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on the history channel.</v>

1147
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:47.590
<v Speaker 2>It's called a chance in hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle for Ramadi and that.</v>

1148
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 2>What's good about that one is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

1149
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys that we worked with while </v>
<v Speaker 2>we were there and what I was just trying</v>

1150
00:56:55.061 --> 00:57:00.061
<v Speaker 2>to convey to you about the fact that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people were saying this was a </v>

1151
00:57:00.061 --> 00:57:04.201
<v Speaker 2>suicidal operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hear these guys that were </v>

1152
00:57:04.201 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 2>officers in charge of battalions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

1153
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:10.140
<v Speaker 2>They're saying the same thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were getting told by their peers </v>

1154
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.691
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy idea and you guys are </v>

1155
00:57:12.691 --> 00:57:12.691
<v Speaker 2>all going to die if you go in there.</v>

1156
00:57:12.691 --> 00:57:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what is morale like when something </v>

1157
00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.461
<v Speaker 2>like that gets brought down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these are the orders and this is </v>

1158
00:57:20.461 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 2>what you have to do and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you it's a suicide mission.</v>

1159
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where leadership comes in because</v>

1160
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

1161
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:34.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the toughest things that I ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to convey to my guys was this fact </v>

1162
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.590
<v Speaker 2>that we were going to be working </v>
<v Speaker 2>alongside Iraqi soldiers,</v>

1163
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 2>conventional Iraqi soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you picture this.</v>

1164
00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 2>We have that first appointment I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1165
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.360
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were only working with seals,</v>

1166
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.710
<v Speaker 2>seals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy to your left was a sealed.</v>

1167
00:57:48.711 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 2>The guy to your right was the CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy behind you as a seal,</v>

1168
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.200
<v Speaker 2>the guy who you can trust and who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can trust them,</v>

1169
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you knew them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

1170
00:57:54.541 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 2>they were your brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we get to Ramadi,</v>

1171
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:03.180
<v Speaker 2>and the mission changed coming down from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the special operations forces that were </v>

1172
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 2>in charge of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all special operations in Iraq,</v>

1173
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new mission was to the new mission.</v>

1174
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of the exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1175
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:18.690
<v Speaker 2>was to train and fight company and </v>
<v Speaker 2>platoon sized elements of Iraqi </v>

1176
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:21.270
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Train and fight company,</v>

1177
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.350
<v Speaker 2>platoon size elements of Iraqi soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they say fight,</v>

1178
00:58:23.351 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 2>that means like that's a verb saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fight with them.</v>

1179
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 2>So all of a sudden I'm telling my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1180
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you know how you're used to working with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of seals.</v>

1181
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 2>You're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you go out,</v>

1182
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.320
<v Speaker 2>the majority of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be with our Iraqi </v>

1183
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.901
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the majority of guys now Iraqi </v>

1184
00:58:42.901 --> 00:58:44.410
<v Speaker 2>soldiers are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1185
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:44.970
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1186
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.730
<v Speaker 2>they're barely even military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people.</v>

1187
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 2>They're just unmotivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poorly trained.</v>

1188
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:58.110
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many cases their loyalty is </v>

1189
00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:58.110
<v Speaker 2>questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1190
00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:58.450
<v Speaker 2>these are guys that would shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans in the back.</v>

1191
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm telling my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1192
00:59:00.761 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there and do this.</v>

1193
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:07.470
<v Speaker 2>And obviously the first reaction I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

1194
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.670
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crap,</v>

1195
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>this garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we ever do that?</v>

1196
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst battlefield seals have</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought on since Vietnam.</v>

1197
00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And you want us to go out there with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of a bunch of Iraqi soldiers </v>

1198
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 2>watching our back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1199
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I heard it,</v>

1200
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.790
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was crazy too.</v>

1201
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.470
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what?</v>

1202
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to send your guys into</v>

1203
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:36.371
<v Speaker 2>harm's way in a much more vulnerable way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got to get them to do it.</v>

1204
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:43.010
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to understand what we're doing on,</v>

1205
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.320
<v Speaker 2>in my own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to understand why.</v>

1206
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would somebody be telling us to do </v>

1207
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems freaking crazy to me.</v>

1208
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.130
<v Speaker 2>So as I sat there and thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>

1209
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1210
00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:58.820
<v Speaker 2>why is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the president making us do this?</v>

1211
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Why is the general the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the Pentagon making us do this?</v>

1212
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Why are the generals and colonels on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield here in Iraq?</v>

1213
01:00:04.551 --> 01:00:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Why in God's name would they be making </v>
<v Speaker 2>us go out with Iraqi soldiers?</v>

1214
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I thought to myself,</v>

1215
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:10.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1216
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:11.810
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's answer that question.</v>

1217
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>news flash,</v>

1218
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.240
<v Speaker 2>if we don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't get the Iraqi soldiers </v>

1219
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.350
<v Speaker 2>trained up and ready to maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 2>security in their own country than who's</v>

1220
01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to do it?</v>

1221
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to train them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>

1222
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>who's gonna hold the security and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

1223
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was nobody in the answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>was us.</v>

1224
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:36.790
<v Speaker 2>The answer was we would be here forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these Iraqis need to be able to </v>

1225
01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:40.391
<v Speaker 2>get up and stand on their own two feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I explained that to my guys </v>

1226
01:00:40.391 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1227
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't want to work with Iraqi</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>

1228
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand there's more risk.</v>

1229
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Here's why we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it because if we don't do </v>

1230
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:49.550
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't get these guys up to speed,</v>

1231
01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.810
<v Speaker 2>if we don't teach them how to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and how to defeat this enemy,</v>

1232
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>they're never going to be able to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll be mired in this conflict </v>

1233
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

1234
01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:03.430
<v Speaker 2>And once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once they understood that strategic </v>

1235
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.621
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were able to get their head around </v>

1236
01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 2>it and then slowly accepted what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1237
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:12.370
<v Speaker 2>How common were there complications from</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the Iraqi soldiers and did </v>

1238
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:19.691
<v Speaker 2>you guys have to take steps in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch over them to make sure when </v>

1239
01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:24.681
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about guys shooting guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back shooting Americans in the </v>

1240
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.221
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have plans in place to make sure</v>

1241
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:29.270
<v Speaker 2>that someone was watching them at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>times?</v>

1242
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1243
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't treat them like,</v>

1244
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.800
<v Speaker 2>did some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they speak English?</v>

1245
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1246
01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>We had interpreters and oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nightmare.</v>

1247
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1248
01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:43.261
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we would have some of the Iraqi </v>

1249
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:43.261
<v Speaker 2>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

1250
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>some of the leadership of the Iraqi </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers would be very good.</v>

1251
01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Some of the grunts would be very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone will just disastrous.</v>

1252
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 2>And did we have to change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1253
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.460
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to change our tactics so that we </v>

1254
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.461
<v Speaker 2>didn't use the terms left and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't understand left and </v>

1255
01:01:57.461 --> 01:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>right or no numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them couldn't count.</v>

1256
01:01:59.121 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1257
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.770
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1258
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're totally on educated,</v>

1259
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.940
<v Speaker 2>totally uneducated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1260
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Can't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1261
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Go four doors down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1262
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.250
<v Speaker 2>something you can tell a five year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1263
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1264
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was,</v>

1265
01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:22.551
<v Speaker 2>that was definitely challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think allowed to call them savages </v>

1266
01:02:22.551 --> 01:02:22.551
<v Speaker 2>when they can't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

1267
01:02:22.551 --> 01:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>is that the rule?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't count the four I reserve,</v>

1268
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I reserve the term savage for somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that carb commits,</v>

1269
01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>atrocities against human beings.</v>

1270
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that rapes an eight year old </v>

1271
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're doing wholesale doing that.</v>

1272
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>And Isis is doing that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of their gig.</v>

1273
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1274
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1275
01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I reserve the term savages for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what steps did you guys have to take </v>

1276
01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:51.290
<v Speaker 2>to ensure that the seals and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>American soldiers were protected in </v>

1277
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 2>working with these people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1278
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.340
<v Speaker 2>you just have to keep your eye on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1279
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>and honestly at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1280
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1281
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen a lot more than Afghanistan,</v>

1282
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.630
<v Speaker 2>which was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call it,</v>

1283
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.410
<v Speaker 2>the color,</v>

1284
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I forget what they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a term for it,</v>

1285
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:15.111
<v Speaker 2>but when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the friendly allegedly friendly </v>

1286
01:03:15.111 --> 01:03:17.991
<v Speaker 2>Afghan soldier turns in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoots everyone in the back that </v>

1287
01:03:17.991 --> 01:03:20.541
<v Speaker 2>happened more later in Afghanistan and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were in Iraq it was pretty </v>

1288
01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 2>seldom that it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just had to be aware of it and we</v>

1289
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:22.860
<v Speaker 2>had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1290
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>you always had a guy that was standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the firing line and making sure that</v>

1291
01:03:26.071 --> 01:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>no one was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1292
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.790
<v Speaker 2>pulling their weapon out and aiming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

1293
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:31.470
<v Speaker 2>So that was a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1294
01:03:31.471 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta keep an eye on these guys.</v>

1295
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 2>You absolutely crazy added element and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

1296
01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's dichotomy and everything</v>

1297
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:42.600
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have some guy that was,</v>

1298
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Iraqi soldier that was willing to </v>

1299
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>take a bullet for your buddy.</v>

1300
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes war so complex.</v>

1301
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:54.090
<v Speaker 2>And confusing is it's not cut and dry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it never is.</v>

1302
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So how did it start panning out once you</v>
<v Speaker 2>started this cs?</v>

1303
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Clear hold and build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tough fight.</v>

1304
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Basically with every one of these combat</v>
<v Speaker 2>outposts,</v>

1305
01:04:07.561 --> 01:04:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that's what we ended up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1306
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.440
<v Speaker 2>what they ended up calling these combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>outposts.</v>

1307
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Every one of them was a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty tough fight to the revit.</v>

1308
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Their buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're calling them combat APA,</v>

1309
01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 2>combat outposts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of the 10 stories,</v>

1310
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 2>like how many stories are these </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings?</v>

1311
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Most of them were two or three stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three stories.</v>

1312
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 2>And so you set up a perimeter around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

1313
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Key people stationed in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns at the windows,</v>

1314
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.710
<v Speaker 2>looking out constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would be it.</v>

1315
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.960
<v Speaker 2>We take the building down and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do a massive construction project </v>

1316
01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of a combat zone.</v>

1317
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So these army engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless them all would roll down there</v>

1318
01:04:40.321 --> 01:04:45.321
<v Speaker 2>with their bulldozers and there they put</v>
<v Speaker 2>these big concrete barriers up and they </v>

1319
01:04:45.321 --> 01:04:48.300
<v Speaker 2>put sand bags and all the windows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they build machine gun nests on top.</v>

1320
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.090
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing this in the middle of like</v>

1321
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1322
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd have this secure combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>outpost and while they were doing that,</v>

1323
01:04:56.071 --> 01:05:01.071
<v Speaker 2>this is sort of was our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our addition to this type of operation </v>

1324
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>was while they were doing this big </v>
<v Speaker 2>construction progress project,</v>

1325
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:08.811
<v Speaker 2>obviously the situation was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable for the American forces and </v>

1326
01:05:08.811 --> 01:05:12.921
<v Speaker 2>so what we would do is I would push our </v>
<v Speaker 2>seals out into perimeter buildings that </v>

1327
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:20.181
<v Speaker 2>were maybe 200 or 300 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when the enemy would come to </v>

1328
01:05:20.181 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd kill them.</v>

1329
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.640
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy scene that must've been to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be taking these buildings and then </v>

1330
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.390
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing them and turning them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>military bases.</v>

1331
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>And then one after another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You doing this to.</v>

1332
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1333
01:05:31.691 --> 01:05:32.920
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an awesome effort.</v>

1334
01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.940
<v Speaker 2>And I think a good number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put in one combat outposts and there </v>

1335
01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:37.940
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1336
01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>army engineers put in 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>sandbags in one combat outpost,</v>

1337
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>like three buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just all good things.</v>

1338
01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>A lot of sand out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1339
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>

1340
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how many buildings did you guys </v>

1341
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:53.340
<v Speaker 2>wind up taking overall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1342
01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:58.170
<v Speaker 2>probably probably a total of like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat outposts,</v>

1343
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.630
<v Speaker 2>each one having to three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>

1344
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.940
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me clarify when I say we,</v>

1345
01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about this massive effort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one one aed,</v>

1346
01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>which is the First Brigade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Armored Division and all the </v>

1347
01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.760
<v Speaker 2>battalions that were underneath them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including one Marine Corps Battalion.</v>

1348
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.440
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I'm pointing that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1349
01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys were just unbelievable years.</v>

1350
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 2>They really were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were awesome.</v>

1351
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.680
<v Speaker 2>You choked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1352
01:06:28.681 --> 01:06:30.390
<v Speaker 2>these guys were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys were awesome.</v>

1353
01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:36.610
<v Speaker 2>They really were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1354
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:40.300
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>attachment that you have to that.</v>

1355
01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1356
01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1357
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you can look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can google navy seals and find,</v>

1358
01:06:49.641 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20,</v>

1359
01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>million new stories about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1360
01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these guys,</v>

1361
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1362
01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>to have seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1363
01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.510
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.480
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1365
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about earlier how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seals,</v>

1366
01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys like me,</v>

1367
01:07:10.701 --> 01:07:12.680
<v Speaker 2>this is what we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1368
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.790
<v Speaker 2>these guys didn't all necessarily have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that attitude.</v>

1369
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys that were in Ramadi with us </v>

1370
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.601
<v Speaker 2>when we first got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were reserve unit out of </v>

1371
01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two to eight iron soldiers.</v>

1372
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:28.940
<v Speaker 2>They were reservists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys were teachers that like,</v>

1373
01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:31.400
<v Speaker 2>like what you see when they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these reserves.</v>

1374
01:07:31.401 --> 01:07:34.700
<v Speaker 2>These guys were teachers and professors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1375
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:39.850
<v Speaker 2>bakers and they had real jobs and real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and wanting to get home to their </v>

1376
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:43.031
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet they were there grinding it out </v>

1377
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:43.031
<v Speaker 2>against a hardened enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1378
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:43.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1379
01:07:43.731 --> 01:07:44.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1380
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1381
01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy thing to see and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very humbling to be around people </v>

1382
01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:52.760
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

1383
01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>How long did this battle go on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle for Ramada?</v>

1384
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got there,</v>

1385
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1386
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.940
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two to eight had been there for 14 </v>

1387
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourteen months on the ground.</v>

1388
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Last around 100 guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 94.</v>

1389
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the [inaudible] came in in May </v>

1390
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:21.190
<v Speaker 2>and implemented c's clear hold and build</v>
<v Speaker 2>in by the time,</v>

1391
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I left October 20,</v>

1392
01:08:23.571 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>first 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the,</v>

1393
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>by January of 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle was for most,</v>

1394
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 2>for the most part over and these enemy </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks that had been,</v>

1395
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we were there,</v>

1396
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 2>30 to 50 a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down to like one a day and then one</v>

1397
01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:45.330
<v Speaker 2>week and then one a month and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1398
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have pictures of probably about six to</v>

1399
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:55.091
<v Speaker 2>nine months after we left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got pictures that guy sent back to </v>

1400
01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:57.410
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were running road races down the</v>

1401
01:08:57.411 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were the worst areas?</v>

1402
01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Ramadi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were playing soccer games.</v>

1403
01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 2>There was people out in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was guys,</v>

1404
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.770
<v Speaker 2>seals or not seals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but soldiers with no body armor on,</v>

1405
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.320
<v Speaker 2>just walking around meeting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

1406
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:14.410
<v Speaker 2>it was a miraculous turnaround and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of Ramadi that we had fought to </v>

1407
01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:18.761
<v Speaker 2>support and help or were joyous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're had a stable city to live in and </v>

1408
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 2>we're ready to carry on with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

1409
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:27.220
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think stories like this get left out </v>

1410
01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:27.980
<v Speaker 2>of the mainstream narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do.</v>

1411
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 2>The most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me included,</v>

1412
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:33.260
<v Speaker 2>just don't know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't aware of it.</v>

1413
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Have a very insulated idea of what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>war was about,</v>

1414
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:43.930
<v Speaker 2>what happened over there and what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pros and cons of this war and what </v>

1415
01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:48.611
<v Speaker 2>are the pros and cons of taking a city </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this and turning it into a </v>

1416
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 2>relatively safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relatively.</v>

1417
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely a safe place.</v>

1418
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.610
<v Speaker 2>There was less murders there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nerves and Detroit.</v>

1419
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

1420
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.810
<v Speaker 2>it was a complete turnaround and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

1421
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 2>you can do that because the people there</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be stable.</v>

1422
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:08.830
<v Speaker 2>They wanted that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted peace and they wanted </v>

1423
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.830
<v Speaker 2>freedom and they wanted the insurgents </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1424
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:09.980
<v Speaker 2>They absolutely wanted the insurgents </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1425
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that most people in America</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a distorted perception of,</v>

1426
01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.020
<v Speaker 2>of the military in general and of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war in particular?</v>

1427
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it's hard for me to give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of what civilians think,</v>

1428
01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1429
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.880
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1430
01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:31.870
<v Speaker 2>it's really easy to slip into like just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a straight John j Rambo,</v>

1431
01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no friendly civilians.</v>

1432
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>It's really easy to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1433
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:41.540
<v Speaker 2>but definitely when I hear various </v>
<v Speaker 2>people talking and you go,</v>

1434
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:45.510
<v Speaker 2>this person has no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person has no idea the,</v>

1435
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because they'll clump the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of Iraq,</v>

1436
01:10:48.951 --> 01:10:53.951
<v Speaker 2>they'll clump those people together as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>group and it's the wrong.</v>

1437
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>They have the wrong impression of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are like,</v>

1438
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:57.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1439
01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:02.260
<v Speaker 2>and guys that have been to Iraq and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone into houses and talk to the local </v>

1440
01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.000
<v Speaker 2>populace there and broke bread with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drank their tea.</v>

1441
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.380
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that these people,</v>

1442
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.800
<v Speaker 2>these people definitely wanted us there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I hear this thing about,</v>

1443
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't want us there and we </v>

1444
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.830
<v Speaker 2>were occupying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1445
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.830
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1446
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:19.120
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was times where the weed kill an </v>

1447
01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:19.120
<v Speaker 2>insurgent and they would cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would cheer.</v>

1448
01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Like thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you for killing that person.</v>

1449
01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:23.340
<v Speaker 2>He was a terrorist and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1450
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to rape my daughter.</v>

1451
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 2>They were happy we were there.</v>

1452
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.820
<v Speaker 2>What is Ramadi like now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been overrun by Isis.</v>

1453
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.880
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep saying now that there's going </v>

1454
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.080
<v Speaker 2>to be an effort by the Iraqi military to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it back and God blessed them and </v>

1455
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:46.551
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have to do the exact same </v>

1456
01:11:46.551 --> 01:11:48.951
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to do the exact </v>

1457
01:11:48.951 --> 01:11:48.951
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be it's gonna be tough.</v>

1458
01:11:48.951 --> 01:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be really tough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the United States military force</v>

1459
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 2>backing them up and leading something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1460
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:58.110
<v Speaker 2>do you think that's even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be difficult.</v>

1461
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 2>It is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is absolutely going to be difficult.</v>

1462
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that again,</v>

1463
01:12:05.891 --> 01:12:10.891
<v Speaker 2>you know and leadership and leadership </v>
<v Speaker 2>is such an important thing.</v>

1464
01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 2>It's such an important thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really does change.</v>

1465
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.660
<v Speaker 2>It changes every variable in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when you have good leaders,</v>

1466
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.880
<v Speaker 2>you you can win and I don't know who in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular is in charge of this Iraqi </v>

1467
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.820
<v Speaker 2>force that's going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Iraqis have some very strong </v>

1468
01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.880
<v Speaker 2>leadership and if they've got the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>person in position,</v>

1469
01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:44.210
<v Speaker 2>they will be able to take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now America has absolutely has </v>

1470
01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.150
<v Speaker 2>incredible military leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some incredible military leaders,</v>

1471
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 2>and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to step up and lead of an </v>

1472
01:12:54.941 --> 01:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>assault like that on a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean American leadership would be,</v>

1473
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 2>would absolutely make a change and would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be extremely positive for the situation </v>

1474
01:13:05.771 --> 01:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that America should go back</v>

1475
01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:08.680
<v Speaker 2>into Iraq?</v>

1476
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1477
01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:16.240
<v Speaker 2>we're already back in Iraq were on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

1478
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:17.770
<v Speaker 2>We got 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops there.</v>

1479
01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:23.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to answer your question with </v>

1480
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:27.841
<v Speaker 2>a philosophical answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but war is very difficult and very </v>

1481
01:13:34.151 --> 01:13:39.151
<v Speaker 2>tragic and very evil in its own right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you should be very,</v>

1482
01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>very cautious about pulling that trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and initiating a war because horrible </v>

1483
01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:56.610
<v Speaker 2>things are going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible things are gonna happen.</v>

1484
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Enemy are going to be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly are going to be killed.</v>

1485
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Americans are gonna be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Civilians are going to be killed.</v>

1486
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.580
<v Speaker 2>This idea that we're going to go into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a worn urban environment and we're not </v>

1487
01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.661
<v Speaker 2>going to kill any civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No civilians are going to die and you </v>

1488
01:14:14.661 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 2>have to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1489
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this when people ask me </v>
<v Speaker 2>this question,</v>

1490
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.180
<v Speaker 2>there is two types of will that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have if you're going to go to war to </v>

1491
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:33.661
<v Speaker 2>types of will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is the will to kill people and like </v>

1492
01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:40.231
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be enemy and you're going </v>

1493
01:14:40.231 --> 01:14:42.581
<v Speaker 2>to focus as much as you can on killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the enemy in some civilians are going to</v>

1494
01:14:43.281 --> 01:14:45.770
<v Speaker 2>die there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what is going to happen.</v>

1495
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:49.820
<v Speaker 2>And you have to understand that that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what you are getting into.</v>

1496
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:55.990
<v Speaker 2>So you have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have the will to kill and</v>

1497
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you also have to have the will to die </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Americans are going to die and </v>

1498
01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:13.670
<v Speaker 2>young men are going to come home in </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffins and that's a horrible thing.</v>

1499
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:25.450
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're going to go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be going to war</v>

1500
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:34.270
<v Speaker 2>with a clear vision to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win.</v>

1501
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:42.850
<v Speaker 2>And I think if we have the will and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a plan on,</v>

1502
01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:48.470
<v Speaker 2>on winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we should.</v>

1503
01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.400
<v Speaker 2>We should execute that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we're hesitant and if we don't </v>

1504
01:15:54.741 --> 01:15:59.741
<v Speaker 2>have the will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we should stand by until we develop</v>

1505
01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:04.520
<v Speaker 2>that will and we can sit outside and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can shape and we can.</v>

1506
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>We can try and shape events which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

1507
01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.230
<v Speaker 2>We should have a leadership role in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1508
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 2>We should be looking out for American </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>

1509
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds like taboo language </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this day and age,</v>

1510
01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:20.141
<v Speaker 2>but we're America and we should look out</v>
<v Speaker 2>for American interests around the world.</v>

1511
01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:25.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what we should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1512
01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:30.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what other countries are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking out for their interests </v>

1513
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.360
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're all looking out for our own </v>

1514
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.581
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a balance and things can move </v>

1515
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:39.851
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think right now with the </v>

1516
01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:42.020
<v Speaker 2>limited amount of troops that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq,</v>

1517
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said 3,500</v>

1518
01:16:43.731 --> 01:16:45.890
<v Speaker 2>now at one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it at the height?</v>

1519
01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over $100,000.</v>

1520
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the hightest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably even close to 200,000.</v>

1521
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 2>What would it take to develop that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you talk of?</v>

1522
01:16:57.590 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to see some other Paris like </v>

1523
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:07.271
<v Speaker 2>event?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we already had September 11th,</v>

1524
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>they killed 3000 of our</v>

1525
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>people on our home soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1526
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but that was 14 years ago and for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that might as well be another </v>

1527
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.430
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

1528
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1529
01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1530
01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I got to ask the other day about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning signs,</v>

1531
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1532
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Are we paying enough attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning signs or are there enough </v>

1533
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:33.600
<v Speaker 1>warning signs in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1534
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I kind of shake my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1535
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:40.211
<v Speaker 1>what more warning signs do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then go watch youtube videos and they're</v>

1536
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are coming to kill you.</v>

1537
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.870
<v Speaker 1>We are going to destroy you all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1538
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:49.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the warning right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The warning has been issued.</v>

1539
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Standby for people like me that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on the outside of the </v>

1540
01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.440
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like isis came out of nowhere.</v>

1541
01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:01.880
<v Speaker 1>It seems like once Arab spring started </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

1542
01:18:01.881 --> 01:18:06.881
<v Speaker 1>we started pulling out of Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you started hearing </v>

1543
01:18:06.881 --> 01:18:10.271
<v Speaker 1>about the isl or Isi or isis varies.</v>

1544
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.060
<v Speaker 1>They use the term Isi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

1545
01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:19.061
<v Speaker 1>which was ice Islamic state Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use that and I think 2007 was the </v>

1546
01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:23.321
<v Speaker 1>first time they use that as they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a area over in Syria.</v>

1547
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:27.020
<v Speaker 1>They threw the l on the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Lavonne,</v>

1548
01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 1>which is the historical name for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that region and the other one is Syria.</v>

1549
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:36.641
<v Speaker 1>The SS is so it's the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same people that were there and</v>

1550
01:18:37.341 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 1>will continue to be there until we route</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

1551
01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 1>What the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was getting at was that it wasn't</v>

1552
01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:46.250
<v Speaker 1>something that anybody here had heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as an organized thing.</v>

1553
01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:51.251
<v Speaker 1>We had heard about insurgents in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had never heard of it in in a </v>

1554
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 1>like with a name like like Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that it's a name,</v>

1555
01:18:55.821 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like an identifiable enemy and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a war against terrorism,</v>

1556
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I think kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaks Americans out,</v>

1557
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.620
<v Speaker 1>especially those that don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with the military,</v>

1558
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>is this idea of a war against terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1559
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 1>is this open ended proposition?</v>

1560
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.420
<v Speaker 1>There is no enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>like the Er,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1562
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:20.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no definitive end to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Japan surrendered,</v>

1563
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 1>World War II was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were kissing in the streets,</v>

1564
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:28.241
<v Speaker 1>that iconic image of the sailor kissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend in the street that we </v>

1565
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:34.061
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that happened for us in this </v>

1566
01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:37.511
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no definitive ending and when </v>

1567
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:41.110
<v Speaker 1>we've pulled out of Iraq and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning on pulling out of Afghanistan </v>

1568
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and then we see isis build up and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and stronger and scarier and we </v>

1569
01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:49.541
<v Speaker 1>see what happened in Paris and we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Lebanon and in Nigeria </v>

1570
01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:52.850
<v Speaker 1>and we see these terrorist attacks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

1571
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 1>well wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is this?</v>

1572
01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Is there ever going to be a point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a soldier and his girlfriend </v>

1573
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>kissing in the street is they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an end.</v>

1574
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Is there going to be a confetti </v>
<v Speaker 1>billowing in the main street?</v>

1575
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And a parade doesn't</v>

1576
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>seem like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's an accurate </v>

1577
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>assessment that it doesn't seem like it.</v>

1578
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.540
<v Speaker 2>We got a long fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1580
01:20:16.541 --> 01:20:18.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you asked where did isis,</v>

1581
01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:20.560
<v Speaker 2>how do we start hearing about them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1582
01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the same thing we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

1583
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:27.520
<v Speaker 2>They've got social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're aiming it at,</v>

1585
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disenchanted people all around the </v>

1586
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:36.811
<v Speaker 2>world that can cling onto something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will give them some sort of a identity.</v>

1587
01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the most bizarre things </v>

1588
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.531
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see people like these young </v>

1589
01:20:46.531 --> 01:20:47.770
<v Speaker 2>girls from the UK joining Isis and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1590
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.440
<v Speaker 2>they're escaping their country and going</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there and joining isis.</v>

1591
01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is happening here?</v>

1592
01:20:54.011 --> 01:20:59.011
<v Speaker 2>Like how disenchanted do you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>where that looks attractive to you?</v>

1593
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:04.480
<v Speaker 2>The two girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you saw this in the two poster </v>

1594
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:04.480
<v Speaker 2>girls for Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1595
01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 2>one of them died three to six months ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just got the latest report on </v>

1596
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.950
<v Speaker 2>the other one that was trying to escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis and they beat her to death.</v>

1597
01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did me</v>

1598
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:22.220
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be a growing force in a more</v>

1599
01:21:22.221 --> 01:21:25.730
<v Speaker 2>dangerous force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day I got,</v>

1600
01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.320
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was on twitter,</v>

1601
01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:29.480
<v Speaker 2>someone hit me the other day on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1602
01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an idea and you can't bomb ideas</v>

1603
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.400
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the statement to me and you know,</v>

1604
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I try and avoid getting into these </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive sort of political debates or </v>

1605
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1606
01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:49.360
<v Speaker 2>especially with 140 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that being said,</v>

1607
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:50.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1608
01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Nazi-ism was an idea that was defeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>through military force.</v>

1609
01:21:57.610 --> 01:22:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Slavery in America was an idea that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeated by military force.</v>

1610
01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Imperial Japan was an idea and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion that was defeated by military </v>

1611
01:22:08.891 --> 01:22:13.891
<v Speaker 2>force and none of those ideas would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped without military force.</v>

1612
01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:20.020
<v Speaker 2>And this is an idea that can be defeated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with bombs.</v>

1613
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And this is also an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately in this country gets </v>

1614
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:28.480
<v Speaker 2>connected to all Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea behind what these people are do</v>

1615
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.590
<v Speaker 2>or doing gets connected to all Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in reality,</v>

1616
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:37.830
<v Speaker 2>most of the Muslims in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want something like isis to </v>

1617
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:42.271
<v Speaker 2>be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be in a perpetual </v>

1618
01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:44.881
<v Speaker 2>state of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to have to worry about </v>

1619
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:46.270
<v Speaker 2>these quote unquote savages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing,</v>

1620
01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the isis has killed hundreds of </v>

1621
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>thousands of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1622
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what the number is,</v>

1623
01:22:53.651 --> 01:22:57.520
<v Speaker 2>but we know that isis has killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>

1624
01:22:57.521 --> 01:22:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1625
01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:03.541
<v Speaker 2>they went into Ramadi and killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds of Muslims that </v>

1626
01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:07.591
<v Speaker 2>had worked in some way with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coalition forces that they could have a </v>

1627
01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:07.660
<v Speaker 2>peaceful city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They murdered them all.</v>

1628
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>So let's say Donald Trump becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>president and uh,</v>

1629
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.950
<v Speaker 2>he listens to your podcast with Tim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferriss and he read your book and he </v>

1630
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.950
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jocko,</v>

1631
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming to you for advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I do?</v>

1632
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I said Donald Trump for</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1633
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:23.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that that's our own isis.</v>

1634
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Let's whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fill in the blank.</v>

1635
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:31.420
<v Speaker 2>New President person becomes a known </v>
<v Speaker 2>size head person.</v>

1636
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even go with woman or man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1637
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.610
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do if you were,</v>

1638
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:41.611
<v Speaker 2>if you were in a leadership position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in a position to make a </v>

1639
01:23:41.611 --> 01:23:43.440
<v Speaker 2>decision or to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1640
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 2>to start a process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do?</v>

1641
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 2>We would destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just go right back in.</v>

1642
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 2>We would destroy them and you think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what America should do right now?</v>

1643
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1644
01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:03.120
<v Speaker 2>It is a cancer that is growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is malignant and it needs to be </v>

1645
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.370
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what steps would you take?</v>

1646
01:24:06.371 --> 01:24:11.371
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do if you were in a </v>

1647
01:24:11.371 --> 01:24:11.371
<v Speaker 2>position of power right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1648
01:24:11.371 --> 01:24:15.840
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get this idea that this is some </v>

1649
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.760
<v Speaker 2>crazy complex situation and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be all hard and all this.</v>

1650
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I could pull together like two first </v>
<v Speaker 2>lieutenants from the Marine Corps,</v>

1651
01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:26.680
<v Speaker 2>which is like the junior officer in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marine corps and say come up with a plan</v>

1652
01:24:26.681 --> 01:24:31.681
<v Speaker 2>to defeat isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got two hours and they do it and </v>

1653
01:24:31.681 --> 01:24:32.770
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a complex situation.</v>

1654
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:35.470
<v Speaker 2>How many people you're dealing with when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talking about Isis?</v>

1655
01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty thousand,</v>

1656
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:40.990
<v Speaker 2>10,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>4,000.</v>

1657
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:43.660
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff to tell it.</v>

1658
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to tell.</v>

1659
01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:45.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You assess it,</v>

1660
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you make you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring what you need to the table and</v>

1661
01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:53.881
<v Speaker 2>you defeat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think is holding back </v>

1662
01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:54.070
<v Speaker 2>from us doing something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

1663
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Is it frustrating to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1664
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Because if you got kids and you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1665
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.880
<v Speaker 2>a malignant cancer on humanity that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing unchecked when we have,</v>

1666
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like the master surgeons that have</v>

1667
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:19.471
<v Speaker 2>the ability to go in and eradicate this </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and instead of doing that we're </v>

1668
01:25:19.471 --> 01:25:20.890
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just not doing anything.</v>

1669
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:25.210
<v Speaker 2>So do you blame this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current administration?</v>

1670
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you blame the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the climate of the American public right</v>

1671
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:35.011
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The political climate where people just </v>

1672
01:25:35.011 --> 01:25:37.141
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be involved in another war</v>
<v Speaker 2>or enter into another prolonged </v>

1673
01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:41.521
<v Speaker 2>interaction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are always looking for </v>

1674
01:25:41.521 --> 01:25:44.560
<v Speaker 2>the easiest way out and going in as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard decision to make.</v>

1675
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:50.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a very hard decision to make and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's be very unpopular decision and it </v>

1676
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 2>would be the short term pain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's afraid of.</v>

1677
01:25:55.570 --> 01:26:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what one of the things that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconcerting to me about drones because</v>

1678
01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that what drones are is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way</v>

1679
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that we can avoid American casualties so</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't complain about it as much.</v>

1680
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.380
<v Speaker 1>So we send this robot in there to fly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then launch missiles and the good </v>

1681
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>thing is it doesn't create American </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>

1682
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>but the bad thing is it doesn't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be nearly as effective.</v>

1683
01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a wishy washy attempt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways at war it seems almost like it</v>

1684
01:26:27.231 --> 01:26:30.950
<v Speaker 1>would be something that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would use in a supplement as,</v>

1685
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:36.010
<v Speaker 1>as well as a military attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would be a part of it instead </v>

1686
01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:38.150
<v Speaker 1>of being the only thing that you used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to combat these people.</v>

1687
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we have enough drones to</v>

1688
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:45.881
<v Speaker 1>get the job done and they're effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean a drone is going to take out.</v>

1689
01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty,</v>

1690
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 1>20 bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'd be a lot of drones in action.</v>

1691
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability yet,</v>

1692
01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.800
<v Speaker 1>but we will someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1693
01:26:56.910 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 1>someday we'll have a robot army and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be dealing with some terminator </v>

1694
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 1>type situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1695
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now it's almost like a,</v>

1696
01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 1>we need to get smacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like something needs to happen before we</v>

1697
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:13.541
<v Speaker 1>hit back and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot in good conscience agree with </v>

1698
01:27:13.541 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you because I don't even want to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>those words.</v>

1699
01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1700
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to put it out.</v>

1701
01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you start talking about </v>

1703
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:24.560
<v Speaker 1>a dirty bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1704
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1705
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:30.341
<v Speaker 1>here's a sector of America that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>can live in anymore because it's been </v>

1706
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 1>contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's radioactive now mean.</v>

1707
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1708
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 1>for some reason the warning signs which </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be seen,</v>

1709
01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere you look,</v>

1710
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.290
<v Speaker 1>we're ignoring them.</v>

1711
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I think people mean speaking for myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and speaking for the people that I come </v>

1712
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:55.151
<v Speaker 1>in contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are becoming more and </v>

1713
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:55.430
<v Speaker 1>more concerned about isis on a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much daily basis.</v>

1714
01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing that Paris did do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it woke a lot of people up as two </v>

1715
01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.631
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that something like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen and that this isn't the end </v>

1716
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:09.720
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ramping up and if they have the </v>

1717
01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.160
<v Speaker 1>kind of resources to pull off something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Paris attacks,</v>

1718
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 1>who knows where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally agree with you.</v>

1719
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.500
<v Speaker 1>It is a very scary time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is going to happen if </v>

1720
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:24.161
<v Speaker 1>you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I think is going to happen in </v>

1721
01:28:24.161 --> 01:28:25.400
<v Speaker 1>terms of the terrorist attack in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>

1722
01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:25.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1723
01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:29.960
<v Speaker 1>In terms of our approach to dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like Isis.</v>

1724
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult to predict </v>

1725
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.901
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not not to be just a big cop out </v>

1726
01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to do that to you,</v>

1727
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but there's so many different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this could go and you know,</v>

1728
01:28:47.211 --> 01:28:52.211
<v Speaker 1>now you've thrown Russia into the mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they took down the Russian </v>

1729
01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:56.111
<v Speaker 1>airline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a guy like Putin who is a </v>

1730
01:28:56.111 --> 01:28:56.111
<v Speaker 1>gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1731
01:28:56.111 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and I say that in both contexts of have </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive.</v>

1732
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy</v>

1733
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 2>in a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a gangster that's,</v>

1734
01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:09.150
<v Speaker 2>that's like scary with his thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and at the same time like props,</v>

1735
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:14.210
<v Speaker 2>the guy's a gangster and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smash them people you've got now,</v>

1736
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Turkey in the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1737
01:29:15.931 --> 01:29:20.931
<v Speaker 2>it's just a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complex situation that's getting </v>

1738
01:29:20.931 --> 01:29:24.441
<v Speaker 2>more complex all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the scariest part about it is that </v>

1739
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:30.950
<v Speaker 2>America is not in a leadership position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not influencing the world the way</v>

1740
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 2>we once did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not.</v>

1741
01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:38.810
<v Speaker 2>People are not looking to us as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the leaders there were in the </v>

1742
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:41.700
<v Speaker 2>backseat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's scary.</v>

1743
01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:45.000
<v Speaker 2>We should be in a leadership position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1744
01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Is Not bad to have a benevolent country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1745
01:29:51.431 --> 01:29:54.190
<v Speaker 2>and I know people are going to go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1746
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:59.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally benevolent country that's </v>

1747
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.330
<v Speaker 2>sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1748
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:00.960
<v Speaker 2>given billions of dollars of aid around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1749
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 2>never taken any soil and kept it.</v>

1750
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1751
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:08.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess in modern times we've never </v>

1752
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:10.500
<v Speaker 2>taken any soil and kept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've given Germany back to Jeremy.</v>

1753
01:30:10.501 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 2>We gave Japan back to Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1754
01:30:12.121 --> 01:30:13.110
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1755
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.370
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a fairly benevolent country.</v>

1756
01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we've got faults,</v>

1757
01:30:18.811 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I know we've done things wrong in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

1758
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we'll do things wrong in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

1759
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:27.530
<v Speaker 2>but to have us not in a leadership </v>
<v Speaker 2>position is a very disturbing time.</v>

1760
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.490
<v Speaker 2>And when you say that we're not in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership position,</v>

1761
01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:35.370
<v Speaker 2>what do you think the shift is and where</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think had happened?</v>

1762
01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been happening and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1763
01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I think the current administration is </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not,</v>

1764
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:48.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as experienced as you would hope and I </v>

1765
01:30:48.230 --> 01:30:52.001
<v Speaker 2>think there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of naive attitudes about what the </v>

1766
01:30:52.001 --> 01:30:55.241
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this administration you think was the</v>

1767
01:30:55.681 --> 01:30:59.310
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the shift away from America</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in a leadership position?</v>

1768
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

1769
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:03.360
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a president do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>would change that?</v>

1770
01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that has a better understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the nature of the world,</v>

1771
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 2>like a John McCain type guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1773
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.260
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1774
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:21.350
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sit here and try and </v>

1775
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 2>think of who the best presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate would be.</v>

1776
01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a hard time figuring that out in</v>

1777
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.890
<v Speaker 2>America as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1778
01:31:25.891 --> 01:31:30.891
<v Speaker 2>you look at a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at a guy like Putin and you </v>

1779
01:31:30.891 --> 01:31:32.960
<v Speaker 2>look at a guy like Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin's</v>

1780
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.980
<v Speaker 2>whole existence has been geared towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1781
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A KGB guy.</v>

1782
01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been a player on the world stage </v>

1783
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.931
<v Speaker 2>and a part of it for his whole life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got an acute understanding of it </v>

1784
01:31:47.931 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 2>and he's a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1785
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>he's a legit black belt and you just see</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other,</v>

1786
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:55.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1787
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the naivete of,</v>

1788
01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.400
<v Speaker 2>of this administration.</v>

1789
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1790
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:03.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to understand.</v>

1791
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It was one thing that Obama said it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday or today that just drove me </v>

1792
01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:13.231
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about the attack on </v>

1793
01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:14.230
<v Speaker 1>planned parenthood in Colorado Springs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said things like,</v>

1794
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 1>this don't happen in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1795
01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.920
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just days after what happened in Paris,</v>

1796
01:32:20.921 --> 01:32:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I was reading that just today before we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started the podcast.</v>

1797
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I was reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1798
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:30.331
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the craziest things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could say after hundreds of </v>

1799
01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:34.321
<v Speaker 1>people were killed in Paris because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it in terms of gun </v>

1800
01:32:34.321 --> 01:32:38.191
<v Speaker 1>violence from a religious perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what the fuck happened in Paris?</v>

1801
01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.490
<v Speaker 1>What it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not about babies.</v>

1802
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.660
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

1803
01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1804
01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:48.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something the other day too was </v>

1805
01:32:48.891 --> 01:32:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in some notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America leading and winning.</v>

1806
01:32:53.670 --> 01:32:56.370
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1807
01:32:56.610 --> 01:32:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1808
01:32:57.391 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1809
01:32:59.550 --> 01:33:00.300
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1810
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1811
01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1812
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:10.200
<v Speaker 1>What did anybody ask him to qualify that</v>
<v Speaker 1>or knows one of bands kind of speaking?</v>

1813
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1814
01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird statement for the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the commander and chief of the </v>

1815
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 1>greatest army the world has ever known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in staying,</v>

1816
01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

1817
01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept of a benevolent leader,</v>

1818
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>the of a benevolent nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1819
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.090
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do concede that the world,</v>

1820
01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:39.091
<v Speaker 1>we're always being chaos and there will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always be at least in terms of like </v>

1821
01:33:39.091 --> 01:33:39.730
<v Speaker 1>foreseeable future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1822
01:33:39.731 --> 01:33:41.440
<v Speaker 1>the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years or whatever we're,</v>

1823
01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:46.490
<v Speaker 1>we're in until something crazy happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would have to be something </v>

1824
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:50.970
<v Speaker 1>monumental life changing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stops conflict all around the </v>

1825
01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to,</v>

1826
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 1>if you were rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic person and you're looking at </v>

1827
01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:56.370
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to say,</v>

1828
01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:56.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have conflict.</v>

1829
01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you look at places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Congo or parts of the Middle East </v>

1830
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:07.561
<v Speaker 1>where people don't count and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>places where like you would have to </v>

1831
01:34:07.561 --> 01:34:10.951
<v Speaker 1>educate them to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future would look radically different </v>

1832
01:34:11.141 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 1>than the present.</v>

1833
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>

1834
01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:18.360
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if conflict will be something that we're</v>

1835
01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>going to have to mitigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>

1836
01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't you want to be the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to decide?</v>

1837
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to be the person in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of power?</v>

1838
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be.</v>

1839
01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:32.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like the is a much smaller scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I've always tried to </v>

1840
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:38.070
<v Speaker 1>tell people when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to learn martial </v>

1841
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:40.531
<v Speaker 1>arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I always say is you don't want </v>

1842
01:34:40.531 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 1>to learn martial arts because you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go beat somebody up.</v>

1843
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.090
<v Speaker 1>You want to learn martial arts for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1844
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:48.091
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to learn how to </v>

1845
01:34:48.091 --> 01:34:50.191
<v Speaker 1>overcome incredibly difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in martial arts you're going to </v>

1846
01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 1>encountered times where you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>

1847
01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:57.541
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna get your ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be difficult and it's </v>

1848
01:34:57.541 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult to get good at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1849
01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:03.700
<v Speaker 1>If you do get into a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the one who gets to </v>

1850
01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:08.141
<v Speaker 1>choose whether or not someone gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be helpless because </v>

1851
01:35:08.141 --> 01:35:09.890
<v Speaker 1>being helpless is a terrible place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1852
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go out and fuck people </v>

1853
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.251
<v Speaker 1>up and that's sort of the same idea on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>macro scale that you would look at the </v>

1854
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:23.990
<v Speaker 1>concept of America being a benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 1>entity or benevolent superpower.</v>

1855
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>

1856
01:35:26.241 --> 01:35:26.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1857
01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1858
01:35:30.150 --> 01:35:30.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1859
01:35:30.871 --> 01:35:33.930
<v Speaker 3>it goes with everything that we do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I say we,</v>

1860
01:35:33.931 --> 01:35:34.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1861
01:35:34.711 --> 01:35:36.210
<v Speaker 3>you train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work out,</v>

1862
01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.310
<v Speaker 3>you try to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1863
01:35:38.311 --> 01:35:40.500
<v Speaker 3>you keep yourself aware of what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1864
01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not because you want to go around </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicking people's asses,</v>

1865
01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.170
<v Speaker 3>it's because you don't want to have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick everyone's ass.</v>

1866
01:35:46.171 --> 01:35:51.171
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are not looking at Joe Rogan be </v>

1867
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:51.171
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1868
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:51.171
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to beat him up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going out of that guy.</v>

1869
01:35:51.171 --> 01:35:52.620
<v Speaker 3>I know he trains all the time and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone gets in your face,</v>

1870
01:35:52.621 --> 01:35:55.830
<v Speaker 3>they're going to know that immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that when you can tell,</v>

1871
01:35:55.890 --> 01:35:59.280
<v Speaker 3>you can tell by the way someone carries </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves what,</v>

1872
01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:01.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they have and what they know,</v>

1873
01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:03.090
<v Speaker 3>what they understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1874
01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got asked the other day,</v>

1875
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.330
<v Speaker 3>if you were president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1876
01:36:06.331 --> 01:36:08.850
<v Speaker 3>you asked me if I was got advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said if you were president,</v>

1877
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:13.470
<v Speaker 3>what would you do with Isis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said if I was president,</v>

1878
01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Isis would not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>President Jocko happen.</v>

1879
01:36:17.850 --> 01:36:19.680
<v Speaker 3>They would not exist because</v>

1880
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:26.070
<v Speaker 1>we would have a presence in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would prevent the growth of this </v>

1881
01:36:26.291 --> 01:36:30.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of a reaction do you think</v>

1882
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you would have from the American public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the insulated American public?</v>

1883
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're with,</v>

1884
01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:40.890
<v Speaker 1>this is probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive times ever in terms of they </v>

1885
01:36:40.890 --> 01:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>throw around the term Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you even criticize anyone that just </v>

1886
01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:46.080
<v Speaker 1>happens to be Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're.</v>

1887
01:36:46.081 --> 01:36:50.290
<v Speaker 1>We're in a strange time when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly sensitive,</v>

1888
01:36:50.291 --> 01:36:55.291
<v Speaker 1>maybe hypersensitive people that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a good grip on reality.</v>

1889
01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

1890
01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Take them over there and buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:37:00.911 --> 01:37:01.930
<v Speaker 1>that'd be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the way.</v>

1892
01:37:02.490 --> 01:37:07.360
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about this</v>

1893
01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I fought alongside these Muslims.</v>

1894
01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I fought alongside them to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends did and America did.</v>

1895
01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:27.710
<v Speaker 1>We fought alongside these people to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>and help them and we did.</v>

1896
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:33.830
<v Speaker 1>So how that gets twisted in some world </v>
<v Speaker 1>to where you know,</v>

1897
01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:35.010
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

1898
01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:38.250
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're evil is completely beyond me.</v>

1899
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because there is legit </v>

1900
01:37:43.570 --> 01:37:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobia out there in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there's a.</v>

1901
01:37:43.570 --> 01:37:48.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a legit hatred of Christians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's legit hatred of Mormons.</v>

1902
01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find groups of people </v>

1903
01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 1>that are hated and there's also people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't willing to look deeper,</v>

1904
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:59.120
<v Speaker 1>deeper into some some global issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a global issue that there's </v>

1905
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:05.270
<v Speaker 1>these people that call themselves isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>or al or whatever they call themselves </v>

1906
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.590
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call themselves the Islamic state.</v>

1907
01:38:07.591 --> 01:38:08.860
<v Speaker 1>You Owe Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1908
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Islams bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are bad.</v>

1909
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching some thing.</v>

1910
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 1>There was A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris had posted up on twitter.</v>

1911
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.640
<v Speaker 1>There was this guy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in Virginia.</v>

1912
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 1>He was a at a like county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those meetings where you're </v>

1913
01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.060
<v Speaker 1>talking about building something in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>town and he was.</v>

1914
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.480
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about putting up a mosque</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people were screaming at him </v>

1915
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.041
<v Speaker 1>that Muslims are evil and you're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cult is not going to come into our town </v>

1916
01:38:40.041 --> 01:38:42.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to invade our town and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of here with your evil called.</v>

1917
01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1918
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That's Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right there.</v>

1919
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:51.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a peaceful guy who </v>

1920
01:38:51.171 --> 01:38:51.340
<v Speaker 1>just wants to be able to worship his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1921
01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 1>his ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his religion in peace in this place.</v>

1922
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:56.720
<v Speaker 1>He wants to build a mosque and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

1923
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're furious at this guy.</v>

1924
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 1>That's real Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1925
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:06.350
<v Speaker 1>But there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and what's going on </v>

1926
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.850
<v Speaker 1>in other parts of the world with Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A giant,</v>

1927
01:39:08.851 --> 01:39:13.851
<v Speaker 1>giant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that when people want to </v>

1928
01:39:13.851 --> 01:39:18.681
<v Speaker 1>throw around that term Islamophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times what they're </v>

1929
01:39:18.681 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 1>doing is they're just trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

1930
01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to be politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially correct,</v>

1931
01:39:23.171 --> 01:39:28.171
<v Speaker 1>that trying to be sensitive and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to let everybody know that </v>

1932
01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:28.510
<v Speaker 1>they're not racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobic,</v>

1933
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Islamophobic or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're open minded and </v>

1934
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:37.131
<v Speaker 1>progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're throwing around these terms </v>

1935
01:39:37.131 --> 01:39:37.131
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of clouds the water.</v>

1936
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are the,</v>

1937
01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:49.530
<v Speaker 2>these people are running around calling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1938
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1939
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:55.350
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever called me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>

1940
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they will get already today on </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>

1941
01:39:58.290 --> 01:40:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see them happening right now.</v>

1942
01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how he could,</v>

1943
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1944
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:04.950
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1945
01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:09.120
<v Speaker 2>we fought alongside Muslim people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ate with them,</v>

1946
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 2>we put our lives in their hands and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>put their hand,</v>

1947
01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:16.940
<v Speaker 2>their lives in our hands and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America and my friends were killed </v>

1948
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:23.121
<v Speaker 2>trying to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how I'm a person that could be called</v>

1949
01:40:23.611 --> 01:40:26.640
<v Speaker 2>an Islamophobia is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of a stretch I think.</v>

1950
01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it rationally,</v>

1951
01:40:28.251 --> 01:40:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't necessarily rational.</v>

1952
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1953
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:37.671
<v Speaker 2>people paint their own layers onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and make them into what they're </v>

1954
01:40:37.671 --> 01:40:37.740
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1955
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's symptomatic of what's going</v>

1956
01:40:40.021 --> 01:40:42.150
<v Speaker 1>on with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our culture too,</v>

1957
01:40:42.151 --> 01:40:47.151
<v Speaker 1>is that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these hypersensitive oversimplistic </v>

1958
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:52.190
<v Speaker 1>ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people that that would say these </v>

1959
01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:55.581
<v Speaker 1>things like this don't have a real grip </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have of what it's like over </v>

1960
01:40:57.881 --> 01:41:02.881
<v Speaker 1>there and I don't think anybody does </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than people like you that have </v>

1961
01:41:02.881 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 1>been over there and had been in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's possible.</v>

1962
01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

1963
01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.160
<v Speaker 1>We're behaving like children and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways because we really have never had</v>

1964
01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:14.970
<v Speaker 1>to live on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1965
01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:15.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1966
01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very similar to what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about earlier with the </v>

1967
01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:24.600
<v Speaker 1>traditional martial arts where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit there in your fantasy world and </v>

1968
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:30.181
<v Speaker 1>think that your ci is going to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and that as long as you spread love,</v>

1969
01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be protected because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ci is strong and until you've been </v>

1970
01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 1>in a fistfight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna believe that.</v>

1971
01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda like what you're saying.</v>

1972
01:41:39.431 --> 01:41:44.431
<v Speaker 1>Do we need to get spanked or do we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into a fistfight before America </v>

1973
01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:44.431
<v Speaker 1>realizes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1974
01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 1>there's real problems in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be handled.</v>

1975
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the weirdest times </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody have been in my act about,</v>

1976
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:54.571
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time ever where </v>

1977
01:41:54.571 --> 01:41:55.720
<v Speaker 1>someone broke into the White House or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that in 2014 was the first time</v>

1978
01:41:55.721 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 1>anybody had gained access and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman guardian,</v>

1979
01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:02.911
<v Speaker 1>front door was unarmed woman caught in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front door and a woman who's in </v>

1980
01:42:02.911 --> 01:42:06.481
<v Speaker 1>charge of secret service because </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity and one of my favorite parts </v>

1981
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:11.791
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an article written about when </v>

1982
01:42:11.791 --> 01:42:13.651
<v Speaker 1>the guy knocked the chick over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran inside and they said it was reviewed</v>

1983
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and gender wasn't an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1984
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:18.010
<v Speaker 1>we're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1985
01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 1>that makes lot of sense.</v>

1986
01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Like Brock Lesnar was guarding the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing would've happened.</v>

1987
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:24.600
<v Speaker 1>The guy would've knocked him over and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have.</v>

1988
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:29.910
<v Speaker 1>No one would have ever caught the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to ran by and that's </v>

1989
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:33.301
<v Speaker 1>fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's that same kind of crazy </v>

1990
01:42:33.301 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asinine thinking.</v>

1991
01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You should have a fucking team if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make the president sleep in a </v>

1992
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.501
<v Speaker 1>house that's in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should probably have a team of fucking </v>

1993
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:46.561
<v Speaker 1>assassins surrounding that building at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all times and you should keep a lookout </v>

1994
01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 1>for dudes that are sprinting across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawn,</v>

1995
01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.440
<v Speaker 1>knocking over chicks that are guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front door.</v>

1996
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:53.380
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same thing.</v>

1997
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're so soft and we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to being in this insulated world </v>

1998
01:42:58.661 --> 01:43:03.661
<v Speaker 1>that we have here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nice sweet bubble where we drive </v>

1999
01:43:03.661 --> 01:43:05.110
<v Speaker 1>our eight mile per hour or eight mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>per gallon suv.</v>

2000
01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you would ever really </v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminates all these problems that </v>

2001
01:43:12.671 --> 01:43:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you get get these.</v>

2002
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean to the hand of the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen,</v>

2003
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.210
<v Speaker 1>like in World War II that you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were 13 years old,</v>

2004
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.330
<v Speaker 1>we weren't old enough to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still knew that there was a war going</v>

2005
01:43:25.331 --> 01:43:29.050
<v Speaker 1>on because we couldn't eat steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't use any metal.</v>

2006
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:34.200
<v Speaker 1>We were gardening at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were shutting off the lights like we </v>

2007
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.021
<v Speaker 1>were impacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of America was impacted at the </v>

2008
01:43:37.021 --> 01:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>height of the battle of Ramadi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the height of it,</v>

2009
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 1>at the height of the war of Iraq at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>height of the war of Afghanistan,</v>

2010
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans at the mall.</v>

2011
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.440
<v Speaker 1>We're not impacted at all at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2012
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't even allowed to show </v>

2013
01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:52.830
<v Speaker 1>photographs of coffins,</v>

2014
01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:55.730
<v Speaker 2>so the first time ever in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

2015
01:43:55.731 --> 01:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>a history of the United States taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures during war time where they made</v>

2016
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:05.321
<v Speaker 2>it illegal to show photos of coffins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just absolutely insane.</v>

2017
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2018
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:12.920
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to let people </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's happening if you don't</v>

2019
01:44:12.921 --> 01:44:16.700
<v Speaker 2>even allow journalists to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs of coffins?</v>

2020
01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the bubble.</v>

2021
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:25.090
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the same situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What made you decide to leave the </v>

2022
01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:29.741
<v Speaker 2>military?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2023
01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.150
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2024
01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like one day I woke up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2025
01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:34.760
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

2026
01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2027
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:40.961
<v Speaker 2>obviously if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't caught this up to this </v>

2028
01:44:40.961 --> 01:44:40.961
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved.</v>

2029
01:44:40.961 --> 01:44:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I loved the seal teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:44:41.601 --> 01:44:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I loved being in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the 20 year mark.</v>

2031
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of different things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of weighed in,</v>

2032
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:56.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a family that I hadn't seen or </v>

2033
01:44:56.021 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't know pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you start thinking,</v>

2034
01:44:57.861 --> 01:44:58.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2035
01:44:58.990 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should pay attention to them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2036
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I had completed sort of my last real job</v>
<v Speaker 2>operational job in the seal teams and it</v>

2037
01:45:09.621 --> 01:45:12.380
<v Speaker 2>was going to be a long time before I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in command again,</v>

2038
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:17.410
<v Speaker 2>have a seal team or have something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was important and from a war fighting </v>

2039
01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:22.181
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of kind of another </v>

2040
01:45:22.181 --> 01:45:22.181
<v Speaker 2>thing that I looked at that was tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2041
01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2042
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.430
<v Speaker 2>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2043
01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:29.420
<v Speaker 2>That's it really.</v>

2044
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:36.970
<v Speaker 2>So what was your transition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago did you begin to get out?</v>

2045
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I got out in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2046
01:45:39.591 --> 01:45:41.630
<v Speaker 2>So this is five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years.</v>

2047
01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was your transition was?</v>

2048
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:49.750
<v Speaker 2>We uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started this company where we go and </v>

2049
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:53.180
<v Speaker 2>work with civilian companies doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>leadership and management and you know,</v>

2050
01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:58.181
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy life that I was talking about </v>

2051
01:45:58.181 --> 01:45:59.501
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was one of the platoon commanders </v>

2052
01:45:59.501 --> 01:45:59.501
<v Speaker 2>that was with me and Ramadi and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2053
01:45:59.501 --> 01:46:02.180
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had run into a company I had run into</v>

2054
01:46:02.181 --> 01:46:05.720
<v Speaker 2>a company and they asked us to do some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and the next thing you know,</v>

2055
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave one,</v>

2056
01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.000
<v Speaker 2>one kind of leadership training to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accompany and then they said,</v>

2057
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 2>come back and train all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>divisions.</v>

2058
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:15.320
<v Speaker 2>And then the parent company of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>company watched me and said,</v>

2059
01:46:15.321 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you come to our CEO Summit?</v>

2060
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:20.750
<v Speaker 2>And then went to the CEO Summit and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of those ceos said,</v>

2061
01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you come?</v>

2062
01:46:21.231 --> 01:46:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this.</v>

2063
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:25.730
<v Speaker 2>So what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the process like when you're,</v>

2064
01:46:25.731 --> 01:46:27.100
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2065
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.970
<v Speaker 2>these speeches are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're setting things up,</v>

2066
01:46:28.971 --> 01:46:33.971
<v Speaker 2>how do you organize them and what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you obviously your lifetime was in the </v>

2067
01:46:33.971 --> 01:46:34.540
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2068
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:39.700
<v Speaker 2>So what was it about you and about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you brought to the table that was so </v>

2069
01:46:39.891 --> 01:46:44.891
<v Speaker 2>attractive to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because the principles of </v>

2070
01:46:44.891 --> 01:46:48.671
<v Speaker 2>leadership and that's where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we talk about and that's </v>

2071
01:46:48.671 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>what we teach is leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The principals leadership do change</v>

2072
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.980
<v Speaker 3>whether you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether your mission is to capture kill </v>

2073
01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:58.401
<v Speaker 3>bad guys or whether your mission is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacture something or sell something </v>

2074
01:46:58.401 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 3>or produce something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to.</v>

2075
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:05.390
<v Speaker 3>You got a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>group of individuals and they're going </v>

2076
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:06.270
<v Speaker 3>to be diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be different.</v>

2077
01:47:06.271 --> 01:47:08.560
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence levels.</v>

2078
01:47:08.561 --> 01:47:09.880
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have different personalities,</v>

2079
01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:10.820
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have different goals,</v>

2080
01:47:10.821 --> 01:47:15.821
<v Speaker 3>are gonna have different motivations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to take all those people and </v>

2081
01:47:15.821 --> 01:47:19.941
<v Speaker 3>unify them and try and get them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish a mission in the most </v>

2082
01:47:19.941 --> 01:47:24.510
<v Speaker 3>effective and efficient manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's leadership and it does it.</v>

2083
01:47:24.511 --> 01:47:29.511
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that those principles that we used in </v>

2084
01:47:29.511 --> 01:47:32.241
<v Speaker 3>combat don't change regardless of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mission is and what,</v>

2085
01:47:32.541 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 3>what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2086
01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:38.271
<v Speaker 3>and I said this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is like combat but amplified and </v>

2087
01:47:38.281 --> 01:47:41.880
<v Speaker 3>intensified or combat is combat is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2088
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.320
<v Speaker 3>But amplified and intensified and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means when we tell a story,</v>

2089
01:47:46.321 --> 01:47:50.230
<v Speaker 3>like a leadership story about combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2090
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.040
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so obvious what the,</v>

2091
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:54.270
<v Speaker 3>what the principal was.</v>

2092
01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in the business world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might take six months or a year or </v>

2093
01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.300
<v Speaker 3>maybe you barely even notice what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure was,</v>

2094
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when we sit,</v>

2095
01:48:02.751 --> 01:48:07.751
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we make those stark examples from </v>

2096
01:48:07.751 --> 01:48:07.751
<v Speaker 3>combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go,</v>

2097
01:48:07.751 --> 01:48:07.751
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2098
01:48:07.751 --> 01:48:09.810
<v Speaker 3>I see how we're failing in this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

2099
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.150
<v Speaker 3>that's why I think people really took </v>
<v Speaker 3>hold of,</v>

2100
01:48:12.190 --> 01:48:17.190
<v Speaker 3>of what we did and how we put it across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was something that you were </v>

2101
01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:20.180
<v Speaker 3>approached to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't an idea that you had had and</v>

2102
01:48:20.181 --> 01:48:22.170
<v Speaker 3>you thought about this will be my new </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2103
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:22.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

2104
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:28.010
<v Speaker 3>regardless of all this garbage that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk in my life and I've always telling </v>

2105
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.590
<v Speaker 3>people to like plan and be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2106
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:33.591
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost completely fell into this with </v>

2107
01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:33.591
<v Speaker 3>the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2108
01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2109
01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 3>can you come and talk to my people about</v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership?</v>

2110
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2111
01:48:36.241 --> 01:48:41.241
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about leadership for </v>

2112
01:48:41.241 --> 01:48:42.030
<v Speaker 3>last several years in the seal teams and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in leadership position in some</v>

2113
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:46.860
<v Speaker 3>pretty tough situations and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

2114
01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 3>that's just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2115
01:48:48.541 --> 01:48:53.541
<v Speaker 3>do you teach a course or is this a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this like a one time seminar type of </v>

2116
01:48:53.791 --> 01:48:55.050
<v Speaker 3>a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do both.</v>

2117
01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sometimes we go in,</v>

2118
01:48:57.390 --> 01:49:02.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll do like a keynote speech and </v>

2119
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.390
<v Speaker 3>those are good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are good.</v>

2120
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Those are great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2121
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:04.230
<v Speaker 3>we get a lot of positive feedback about </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2122
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:09.440
<v Speaker 3>but then sometimes we'll go in with </v>
<v Speaker 3>company and we've done like two year </v>

2123
01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.051
<v Speaker 3>contracts with companies where we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained everybody that they have and we </v>

2124
01:49:12.051 --> 01:49:13.140
<v Speaker 3>get all their leadership aligned on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same page and,</v>

2125
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:18.290
<v Speaker 3>and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll go in for maybe a couple of an </v>

2126
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.660
<v Speaker 3>assessment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll look and see what,</v>

2127
01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 3>learn about what business they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will learn about what they're doing,</v>

2128
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:26.391
<v Speaker 3>how they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what areas they can improve </v>

2129
01:49:26.391 --> 01:49:28.941
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll formulate a plan around that and </v>

2130
01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:28.941
<v Speaker 3>it will come back and we'll train </v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership.</v>

2131
01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:33.320
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to kind of construct a </v>

2132
01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:33.320
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2133
01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.160
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2134
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:36.240
<v Speaker 3>the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2135
01:49:36.241 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 3>the basic principles are always the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>

2136
01:49:37.651 --> 01:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>but some organizations have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems than other organizations.</v>

2137
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 3>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all have the same,</v>

2138
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:44.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2139
01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.050
<v Speaker 3>seven problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2140
01:49:46.051 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>whatever that number is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them were</v>

2141
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 2>really bad at this are really good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or they're failing here,</v>

2142
01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 2>but they're winning here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got to go in and check them out,</v>

2143
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>see what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what the issue is,</v>

2144
01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and then we get it turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this for warding for you d,</v>

2145
01:49:58.601 --> 01:50:00.610
<v Speaker 2>do you enjoy doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2146
01:50:00.611 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2147
01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2148
01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>

2149
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about combat all day long and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about.</v>

2150
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>And even more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about leadership all day long</v>

2151
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:10.220
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2152
01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:12.340
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most challenging thing.</v>

2153
01:50:12.341 --> 01:50:17.341
<v Speaker 2>The most challenging thing about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>in combat in a leadership position is </v>

2154
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:18.400
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.590
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what the enemy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do and trying to,</v>

2156
01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:25.890
<v Speaker 2>trying to organize a good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most challenging thing is dealing </v>

2157
01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:29.581
<v Speaker 2>with all these human beings that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the challenging thing is getting these </v>

2158
01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 2>guys and girls to do what they need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2159
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:36.250
<v Speaker 2>what you need them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get them to believe in it.</v>

2160
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:41.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what's challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we definitely learned lessons </v>

2161
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2162
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:47.910
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing about our book that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have gotten a lot of feedback is </v>

2163
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:48.070
<v Speaker 2>this book isn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2164
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:49.780
<v Speaker 2>look what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how awesome we are.</v>

2165
01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this book is.</v>

2166
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:52.660
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those chapters in that book </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2167
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we screwed up.</v>

2168
01:50:55.390 --> 01:51:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Here's the failure that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a horrible situation and it was</v>

2169
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:03.370
<v Speaker 2>my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we learn the lessons.</v>

2170
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what's made people </v>
<v Speaker 2>relate to it more because we're not just</v>

2171
01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:07.420
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2172
01:51:07.421 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 2>we're the greatest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2173
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:10.210
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2174
01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:12.220
<v Speaker 2>we were humbled by combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

2175
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:17.430
<v Speaker 2>we were humbled by the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were humbled by our own guys that did</v>

2176
01:51:18.401 --> 01:51:23.080
<v Speaker 2>amazing things when we were around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a little bit different</v>

2177
01:51:23.081 --> 01:51:23.590
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2178
01:51:23.591 --> 01:51:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes peep that appeals to the people is</v>

2179
01:51:28.031 --> 01:51:29.260
<v Speaker 2>they look at this and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2180
01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I can relate to that.</v>

2181
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've failed to.</v>

2182
01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2183
01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.300
<v Speaker 2>how did they handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2184
01:51:34.301 --> 01:51:35.380
<v Speaker 2>they did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2185
01:51:35.381 --> 01:51:38.100
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about combat,</v>

2186
01:51:38.130 --> 01:51:43.130
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about people organizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and staying together and figuring out </v>

2187
01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:46.801
<v Speaker 2>how to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about these extreme </v>

2188
01:51:46.801 --> 01:51:46.801
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most extreme ever.</v>

2189
01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:49.600
<v Speaker 2>And when you have these extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>

2190
01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:51.490
<v Speaker 2>obviously when there's a lot on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

2191
01:51:51.491 --> 01:51:56.491
<v Speaker 2>people are going to focus and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to fall apart and some </v>

2192
01:51:56.491 --> 01:51:56.680
<v Speaker 2>people are going to pull together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're gonna,</v>

2193
01:51:56.830 --> 01:52:01.830
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get people that understand the gravity </v>

2194
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:04.591
<v Speaker 2>of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would seem to me that it would be </v>

2195
01:52:04.591 --> 01:52:08.260
<v Speaker 2>much harder to impart that into people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the business world.</v>

2196
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Amplified and intensified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in combat lives are at stake.</v>

2197
01:52:13.211 --> 01:52:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In business world,</v>

2198
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.610
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had to fire anyone before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2199
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:23.930
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had people lose their job </v>

2200
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and couldn't pay their mortgage and feed</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids because you screwed up as a </v>

2201
01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:28.320
<v Speaker 2>boss?</v>

2202
01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:28.320
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pressure.</v>

2203
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:33.510
<v Speaker 2>That is mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever lost hundreds of millions </v>

2204
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:34.090
<v Speaker 2>of dollars worth of capital because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a bad decision?</v>

2205
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know why?</v>

2206
01:52:35.051 --> 01:52:36.320
<v Speaker 2>It's because I'm not a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2207
01:52:36.321 --> 01:52:39.120
<v Speaker 2>so there's good things and not being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader is the,</v>

2208
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:41.990
<v Speaker 2>the benefits of non-leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2209
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:43.130
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2210
01:52:43.131 --> 01:52:44.560
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people asked me that question is to</v>

2211
01:52:44.561 --> 01:52:45.860
<v Speaker 2>ask that question all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2212
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about,</v>

2213
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not about lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about livelihoods,</v>

2214
01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got people that are relying on </v>

2215
01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.651
<v Speaker 2>you to succeed and win and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you get killed in combat.</v>

2216
01:52:56.690 --> 01:52:58.880
<v Speaker 2>That's obviously the worst thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can happen,</v>

2217
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:01.890
<v Speaker 2>but if you lose your job or you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2218
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:06.940
<v Speaker 2>your people lose their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people killed themselves all the </v>

2219
01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:06.940
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they make bad business decisions,</v>

2220
01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 2>it's that much pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that much pressure for sure.</v>

2221
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why it does translate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because business people relate to that </v>

2222
01:53:14.530 --> 01:53:16.030
<v Speaker 2>amount of pressure and they understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how it feels to,</v>

2223
01:53:16.050 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 2>to have that bearing down on them.</v>

2224
01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.780
<v Speaker 2>It just seems to me for a guy like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe you will be even more </v>

2225
01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:27.191
<v Speaker 2>attracted to going into business then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be to teaching people how to </v>

2226
01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:30.080
<v Speaker 2>lead their businesses better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:53:30.081 --> 01:53:35.081
<v Speaker 2>And I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a business where you a business </v>

2228
01:53:35.081 --> 01:53:36.040
<v Speaker 2>and it is definitely what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2229
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 2>and that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to now go into business,</v>

2230
01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to learn some new business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2231
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 2>why not just take the skills that I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2232
01:53:42.951 --> 01:53:44.000
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2233
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 2>we know about leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just help other people.</v>

2234
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:52.390
<v Speaker 2>And that is rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rewarding to talk to someone </v>

2235
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:55.540
<v Speaker 2>and have them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did what you told me to do and this is</v>

2236
01:53:55.731 --> 01:54:00.731
<v Speaker 2>the result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the outcome that's very </v>

2237
01:54:00.731 --> 01:54:00.731
<v Speaker 2>rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2238
01:54:00.731 --> 01:54:01.180
<v Speaker 2>and another piece of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2239
01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:04.010
<v Speaker 2>everything always ties to me back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2240
01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:06.420
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2241
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 2>the businesses in this country are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic power of this nation.</v>

2242
01:54:10.971 --> 01:54:15.020
<v Speaker 2>And our economic power is the backbone </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our authority in the world.</v>

2243
01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.450
<v Speaker 2>And so to help businesses grow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve is,</v>

2244
01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:19.650
<v Speaker 2>is very rewarding because I know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2245
01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a very patriotic thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Capitalism is,</v>

2246
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very patriotic piece of America.</v>

2247
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting way to look at the</v>

2248
01:54:27.741 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 2>big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I agree with you.</v>

2249
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say something that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate me saying,</v>

2250
01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna say it because I need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it to you.</v>

2251
01:54:34.371 --> 01:54:39.371
<v Speaker 2>You should have a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People always get mad at me because I </v>

2252
01:54:39.371 --> 01:54:39.371
<v Speaker 2>say this all the time to interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests,</v>

2253
01:54:39.371 --> 01:54:44.261
<v Speaker 2>but this is not something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to do and you'd be fucking </v>

2254
01:54:44.261 --> 01:54:46.040
<v Speaker 2>great at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that your perspective on the</v>

2255
01:54:46.041 --> 01:54:49.340
<v Speaker 2>military and your perspective on our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

2256
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.090
<v Speaker 2>our situation overseas I think would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very unusual,</v>

2257
01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.760
<v Speaker 2>very unusual and very educated.</v>

2258
01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.350
<v Speaker 2>And I just think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one out there that's doing it</v>

2259
01:54:59.351 --> 01:55:00.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could do it.</v>

2260
01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Well we definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2261
01:55:02.361 --> 01:55:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

2262
01:55:03.261 --> 01:55:04.670
<v Speaker 2>The first person said that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

2263
01:55:04.671 --> 01:55:07.760
<v Speaker 2>when Tim Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we got done with the podcast and he</v>

2264
01:55:07.761 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 2>pressed stop on the thing and he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked up at me and said,</v>

2265
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:13.890
<v Speaker 2>you need to do your own podcast for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to.</v>

2266
01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to some of my,</v>

2267
01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.590
<v Speaker 2>some of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my buddies about it.</v>

2268
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:20.670
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2269
01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.790
<v Speaker 2>we're working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do man.</v>

2270
01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Get a fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2271
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2272
01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Press record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2273
01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 2>sit down with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard to do.</v>

2274
01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

2275
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2276
01:55:29.871 --> 01:55:30.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting too,</v>

2277
01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:32.860
<v Speaker 2>and I'm getting over the fact of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2278
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.200
<v Speaker 2>like I told you earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2279
01:55:34.201 --> 01:55:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said on the Tim Ferriss program,</v>

2280
01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that just talk for no reason and </v>

2281
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for me to get used to like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that somebody wants to hear</v>

2282
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.760
<v Speaker 3>what I have to say that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2283
01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:49.380
<v Speaker 3>a seal or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a direct businessperson.</v>

2284
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:50.130
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2285
01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2286
01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably end up doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

2287
01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

2288
01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.470
<v Speaker 1>great military leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Zau,</v>

2289
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.370
<v Speaker 1>it's sung sue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of war,</v>

2290
01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:06.371
<v Speaker 1>whether it's me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a motive Musashi from the book of five </v>

2291
01:56:06.371 --> 01:56:08.651
<v Speaker 1>rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Warriors from the past have </v>

2292
01:56:08.651 --> 01:56:12.280
<v Speaker 1>written books that civilians have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot out of and I think that someone </v>

2293
01:56:13.581 --> 01:56:16.730
<v Speaker 1>like you instead of writing a book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your book,</v>

2294
01:56:16.731 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's great and I'm sure there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of lessons in that,</v>

2295
01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:23.300
<v Speaker 1>but on a daily basis to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

2296
01:56:23.301 --> 01:56:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fire up your podcast anytime.</v>

2297
01:56:26.661 --> 01:56:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Something like Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Paris attack happens.</v>

2298
01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:34.660
<v Speaker 1>You could give your perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously uploaded onto the </v>

2299
01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Internet and it's just never been a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2300
01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful that we could sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and read what [inaudible] Musashi wrote </v>

2301
01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.000
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2302
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:43.970
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2303
01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:48.971
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting you should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to peer into the mind of one of </v>

2304
01:56:48.971 --> 01:56:51.650
<v Speaker 1>the greatest swordsman that ever lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see his philosophies on life,</v>

2305
01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:57.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think that today with the advent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet and with the ability to </v>

2306
01:56:59.601 --> 01:57:02.570
<v Speaker 1>broadcast yourself virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously,</v>

2307
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I think you could.</v>

2308
01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:09.280
<v Speaker 1>You could make a gigantic impact in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing that perspective and taking </v>

2309
01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:15.941
<v Speaker 1>those experiences that you have so </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserved and so earned and,</v>

2310
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and giving people this insight that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

2311
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.510
<v Speaker 1>they're just not going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2312
01:57:20.511 --> 01:57:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

2313
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:27.490
<v Speaker 1>I got it from you from that Tim Ferriss </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode and I'm getting it even more </v>

2314
01:57:27.490 --> 01:57:28.340
<v Speaker 1>from you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perspective.</v>

2315
01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:31.040
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to get from </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who wasn't there.</v>

2316
01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:33.890
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get these fuzzy,</v>

2317
01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:39.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's like two people sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard two people talk about </v>

2318
01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:39.980
<v Speaker 1>martial arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know shit about martial arts,</v>

2319
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's like to hear someone </v>

2320
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:45.310
<v Speaker 1>like me talk about the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2321
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2322
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:47.060
<v Speaker 3>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's another thing that,</v>

2323
01:57:47.150 --> 01:57:48.400
<v Speaker 3>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

2324
01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:55.740
<v Speaker 3>sorting out in my own head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this idea of broadcasting </v>

2325
01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.170
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2326
01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:59.110
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird.</v>

2327
01:57:59.111 --> 01:57:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you grew up,</v>

2328
01:58:00.010 --> 01:58:01.300
<v Speaker 3>you were into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:58:01.301 --> 01:58:06.301
<v Speaker 3>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been a comedian for your pretty </v>

2330
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:07.690
<v Speaker 3>much your whole adult life for 26 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 26 years you were getting on stage.</v>

2331
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:10.870
<v Speaker 3>That's what you wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And honestly,</v>

2332
01:58:10.871 --> 01:58:15.790
<v Speaker 3>when I first joined the seal teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the most frowned upon thing was</v>

2333
01:58:15.791 --> 01:58:18.010
<v Speaker 3>to be broadcasting yourself that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were a seal,</v>

2334
01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.610
<v Speaker 3>that you were at what you did and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it took me a long time.</v>

2335
01:58:21.611 --> 01:58:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2336
01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Writing this book was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>

2337
01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really hard thing to do because </v>

2338
01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 3>you sit there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2339
01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2340
01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.520
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to be humble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2341
01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.780
<v Speaker 3>You're a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be humble.</v>

2342
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to write a big book about</v>

2343
01:58:34.611 --> 01:58:35.780
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just did,</v>

2344
01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:38.610
<v Speaker 3>that just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was really hard and,</v>

2345
01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.640
<v Speaker 3>and Lafe and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the biggest things that </v>

2346
01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:45.070
<v Speaker 3>we did as we edited it and edited it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>edited it.</v>

2347
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:50.460
<v Speaker 3>We went through it just to just to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that we were coming across and </v>

2348
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.961
<v Speaker 3>saying things in a manner that really </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflected that humility,</v>

2349
01:58:56.381 --> 01:59:01.381
<v Speaker 3>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to do because it's a </v>

2350
01:59:01.381 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dichotomy because you're saying,</v>

2351
01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:03.970
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be humble as a leader,</v>

2352
01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.190
<v Speaker 3>but I'm gonna read a big book about </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

2353
01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy.</v>

2354
01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're sitting here like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2355
01:59:09.971 --> 01:59:11.290
<v Speaker 3>you should have a podcast and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

2356
01:59:12.370 --> 01:59:14.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should broadcast yourself.</v>

2357
01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:19.800
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the way I was raised because you </v>

2358
01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:22.831
<v Speaker 3>spent your whole adult life in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent my whole adult life in the seal </v>

2359
01:59:22.831 --> 01:59:25.951
<v Speaker 3>teams and I was raised by these old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam guys that were bad asses and </v>

2360
01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:27.880
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2361
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:29.240
<v Speaker 3>you don't talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2362
01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:32.900
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm kind of going against this </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I was raised and,</v>

2363
01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 3>and so again I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting over it,</v>

2364
01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:38.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get over it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time I don't want to get</v>

2365
01:59:38.741 --> 01:59:40.660
<v Speaker 3>completely over it because that's part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2366
01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:46.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the way I was raised and </v>

2367
01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:46.110
<v Speaker 3>what I believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even</v>

2368
01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I see their point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2369
01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand why they would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't talk about it,</v>

2370
01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:53.720
<v Speaker 1>but what I think the benefit of talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it today as opposed to their time </v>

2371
01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.990
<v Speaker 1>is through the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can broadcast in a way that would be</v>

2372
01:59:57.991 --> 01:59:58.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2373
01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:04.040
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to take a navy seal back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day and give them a gigantic </v>

2374
02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>television show where they could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they wanted,</v>

2375
02:00:06.690 --> 02:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>broadcast anytime they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a successful podcast,</v>

2376
02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>you can reach hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with each episode,</v>

2377
02:00:13.261 --> 02:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>which is just like a successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>television show.</v>

2378
02:00:15.930 --> 02:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to educate people </v>

2379
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:24.921
<v Speaker 1>and give people this perspective that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that I got from you that are just </v>

2380
02:00:24.921 --> 02:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>not getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting from anybody else unless</v>

2381
02:00:26.221 --> 02:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>they've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get it from you.</v>

2382
02:00:28.050 --> 02:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I get it from Tim Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it from Brian Stann.</v>

2383
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I get it from Andy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

2384
02:00:31.861 --> 02:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I get it from people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you.</v>

2385
02:00:33.691 --> 02:00:38.691
<v Speaker 1>You get a different perspective than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to get from someone </v>

2386
02:00:38.691 --> 02:00:43.011
<v Speaker 1>who's just pontificating or guessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>waxing poetically on the nature of man </v>

2387
02:00:43.011 --> 02:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>and war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit.</v>

2388
02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Until you talk to someone who's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>been there,</v>

2389
02:00:46.770 --> 02:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't really understand what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2390
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>

2391
02:00:52.921 --> 02:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I really think you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really.</v>

2392
02:00:54.301 --> 02:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I really think it would help a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2393
02:00:56.370 --> 02:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it would help a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand from the perspective of </v>

2394
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:05.091
<v Speaker 1>someone who actually knows what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and there's not a lot of </v>

2395
02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>that in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is also what you're talking</v>

2396
02:01:06.961 --> 02:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>about when you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership in this country.</v>

2397
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2398
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you should be someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has served in the military in order </v>

2399
02:01:16.570 --> 02:01:21.141
<v Speaker 1>to qualify for being the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a bad idea to </v>

2400
02:01:21.141 --> 02:01:25.401
<v Speaker 1>throw it out there to to say that at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very least you should spend some time </v>

2401
02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>living in these environments where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in massive conflict.</v>

2402
02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>At the very least you should visit them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of time with the people who </v>

2403
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>have lived and served and fought in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries.</v>

2404
02:01:38.911 --> 02:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>So you understand</v>

2405
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:45.920
<v Speaker 2>clearly with no fuzziness at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on in the world?</v>

2406
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt that I think military </v>

2407
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

2408
02:01:54.090 --> 02:01:58.200
<v Speaker 2>it was so good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so good for me.</v>

2409
02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:01.170
<v Speaker 2>And would it be good for everybody would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been about Jamie over there?</v>

2410
02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>

2411
02:02:03.450 --> 02:02:04.440
<v Speaker 2>So you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2412
02:02:04.441 --> 02:02:09.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100 percent sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee Jamie would get it all out </v>

2413
02:02:09.441 --> 02:02:10.620
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he wouldn't get it.</v>

2414
02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he might wind up like that dude and </v>

2415
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:15.650
<v Speaker 2>full metal jacket with a rifle in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom.</v>

2416
02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Private Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet.</v>

2417
02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:21.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2418
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:25.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2419
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

2420
02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the military,</v>

2421
02:02:27.721 --> 02:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>did the military was great for me and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2422
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2423
02:02:30.721 --> 02:02:35.721
<v Speaker 2>you were born for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like something you were </v>

2424
02:02:35.721 --> 02:02:36.000
<v Speaker 2>drawn to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a magnet to metal filings.</v>

2425
02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2426
02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drawn to it,</v>

2427
02:02:38.221 --> 02:02:38.550
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2428
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I was still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I joined my dad,</v>

2429
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>my dad said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2430
02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hate it because you hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>

2431
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:49.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what my dad said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2432
02:02:49.690 --> 02:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2433
02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2434
02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that gives you an indication as to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of kid I was.</v>

2435
02:02:54.961 --> 02:02:59.961
<v Speaker 2>I was completely out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't listen to anybody and I was </v>

2436
02:02:59.961 --> 02:03:01.050
<v Speaker 2>probably similar to what you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing,</v>

2437
02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2438
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I was just now to control kid that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>did whatever.</v>

2439
02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:09.540
<v Speaker 2>And so joining the military it put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the structure around me and all of a</v>

2440
02:03:09.541 --> 02:03:11.490
<v Speaker 2>sudden I could take all this energy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>

2441
02:03:11.610 --> 02:03:16.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's really nice about is you get </v>

2442
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:16.610
<v Speaker 2>this clean slate where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2443
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:16.610
<v Speaker 2>if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be successful.</v>

2444
02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Check these boxes and I was like,</v>

2445
02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:19.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to do those things,</v>

2446
02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>and you just do them and you develop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

2447
02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.220
<v Speaker 2>The discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talk about that all the time.</v>

2448
02:03:26.221 --> 02:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2449
02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:31.680
<v Speaker 2>the fact that discipline equals freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the more discipline you have as a </v>

2450
02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:32.070
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more freedom you're going to have,</v>

2451
02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:34.140
<v Speaker 2>which is completely counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2452
02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:35.220
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2453
02:03:35.221 --> 02:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you're living this discipline lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means you,</v>

2454
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.030
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any freedom.</v>

2455
02:03:39.210 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have freedom because I have </v>

2456
02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2457
02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2458
02:03:45.150 --> 02:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>financial freedom because I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial discipline,</v>

2459
02:03:47.850 --> 02:03:52.850
<v Speaker 2>I have more time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have more time because I have the </v>

2460
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:54.570
<v Speaker 2>discipline to get up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>before most normal people get up.</v>

2461
02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Those are the kinds of disciplines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you put in place.</v>

2462
02:03:56.581 --> 02:03:58.380
<v Speaker 2>And those definitely get instilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the military.</v>

2463
02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the one thing that disciplined </v>

2464
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:05.931
<v Speaker 2>definitely does help you with is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps you get things done and when you </v>

2465
02:04:06.541 --> 02:04:08.030
<v Speaker 2>get things done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2466
02:04:08.230 --> 02:04:10.330
<v Speaker 2>you actually do things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2467
02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2468
02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you have more success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have more success and sometimes a</v>

2469
02:04:14.850 --> 02:04:18.210
<v Speaker 2>big part of success is just not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lazy and just doing it,</v>

2470
02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>just get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like 90 percent of it is just </v>

2471
02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.461
<v Speaker 2>showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get there and start working like you're </v>

2472
02:04:25.461 --> 02:04:26.160
<v Speaker 2>not going to feel perfect every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I felt,</v>

2473
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:31.210
<v Speaker 2>if I only worked out when I felt good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a fat fuck because there's a lot </v>

2474
02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:35.481
<v Speaker 2>of days I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been pretty much the same with </v>

2475
02:04:35.481 --> 02:04:38.150
<v Speaker 2>everybody that that actually gets good </v>
<v Speaker 2>at something that you get.</v>

2476
02:04:38.150 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be those days you pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and they're probably going to be</v>

2477
02:04:41.851 --> 02:04:46.851
<v Speaker 1>more numerous than the days you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the benefit of discipline in my </v>

2478
02:04:46.851 --> 02:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>eyes has always been that through </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline I get things done.</v>

2479
02:04:50.130 --> 02:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say that I'm like the most lazy</v>

2480
02:04:54.331 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>disciplined person I know because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do it,</v>

2481
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>but I always do.</v>

2482
02:04:59.030 --> 02:05:01.160
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be interesting to get your </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on this,</v>

2483
02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:06.220
<v Speaker 3>this statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I also think that discipline is,</v>

2484
02:05:08.150 --> 02:05:13.150
<v Speaker 3>is a pathway to creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you when I talk about </v>

2485
02:05:13.150 --> 02:05:16.721
<v Speaker 3>creativity is another misconception </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the military when you're on the </v>

2486
02:05:16.721 --> 02:05:19.811
<v Speaker 3>battlefield is an absolute exercise in </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity.</v>

2487
02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already talked about how you're going </v>

2488
02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>to lead these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

2489
02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:26.360
<v Speaker 3>How you're going to influence them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you going to talk to them?</v>

2490
02:05:26.361 --> 02:05:27.920
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to say the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>

2491
02:05:27.921 --> 02:05:30.800
<v Speaker 3>That's creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you throw on top of that,</v>

2492
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:31.880
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The enemy,</v>

2493
02:05:32.210 --> 02:05:35.840
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to attack them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to disorganize them?</v>

2494
02:05:35.841 --> 02:05:40.841
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to get in their heads?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all just massive creativity.</v>

2495
02:05:41.090 --> 02:05:43.550
<v Speaker 3>And when I look at people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists like yourself,</v>

2496
02:05:43.551 --> 02:05:46.270
<v Speaker 3>because you're a standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

2497
02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplined you are the,</v>

2498
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:51.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get up and write,</v>

2499
02:05:51.591 --> 02:05:56.591
<v Speaker 3>you gotta write stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to read and find out about </v>

2500
02:05:56.591 --> 02:06:00.131
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the world so you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>more things that you can jab baton and </v>

2501
02:06:00.131 --> 02:06:01.610
<v Speaker 3>make fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to increase your vocabulary.</v>

2502
02:06:01.611 --> 02:06:06.611
<v Speaker 3>So that you are quicker and sharper so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when people are saying things that </v>

2503
02:06:06.611 --> 02:06:06.620
<v Speaker 3>you have more words to battle back at </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2504
02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:10.010
<v Speaker 3>all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that freedom that you get on stage,</v>

2505
02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:13.490
<v Speaker 3>it comes from the discipline that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>

2506
02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:14.990
<v Speaker 3>You learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read,</v>

2507
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:16.430
<v Speaker 3>you write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk,</v>

2508
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you go through things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that an accurate state?</v>

2509
02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great book on it.</v>

2510
02:06:21.410 --> 02:06:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pressfield wrote a book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war of art and press field was </v>

2511
02:06:26.410 --> 02:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>essentially like a ne'er do well until </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 40 years old.</v>

2512
02:06:28.941 --> 02:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of a fuck up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured it out.</v>

2513
02:06:31.761 --> 02:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere along the line I figured it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2514
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I used to keep a stack of them in my old</v>
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>

2515
02:06:35.361 --> 02:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>not hand them out to guests if I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed it.</v>

2516
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Take this because trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read this,</v>

2517
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of artists in comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet musicians as well,</v>

2518
02:06:44.181 --> 02:06:49.181
<v Speaker 1>but writers for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big problems is sitting down </v>

2519
02:06:49.181 --> 02:06:53.471
<v Speaker 1>and doing the work and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta and Pressfield talks about </v>

2520
02:06:53.471 --> 02:06:57.731
<v Speaker 1>that in the most concise and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and he labels it like an enemy.</v>

2521
02:06:58.971 --> 02:07:00.880
<v Speaker 1>He calls it resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and that you have to sit down and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to overcome resistance and that the</v>

2523
02:07:03.711 --> 02:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>pro goes to work and he doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're sick.</v>

2524
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you,</v>

2525
02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you're a pro and you go to work and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just it puts it in your head that this </v>

2526
02:07:15.231 --> 02:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>is what I do and this is what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have pride in that.</v>

2527
02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And then when you are in front of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keyboard and you look down the count,</v>

2528
02:07:22.911 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 1>it says I fucking thousand words today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a thousand more than you,</v>

2529
02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2530
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the work and out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

2531
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>gems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blossom,</v>

2532
02:07:31.330 --> 02:07:36.330
<v Speaker 1>little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you might have a day where you just </v>

2533
02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:38.321
<v Speaker 1>write nothing but dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So show up again tomorrow and tomorrow </v>

2534
02:07:38.321 --> 02:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>out of that dark shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flower emerge you never know.</v>

2535
02:07:40.061 --> 02:07:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real,</v>

2536
02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 1>like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really develop your potential.</v>

2537
02:07:45.371 --> 02:07:50.371
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's as an author or even as a </v>

2538
02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:50.371
<v Speaker 1>martial artist.</v>

2539
02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of creativity in martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts to be a great striker.</v>

2540
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to be creative because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2541
02:07:56.800 --> 02:08:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You have to develop patterns or execute </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are aren't going to be </v>

2542
02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>perceived like if a guy has a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple one,</v>

2543
02:08:04.991 --> 02:08:05.520
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2544
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:10.530
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to time that shit and you </v>

2545
02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>were talking before the podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holmes victory over Rhonda Rousey </v>

2546
02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about was that Rhonda had this </v>

2547
02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:19.060
<v Speaker 1>very linear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward attack.</v>

2548
02:08:19.061 --> 02:08:24.010
<v Speaker 1>You knew she was coming and holly is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master at at countering,</v>

2549
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:29.130
<v Speaker 1>so all she had to do was wait and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rhonda was coming in one direction.</v>

2550
02:08:29.590 --> 02:08:31.030
<v Speaker 1>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

2551
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.180
<v Speaker 1>There was no variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no creativity.</v>

2552
02:08:34.181 --> 02:08:39.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a mad bull dog rush that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on everybody else before,</v>

2553
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:44.370
<v Speaker 1>but she found one person who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuoso at movement and she needed </v>

2554
02:08:45.131 --> 02:08:48.490
<v Speaker 1>creativity and it wasn't there and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed that experience.</v>

2555
02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:53.610
<v Speaker 1>That came with having faced someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew that position and new new had a </v>

2556
02:08:53.831 --> 02:08:58.831
<v Speaker 1>deep understanding of that movement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have that in their </v>

2557
02:08:58.831 --> 02:08:59.410
<v Speaker 1>repertoire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the result that we saw.</v>

2558
02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Like a striker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson Silva,</v>

2559
02:09:01.571 --> 02:09:04.030
<v Speaker 1>he's extremely creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch,</v>

2560
02:09:04.031 --> 02:09:08.770
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fight versus Tony Frequent in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage warriors,</v>

2561
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:10.510
<v Speaker 1>cage warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was it called?</v>

2562
02:09:10.511 --> 02:09:15.511
<v Speaker 1>In England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small organization in England where he </v>

2563
02:09:15.671 --> 02:09:20.671
<v Speaker 1>practiced this step in upper cut elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sideways elbow and his coach was </v>

2564
02:09:21.941 --> 02:09:23.230
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking crazy.</v>

2565
02:09:23.231 --> 02:09:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Stop practicing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would make his wife hold a pillow</v>

2566
02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>because it's his coach didn't want him </v>
<v Speaker 1>to practice anymore because he thought </v>

2567
02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>he was wasting his time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he practiced stepping.</v>

2568
02:09:32.981 --> 02:09:37.981
<v Speaker 1>His wife would hold a pillow for him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd step in and throw this uppercut </v>

2569
02:09:37.981 --> 02:09:38.860
<v Speaker 1>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when he knocked out Franklin with</v>

2570
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:42.370
<v Speaker 1>and obviously the Franklin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>outclassed in that fight,</v>

2571
02:09:42.610 --> 02:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to make a point and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front kick that he landed the face </v>

2572
02:09:47.610 --> 02:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>of Vito Belfort.</v>

2573
02:09:47.610 --> 02:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Vito,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that check coming because </v>

2574
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:54.121
<v Speaker 1>nobody had done that to him before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody had done that in the </v>

2575
02:09:54.121 --> 02:09:54.250
<v Speaker 1>history of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had ever knocked anybody out.</v>

2576
02:09:54.251 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>With the first kick you learn in martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

2577
02:09:57.310 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but the creativity to try something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2578
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>he would throw punches to your thigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>from standing.</v>

2579
02:10:03.791 --> 02:10:06.760
<v Speaker 1>He would throw a jab to your thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would throw a crescent kick,</v>

2580
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.200
<v Speaker 1>an inside crescent kick to your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck it was.</v>

2581
02:10:10.230 --> 02:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It was part of what made him such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective stryker is that he through </v>

2582
02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:17.260
<v Speaker 1>these things that you just didn't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to do.</v>

2583
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:20.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of creativity in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that?</v>

2584
02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2585
02:10:20.710 --> 02:10:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2586
02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Dean lister and Jeff Glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my guys.</v>

2587
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Glover is one of the most creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in Jujitsu today.</v>

2588
02:10:27.821 --> 02:10:32.821
<v Speaker 1>He's one of my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does this thing for folks who don't </v>

2589
02:10:32.821 --> 02:10:32.821
<v Speaker 1>understand Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what we're talking about.</v>

2590
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>He does this thing called</v>

2591
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.710
<v Speaker 2>a donkey guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking crazy.</v>

2592
02:10:36.711 --> 02:10:39.140
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets on literally,</v>

2593
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:44.200
<v Speaker 2>he faces you with his butt to you and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>launches himself backwards like a donkey</v>

2594
02:10:45.291 --> 02:10:50.291
<v Speaker 2>kicking and wraps you up and it looks so</v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous while he's doing it that so</v>

2595
02:10:50.451 --> 02:10:55.451
<v Speaker 2>many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when he first started </v>

2596
02:10:55.451 --> 02:10:57.521
<v Speaker 2>executing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just had no idea what the fuck to do </v>

2597
02:10:57.521 --> 02:10:57.521
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is right there.</v>

2598
02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Got Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

2599
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.420
<v Speaker 2>he's out of his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He so uh,</v>

2600
02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:05.860
<v Speaker 2>he so comfortable in every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2601
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he trains everyday.</v>

2602
02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:12.140
<v Speaker 2>We're the same gym and he trains </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday with whoever and he puts </v>

2603
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:15.470
<v Speaker 2>himself in the most ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible positions.</v>

2604
02:11:15.471 --> 02:11:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2605
02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:18.860
<v Speaker 2>he'll let people get a rear naked choke </v>
<v Speaker 2>on him.</v>

2606
02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he all watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what in God's name,</v>

2607
02:11:21.531 --> 02:11:23.360
<v Speaker 2>how was he going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he will escape.</v>

2608
02:11:23.730 --> 02:11:26.430
<v Speaker 2>He just put himself in horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions all the time just to organize,</v>

2609
02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:29.750
<v Speaker 2>just to work on his defense and just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in a bad way.</v>

2610
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:32.540

2641
02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is he doing?</v>

2643
02:12:49.630 --> 02:12:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he just eats a lot,</v>

2644
02:12:50.650 --> 02:12:54.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely lifting too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like food doesn't go right to your neck,</v>

2645
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:56.840
<v Speaker 2>his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a genetic,</v>

2646
02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:01.980
<v Speaker 2>a genetic mutant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another using genetic mutant and yeah,</v>

2648
02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:09.540
<v Speaker 2>are mutants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their actual grappling mutants where if </v>

2649
02:13:09.771 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 2>you and I were to like concoct some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

2650
02:13:12.051 --> 02:13:15.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like potion and create beings,</v>

2651
02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd make like a Jeff Glover because </v>

2652
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>he's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flexible,</v>

2653
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:23.720
<v Speaker 2>wirey and you'd be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd make a dean lister who's </v>

2654
02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:24.290
<v Speaker 2>just a big mutant.</v>

2656
02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 2>everything perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's,</v>

2657
02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:31.710
<v Speaker 2>his defense is really good and he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>

2658
02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:32.110
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2659
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:33.870
<v Speaker 3>really hard to tap him with stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2660
02:13:33.871 --> 02:13:35.520
<v Speaker 3>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he'll just give people,</v>

2661
02:13:35.610 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his foot and be like,</v>

2662
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

2663
02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:44.060
<v Speaker 3>And it takes me like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to soften his foot up with </v>

2664
02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:45.600
<v Speaker 3>like nine foot locks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then just crank it,</v>

2665
02:13:45.601 --> 02:13:46.920
<v Speaker 3>granted grandkids and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2666
02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>on the third day I'll get a deep one and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll already be like hurt.</v>

2667
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:51.420
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2668
02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to soften them up overseas.</v>

2669
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Tenderizing meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that was why it was so shocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Josh Barnett tapped him because </v>

2671
02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Josh Barnett tapped him and like old </v>
<v Speaker 1>school side like headlock joke,</v>

2672
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:10.760
<v Speaker 1>which is a very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that you see like a high </v>

2673
02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:14.130
<v Speaker 1>level guy that executes that choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way Josh did.</v>

2674
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Josh has got that old school catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling knowledge too,</v>

2675
02:14:17.431 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 1>which is just such a different approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get used to a certain approaches</v>

2676
02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:25.700
<v Speaker 1>and Josh has a very different approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a very physically strong guys.</v>

2677
02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean Dean is just a dean is a </v>

2678
02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:35.200
<v Speaker 3>mutant and he is a gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly gifted grappler.</v>

2679
02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:36.910
<v Speaker 3>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2680
02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 3>his training methodology and lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not really conducive to a competing </v>

2681
02:14:44.531 --> 02:14:45.610
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2682
02:14:46.570 --> 02:14:49.300
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a nice way of saying he's kind of</v>

2683
02:14:49.301 --> 02:14:53.510
<v Speaker 3>lazy.</v>

02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:35.680
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2726
02:16:35.681 --> 02:16:36.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is a mutant.</v>

2727
02:16:36.690 --> 02:16:39.030
<v Speaker 3>He is a mutant that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
02:16:39.031 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 3>if I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2729
02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.820
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he in adcc his last,</v>

2730
02:16:42.821 --> 02:16:47.821
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his match against Buccella when we </v>

2731
02:16:47.821 --> 02:16:48.880
<v Speaker 3>churches just a complete beast and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2732
02:16:48.881 --> 02:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>they went at it and that was a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>close match.</v>

2733
02:16:51.341 --> 02:16:56.341
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch training videos of </v>

2734
02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:59.560
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] getting ready for ADCC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's training like a complete savage.</v>

2735
02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's bringing wrestlers in,</v>

2736
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:03.250
<v Speaker 3>he's clean and jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's flipping tires,</v>

2737
02:17:03.251 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 3>he's doing everything that one does to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for a situation like that.</v>

2738
02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.600
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dean does not do those types of </v>

2739
02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:12.600
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2740
02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:12.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll come in and train a little bit and</v>

2741
02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:16.270
<v Speaker 3>go on his natural ability as a mutant </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being to get it done.</v>

2742
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:22.110
<v Speaker 3>It's always frustrating when you see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who is so naturally gifted who kind </v>

2743
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.840
<v Speaker 3>of like lays back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

2744
02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:28.080
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of what happens is the </v>

2745
02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.471
<v Speaker 3>people that are naturally gifted don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to work as hard so they don't work </v>

2746
02:17:31.471 --> 02:17:32.650
<v Speaker 3>as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also part of,</v>

2747
02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talk about Jeff and dean,</v>

2748
02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 3>both those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both and you know,</v>

2749
02:17:38.081 --> 02:17:43.081
<v Speaker 3>you could throw Eddie and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw all kinds of people into this </v>

2750
02:17:43.081 --> 02:17:43.090
<v Speaker 3>category who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>

2751
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of game changers.</v>

2752
02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:46.930
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2753

2754
02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:55.261
<v Speaker 3>out a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely know Jeff and dean and </v>

<v Speaker 3>some weird stuff about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2757
02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:04.471
<v Speaker 3>I mean they got some weird personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and from my perspective that is,</v>

2758
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:11.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if you didn't have that weird </v>

<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to do it.</v>

2772
02:18:30.670 --> 02:18:31.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll train it.</v>

2773
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I'll train for an hour and half night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were like,</v>

2774
02:18:33.371 --> 02:18:33.670
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to live in,</v>

2776
02:18:36.221 --> 02:18:38.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the mat and dean,</v>

2777
02:18:38.201 --> 02:18:43.201
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he didn't have that weird like </v>

2778
02:18:43.201 --> 02:18:44.740
<v Speaker 3>spark that made him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes him.</v>

2779
02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got some weird like knowledge.</v>

2780
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:52.990
<v Speaker 3>What's weird about him is if you ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo about,</v>

2781
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rubber guard,</v>

2782
02:18:54.191 --> 02:18:58.370
<v Speaker 3>he knows all this details about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you ask them about a full lock or</v>

2783
02:18:58.371 --> 02:19:03.371
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that he doesn't know that </v>

2784
02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:03.371
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>

2785
02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:03.371
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

2786
02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:04.150
<v Speaker 3>You'll ask Dean about something that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows nothing like you've never seen him</v>

2787
02:19:04.151 --> 02:19:06.460
<v Speaker 3>do before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'll know all these detailed of the</v>

2788
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:11.461
<v Speaker 3>moves and I don't know if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seriously don't know if he goes and </v>

2789
02:19:11.461 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 3>watches it on youtube or if he like </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies or write it down,</v>

2790
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:15.430
<v Speaker 3>but he's got this weird little almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain man.</v>

2791
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2792
02:19:17.231 --> 02:19:20.320
<v Speaker 3>idiot savant type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird thing in his head.</v>

2793
02:19:20.710 --> 02:19:24.490
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those guys that had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard time transitioning into mma.</v>

2794
02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His striking just never seemed</v>

2795
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.680
<v Speaker 2>fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2796
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he worked hard at it.</v>

2797
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:37.270
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever his body is designed for </v>

2798
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.270
<v Speaker 2>trap things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2799
02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And you see that with everybody because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got strengths and weaknesses </v>

2800
02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:43.670
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's going to be good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and bad at something else.</v>

2801
02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
02:19:44.841 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you and I know all of these examples of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are like this.</v>

2803
02:19:47.271 --> 02:19:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Every fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2804
02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:52.980
<v Speaker 2>he's got some weak area and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally get a guy that liked gsp </v>

2805
02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 2>that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well rounded.</v>

2806
02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2807
02:19:55.401 --> 02:19:57.020
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even things,</v>

2808
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:59.000
<v Speaker 2>physical things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical attributes,</v>

2809
02:19:59.001 --> 02:20:01.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are just super mutant strong</v>

2810
02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:06.970
<v Speaker 2>and some people are just super crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexible and some people have </v>

2811
02:20:06.970 --> 02:20:08.840
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable natural cardio and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't.</v>

2812
02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's some people that are really</v>

2813
02:20:12.921 --> 02:20:17.921
<v Speaker 2>good at grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some people are really good at </v>

2814
02:20:17.921 --> 02:20:17.921
<v Speaker 2>striking.</v>

2815
02:20:17.921 --> 02:20:18.020
<v Speaker 2>There are some people that are good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting all those things together,</v>

2816
02:20:18.021 --> 02:20:23.021
<v Speaker 2>which I always thought fader was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural at combining his striking with </v>

2817
02:20:23.021 --> 02:20:27.041
<v Speaker 2>his grappling and kind of making it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fit together better than most people </v>

2818
02:20:27.041 --> 02:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2819
02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:28.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you on that.</v>

2820
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:33.761
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really stood out about him was that he </v>

2821
02:20:33.761 --> 02:20:37.061
<v Speaker 2>didn't fall into that trap that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do where if you're a really good </v>

2822
02:20:37.191 --> 02:20:42.191
<v Speaker 2>wrestler but you have knockout power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just knock everybody out fade or he </v>

2823
02:20:42.191 --> 02:20:46.601
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be stunned and he would see your </v>

2824
02:20:46.601 --> 02:20:46.601
<v Speaker 2>arm and he would dive into Kimora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2825
02:20:46.601 --> 02:20:50.891
<v Speaker 2>he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would always take the opportunity </v>

2826
02:20:50.891 --> 02:20:53.951
<v Speaker 2>that presented itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a grappling situation </v>

2827
02:20:53.951 --> 02:20:56.801
<v Speaker 2>where there was a striking situation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his well-roundedness was one of the </v>

2828
02:20:56.801 --> 02:20:58.700
<v Speaker 2>things that made him special on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his knockout power and his aggression,</v>

2829
02:20:58.970 --> 02:20:59.240
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>

2830
02:20:59.270 --> 02:21:04.270
<v Speaker 2>He was so well rounded who was his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to flow with whatever was </v>

2831
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:08.531
<v Speaker 2>happening and he also had that Hump </v>
<v Speaker 2>Humility and he had that calm like you,</v>

2832
02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:11.270
<v Speaker 2>like you saw holly had the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

2833
02:21:11.390 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again talking about social media.</v>

2834
02:21:12.921 --> 02:21:17.921
<v Speaker 2>I posted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't posted much on facebook the </v>

2835
02:21:17.921 --> 02:21:20.231
<v Speaker 2>facebook before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a video of holly talking </v>

2836
02:21:20.231 --> 02:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got beat by Sophia Mathias in </v>

2837
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a vicious fight.</v>

2838
02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laser kickboxing and boxing,</v>

2839
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:30.350
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2840
02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2841
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:32.750
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2842
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:37.751
<v Speaker 2>she gets destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly gets completely destroyed hanging </v>

2843
02:21:37.751 --> 02:21:38.210
<v Speaker 2>on the ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting punched in the head.</v>

2844
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you watch the post fight interview </v>

2845
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:44.640
<v Speaker 2>with her and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2846
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable because everything she</v>
<v Speaker 2>says she takes complete ownership of the</v>

2847
02:21:52.281 --> 02:21:53.750
<v Speaker 2>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

2848
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:56.420
<v Speaker 2>I had a great training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2849
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:58.280
<v Speaker 2>my coaches were telling me to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right things,</v>

2850
02:21:58.281 --> 02:22:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't doing what I was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

2851
02:22:00.021 --> 02:22:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't fighting the way I was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>

2852
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:07.030
<v Speaker 2>The reason I last night is my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this and I will have to change </v>

2853
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:11.540
<v Speaker 2>things if I'm going to beat her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing someone.</v>

2854
02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And the other part that was cool about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was she was getting emotional,</v>

2855
02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:17.570
<v Speaker 2>like you could see like she wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cry.</v>

2856
02:22:17.571 --> 02:22:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

2857
02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:23.610
<v Speaker 2>she kept control of her emotions and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

2858
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I saw that video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2859
02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:25.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl is,</v>

2860
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:25.800
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

2861
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:28.260
<v Speaker 3>going to do going to do well in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

2862
02:22:28.261 --> 02:22:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2863
02:22:28.591 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a pretty good feeling about it.</v>

2864
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

2865
02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:33.660
<v Speaker 3>she is incredibly solid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

2866
02:22:33.661 --> 02:22:37.920
<v Speaker 3>And that is so admirable when someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>does take ownership of their mistakes.</v>

2867
02:22:38.310 --> 02:22:40.590
<v Speaker 3>So important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so important.</v>

2868
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:43.530
<v Speaker 3>That's like we wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book is called extreme ownership,</v>

2869
02:22:43.531 --> 02:22:46.470
<v Speaker 3>that that's literally the time ladies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and gentlemen right there.</v>

2870
02:22:46.810 --> 02:22:47.540
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

2871
02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:52.580
<v Speaker 3>that is like the key though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason it's called that is because </v>

2872
02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:57.500
<v Speaker 3>when we made mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we owned up to him and furthermore when </v>

2873
02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>both Lafe and I ended up in positions </v>
<v Speaker 3>where we were teaching leadership,</v>

2874
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:05.811
<v Speaker 3>lead life was teaching the junior </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers that were coming out of the </v>

2875
02:23:05.811 --> 02:23:08.541
<v Speaker 3>seal training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting them through the junior officer </v>

2876
02:23:08.541 --> 02:23:08.541
<v Speaker 3>training course and I was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2877
02:23:08.541 --> 02:23:11.910
<v Speaker 3>the advanced guys and so you'd get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>seal officers and like I said,</v>

2878
02:23:11.911 --> 02:23:16.911
<v Speaker 3>we put these guys through horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>training scenarios where everyone was </v>

2879
02:23:16.911 --> 02:23:20.001
<v Speaker 3>getting killed and blown up and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be bought buddy carrying people through </v>

2880
02:23:20.001 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 3>the desert and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just awful.</v>

2881
02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:25.410
<v Speaker 3>And you come back from these situations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you talked to one of the,</v>

2882
02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:28.390
<v Speaker 3>let's say one of the good leaders and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>

2883
02:23:28.391 --> 02:23:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what went wrong?</v>

2884
02:23:29.310 --> 02:23:30.330
<v Speaker 3>And the guides say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2885
02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:34.020
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a clear enough plan.</v>

2886
02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:36.420
<v Speaker 3>No one really understood what my vision </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2887
02:23:36.570 --> 02:23:41.570
<v Speaker 3>They didn't execute because I obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't give them a good enough briefing </v>

2888
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:42.900
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2889
02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:47.960
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that guy would go and fix that </v>

2890
02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:50.211
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get a guy that was would not </v>

2891
02:23:50.211 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 3>take ownership of stuff that would come </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and say,</v>

2892
02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:53.380
<v Speaker 3>a user say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2893
02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.250
<v Speaker 3>what went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That training that was,</v>

2894
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:56.910
<v Speaker 3>you guys did a terrible job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

2895
02:23:56.911 --> 02:23:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2896
02:23:58.050 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2897
02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:03.560
<v Speaker 3>my assault force commander didn't wait </v>
<v Speaker 3>for my command before he left and he </v>

2898
02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:07.731
<v Speaker 3>screwed up and my platoon chief wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads up about where our casualties were</v>

2899
02:24:08.011 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 3>being taken and my Lpo and they'd make </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these excuses.</v>

2900
02:24:12.890 --> 02:24:17.890
<v Speaker 3>And it really was the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who would be successful and who </v>

2901
02:24:17.890 --> 02:24:21.261
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the guy that takes ownership of </v>

2902
02:24:21.261 --> 02:24:24.051
<v Speaker 3>the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the rest of his team </v>

2903
02:24:24.051 --> 02:24:24.051
<v Speaker 3>does?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just,</v>

2904
02:24:24.051 --> 02:24:29.050
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that person takes ownership of the </v>

2905
02:24:29.050 --> 02:24:31.431
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody on that team does the same </v>

2906
02:24:31.431 --> 02:24:31.431
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't say,</v>

2907
02:24:31.431 --> 02:24:31.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right boss.</v>

2908
02:24:31.431 --> 02:24:31.440
<v Speaker 3>It is your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2909
02:24:31.441 --> 02:24:32.310
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey boss,</v>

2910
02:24:32.311 --> 02:24:37.311
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually could have done a better job </v>

2911
02:24:37.311 --> 02:24:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and and that spreads through everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when someone says it wasn't my </v>

2912
02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:41.370
<v Speaker 3>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was joe's fault,</v>

2913
02:24:41.371 --> 02:24:42.960
<v Speaker 3>what does Joe do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Goes,</v>

2914
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:44.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't mine because I'm not getting</v>

2915
02:24:44.691 --> 02:24:46.020
<v Speaker 3>no blame each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and guess what?</v>

2916
02:24:46.021 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 3>The problem never gets lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2917
02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:53.720
<v Speaker 3>So to hear holly talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the fight and taking complete </v>

2918
02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:57.651
<v Speaker 3>ownership of a loss was very impressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me and then she went on to beat her </v>

2919
02:24:57.651 --> 02:24:58.330
<v Speaker 3>like six months later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelief.</v>

2920
02:24:58.420 --> 02:24:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2921
02:24:59.730 --> 02:25:04.730
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most important things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting good at anything is recognizing </v>

2922
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 3>when you're not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recognizing when you make mistakes.</v>

2923
02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:09.390
<v Speaker 3>It seems so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2924
02:25:09.391 --> 02:25:12.000
<v Speaker 3>But you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Ego.</v>

2925
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.700
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2926
02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:16.400
<v Speaker 3>everybody's ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like even even me,</v>

2927
02:25:16.401 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 3>because I sit here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact I teach people about,</v>

2928
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:23.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to keep your ego and there's </v>

2929
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.550
<v Speaker 3>a chapter in there like you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep your ego in check.</v>

2930
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.550
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2931
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>when somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll ask somebody,</v>

2932
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2933
02:25:24.641 --> 02:25:25.960
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I could have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in that,</v>

2934
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:29.200
<v Speaker 1>in that speech or in that class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll be like,</v>

2935
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2936
02:25:29.981 --> 02:25:31.080
<v Speaker 1>one thing that you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

2937
02:25:31.090 --> 02:25:33.540
<v Speaker 1>immediately I'm like for wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

2938
02:25:33.541 --> 02:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>like my ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2939
02:25:34.981 --> 02:25:36.340
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a loser.</v>

2940
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here telling them about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ego in check.</v>

2941
02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does it all the time.</v>

2942
02:25:44.141 --> 02:25:49.141
<v Speaker 1>No one can take criticism and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that biggest step of moving </v>

2943
02:25:49.141 --> 02:25:53.521
<v Speaker 1>forward is a is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is learning how to take ownership of </v>

2944
02:25:53.521 --> 02:25:53.740
<v Speaker 1>stuff and when it goes sideways and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely will.</v>

2945
02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Well you need some form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some amount of pride and some amount of </v>

2946
02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:02.880
<v Speaker 1>ego to get good at things in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because it's such a cow </v>

2947
02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive notion because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a belief in yourself.</v>

2948
02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:07.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you,</v>

2949
02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:09.450
<v Speaker 1>when you first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start out at Jujitsu,</v>

2950
02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.180
<v Speaker 1>your white belt.</v>

2951
02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember being a white belt and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2952
02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.520
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fucking never going to get good at </v>

2953
02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:17.520
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to suck forever,</v>

2954
02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.380
<v Speaker 1>but to to to look at people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you and no,</v>

2955
02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:22.780
<v Speaker 1>they had to have sucked at one point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2956
02:26:22.781 --> 02:26:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be somewhere along the end</v>

2957
02:26:25.721 --> 02:26:27.550
<v Speaker 1>of this tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a light.</v>

2958
02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I just gotTa keep going and Tigo Ego was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>

2959
02:26:32.301 --> 02:26:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego drives you to be successful me to be</v>

2960
02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:37.980
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egos.</v>

2961
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:42.990
<v Speaker 1>What's driving you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you let ego go too </v>

2962
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:42.990
<v Speaker 1>far and you know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2963
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:45.160
<v Speaker 1>everything takes balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a dichotomy and everything,</v>

2964
02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.710
<v Speaker 1>every part of you has a dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2965
02:26:47.711 --> 02:26:52.711
<v Speaker 1>you can get so into the physical aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that you end up like doing a </v>

2966
02:26:52.711 --> 02:26:54.820
<v Speaker 1>bunch of steroids and going crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruining your health.</v>

2967
02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other end of the spectrum,</v>

2968
02:26:58.421 --> 02:27:03.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit around and play video games </v>

2969
02:27:03.421 --> 02:27:03.421
<v Speaker 1>and turned into A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2970
02:27:03.421 --> 02:27:03.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2971
02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:04.360
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2972
02:27:04.470 --> 02:27:09.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilding is the best example of </v>

2973
02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:09.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2974
02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of dying out though,</v>

2975
02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:11.450
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of bonded.</v>

2976
02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Building out their stuff to you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2977
02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:20.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a giant culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there that want to look like </v>

2978
02:27:20.850 --> 02:27:21.940
<v Speaker 1>huge mutant still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2979
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not in that world,</v>

2980
02:27:24.161 --> 02:27:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a bodybuilding is a great example</v>

2981
02:27:27.641 --> 02:27:30.310
<v Speaker 1>of that because when you start lifting </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights like,</v>

2982
02:27:30.311 --> 02:27:35.311
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be stronger and you start </v>

2983
02:27:35.311 --> 02:27:35.311
<v Speaker 1>getting a little bit bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2984
02:27:35.311 --> 02:27:35.311
<v Speaker 1>oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a muscle,</v>

2985
02:27:35.311 --> 02:27:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cool,</v>

2986
02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:37.630
<v Speaker 1>and then you keep going and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

2987
02:27:37.930 --> 02:27:40.480
<v Speaker 1>But some guys get so fucking crazy.</v>

2988
02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:45.480
<v Speaker 1>They won't stop until they have 22 inch </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms and they want to have thighs that </v>

2989
02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:46.360
<v Speaker 1>are so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to walk like they're,</v>

2990
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:48.700
<v Speaker 1>they've got a barrel in between their </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs and you know,</v>

2991
02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't help but they just take </v>

2992
02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:53.880
<v Speaker 1>it to some completely unhealthy place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2993
02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:55.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's rough.</v>

2994
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2995
02:27:55.961 --> 02:27:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it's just the nature of trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at something.</v>

2996
02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:03.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got to recognize what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is just fucking insane.</v>

2997
02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:08.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it happens in training camps with </v>

2998
02:28:08.641 --> 02:28:08.641
<v Speaker 1>fighters all the time to retrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad,</v>

2999
02:28:08.641 --> 02:28:12.130
<v Speaker 1>big part of the problem with a mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

3000
02:28:12.131 --> 02:28:17.131
<v Speaker 1>so obvious too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're overtraining somebody </v>

3001
02:28:17.131 --> 02:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>because all of the sudden like one night</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just fall apart and they just </v>

3002
02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>won't be able to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3003
02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:19.770
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3004
02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:23.210
<v Speaker 1>go eat two steaks and take two off </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will get to a point.</v>

3005
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 1>You just feel them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just feel and fall apart.</v>

3006
02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to monitor your heart rate.</v>

3007
02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters don't do.</v>

3008
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Monitor your resting heart rate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and if it goes up more than five</v>

3009
02:28:33.381 --> 02:28:38.381
<v Speaker 1>beats in a day or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely year overtrained or you're </v>

3010
02:28:38.381 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 1>sick or you're struggling with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make.</v>

3011
02:28:40.821 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Steve Maxwell taught me that trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3012
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:45.170
<v Speaker 1>every fighter should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And none of them do.</v>

3013
02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:50.500
<v Speaker 1>They should monitor their heart rate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every morning his heart rate is like </v>

3014
02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:52.820
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Maxwell can fucking.</v>

3015
02:28:52.850 --> 02:28:55.490
<v Speaker 1>He can deal with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just one of those dudes,</v>

3016
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:57.080
<v Speaker 1>but he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's another guy I want to talk about.</v>

3017
02:28:57.081 --> 02:29:02.081
<v Speaker 1>A guy who's got a lifetime of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to strength and conditioning and </v>

3018
02:29:02.081 --> 02:29:05.180
<v Speaker 1>what he calls physical culture and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of taking care of your body.</v>

3019
02:29:05.810 --> 02:29:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty two or 63 years old,</v>

3020
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:11.240
<v Speaker 1>fit as a fiddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travels all around the world,</v>

3021
02:29:11.241 --> 02:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>training people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all he does.</v>

3022
02:29:12.730 --> 02:29:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

3023
02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:19.420
<v Speaker 1>He has a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bag that he brings with him when he </v>

3024
02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:20.090
<v Speaker 1>travels around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this stuff's in that bag.</v>

3025
02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I ran into her in San Diego because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been downsizing and when I.</v>

3026
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:26.660
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ran into him in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego,</v>

3027
02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:31.720
<v Speaker 1>he was down to living in an rv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I first met him.</v>

3028
02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I hear him on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3029
02:29:34.761 --> 02:29:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year later or two years later and he's</v>

3030
02:29:37.310 --> 02:29:39.620
<v Speaker 1>not have all my worldly possessions in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>

3031
02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sold his rv and he's like,</v>

3032
02:29:42.171 --> 02:29:47.171
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if he has a bank </v>

3033
02:29:47.171 --> 02:29:47.171
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3034
02:29:47.171 --> 02:29:47.300
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a strange cat man.</v>

3035
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:52.010
<v Speaker 1>He really is a strange cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a very at peace guy for sure.</v>

3036
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3037
02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:54.800
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to live like that.</v>

3038
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't like living like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's also been the guy that's lived </v>

3039
02:29:59.950 --> 02:30:00.170
<v Speaker 1>the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's had the house and needs that.</v>

3040
02:30:00.171 --> 02:30:05.171
<v Speaker 1>The family and his son Zack is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful Jujitsu competitor and you </v>

3041
02:30:05.561 --> 02:30:07.550
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got divorced and gave up the gym.</v>

3042
02:30:07.551 --> 02:30:08.420
<v Speaker 1>He had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

3043
02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:10.130
<v Speaker 1>all the trappings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had everything.</v>

3044
02:30:10.131 --> 02:30:10.660
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3045
02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I like it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this backpack.</v>

3046
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the key word there was trapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he somehow built all these things </v>

3047
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:20.780
<v Speaker 1>around them that felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ended up making them feel trapped.</v>

3048
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For him it's just he would.</v>

3049
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:25.160
<v Speaker 1>He figured out what he enjoys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He enjoys training,</v>

3050
02:30:25.210 --> 02:30:28.490
<v Speaker 1>still doing Jujitsu to this day and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches a course,</v>

3051
02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:33.520

<v Speaker 1>about maintaining your health while you </v>

<v Speaker 1>train and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's written articles on training,</v>

3053
02:30:36.171 --> 02:30:41.171
<v Speaker 1>smart to avoid injuries as you get older</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know how to pick the right </v>

3061
02:30:55.551 --> 02:31:00.551

<v Speaker 1>to ease into it a little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Got To pick your training partners </v>

<v Speaker 1>carefully and there's always gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that hurts people.</v>

3071
02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:34.500
<v Speaker 1>There was just this giant German dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to roll it.</v>

3072
02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Our gym is to always get everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg locks and blow their knees out and </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many times,</v>

3076
02:31:45.691 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3077
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:50.610
<v Speaker 1>we might be talking thousands of times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>heel hook,</v>

3078
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:52.080
<v Speaker 1>knee locked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3079

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3080
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten him,</v>

3081
02:31:55.310 --> 02:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not thousand signs with plenty of times </v>

3082
02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>and we've never heard each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3083
02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:01.020
<v Speaker 1>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what we're doing.</v>

3084
02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd way rather roll with a black belt </v>

3085
02:32:06.140 --> 02:32:06.420
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then some fucking psycho blue belt.</v>

3086
02:32:08.390 --> 02:32:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they just,</v>

3087
02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:16.180
<v Speaker 1>they spazz out and they head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you accidentally and weird shit </v>

3088
02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:16.180
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3089
02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:17.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3090
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:21.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing is a,</v>

3091
02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:25.890
<v Speaker 1>that Anthony Bourdain has gotten crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Jujitsu over the last,</v>

3092
02:32:25.891 --> 02:32:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I think two years now.</v>

3093
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:29.670
<v Speaker 1>He just earned his blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 59.</v>

3094
02:32:30.090 --> 02:32:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3095
02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:32.070
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

3096
02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lifetime of smoking cigarettes,</v>

3097
02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:37.230
<v Speaker 1>doing heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like never,</v>

3098
02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:42.260
<v Speaker 1>never was fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never exercise at all when I first met </v>

3099
02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:42.260
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3100
02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:45.770
<v Speaker 1>like he would laugh about fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted to drink beer and you </v>

3101
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:46.330
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3102
02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.390
<v Speaker 1>the first time we did my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got so high,</v>

3103
02:32:48.391 --> 02:32:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how we talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3104
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:55.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did a TV show like a couple of </v>

3105
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:55.990
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in Montana.</v>

3106
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:58.200
<v Speaker 1>All he wanted to talk about Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed.</v>

3107
02:32:58.201 --> 02:33:03.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm showing them some techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about different guys that </v>

3108
02:33:03.201 --> 02:33:06.531
<v Speaker 1>liked to do different things at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different approaches and gay versus no </v>

3109
02:33:06.531 --> 02:33:06.670
<v Speaker 1>gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And John Donner,</v>

3110
02:33:06.671 --> 02:33:11.671
<v Speaker 1>her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tone in an Eddy Commons and all </v>

3111
02:33:11.671 --> 02:33:11.671
<v Speaker 1>these different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3112
02:33:11.671 --> 02:33:14.250
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe what a transformation.</v>

3113
02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:16.430
<v Speaker 1>This guy's overtaken Jujitsu.</v>

3114
02:33:16.470 --> 02:33:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3115
02:33:18.031 --> 02:33:20.070
<v Speaker 1>people can get into all kinds of weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

3116
02:33:20.071 --> 02:33:21.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get into surfing,</v>

3117
02:33:21.541 --> 02:33:24.150
<v Speaker 1>people get into skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get into rock climbing.</v>

3118
02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.720
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more in Jujitsu that gets into </v>

3119
02:33:31.861 --> 02:33:34.110
<v Speaker 1>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it definitely happened to me.</v>

3120
02:33:34.111 --> 02:33:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was completely and I still am.</v>

3121
02:33:36.811 --> 02:33:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still cannot stop a youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>video of a cool move.</v>

3122
02:33:40.021 --> 02:33:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to watch it.</v>

3123
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because there's such a </v>

3124
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:47.820
<v Speaker 1>cerebral part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it.</v>

3125
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:53.150
<v Speaker 1>And I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know we teach kids and you'll see </v>

3126
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3127
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:55.470
<v Speaker 1>the knucklehead kids that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckle dragging kids are kind of big.</v>

3128
02:33:56.250 --> 02:33:58.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't really get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you get this kid,</v>

3129
02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:01.050
<v Speaker 1>some smart kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell they're smart and those are</v>

3130
02:34:01.051 --> 02:34:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the kids that get really into Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they realize like,</v>

3131
02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I learned this,</v>

3132
02:34:05.011 --> 02:34:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I can beat that big kid.</v>

3133
02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where it starts.</v>

3134
02:34:08.071 --> 02:34:09.930
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu can definitely be addictive.</v>

3135
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu's the only martial art where it </v>

3136
02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:17.931
<v Speaker 1>really works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the Bruce Lee movie where the </v>

3137
02:34:17.931 --> 02:34:20.871
<v Speaker 1>little guy really can beat the big guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the reality is like if you watch</v>

3138
02:34:21.490 --> 02:34:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the old k one days where Bob Sapp was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting when Bob Sapp was 375 pounds </v>

3139
02:34:29.171 --> 02:34:30.490
<v Speaker 1>with ABS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3140
02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was he on steroids.</v>

3141
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:38.740
<v Speaker 1>He was steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing human left.</v>

3142
02:34:39.250 --> 02:34:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And he beat or Nesto hoost twice who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably one of the top two or three </v>

3143
02:34:46.181 --> 02:34:51.181
<v Speaker 1>greatest kickboxers ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Bob Sapp just bum rushed him and </v>

3144
02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:56.700
<v Speaker 1>donkey Kong dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just beat them down with clubbing </v>

3145
02:34:56.700 --> 02:34:57.310
<v Speaker 1>punches because he was so much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than him.</v>

3146
02:34:57.550 --> 02:35:00.040
<v Speaker 1>He was more than 150 pounds bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>him probably.</v>

3147
02:35:00.041 --> 02:35:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he used it at his biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like 2:30.</v>

3148
02:35:03.191 --> 02:35:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Japan.</v>

3149
02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I was with dean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

3150
02:35:07.061 --> 02:35:09.840
<v Speaker 1>when Nogueira submitted sap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was insane.</v>

3151
02:35:09.890 --> 02:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>

3152
02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:13.060
<v Speaker 1>That was a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3153
02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:18.061
<v Speaker 1>a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to be Nogueira though because </v>

3154
02:35:18.061 --> 02:35:18.061
<v Speaker 1>sap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sap dropped him on his head.</v>

3155
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Pile drived him on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him the next day.</v>

3156
02:35:21.911 --> 02:35:25.420
<v Speaker 1>No Gira,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after the fight and he was hurt.</v>

3157
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was up bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3158
02:35:27.791 --> 02:35:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big neck.</v>

3159
02:35:28.991 --> 02:35:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Was fucked up apparently forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that I,</v>

3160
02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:34.570
<v Speaker 1>he hit his neck essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never recovered after that fight,</v>

3161
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the fights that fate or </v>

3162
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.750
<v Speaker 1>passed on fader wouldn't fight Bob's </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3163
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:40.090
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

3164
02:35:40.290 --> 02:35:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you can take your fucking clown show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your circus act and no heroes.</v>

3165
02:35:44.490 --> 02:35:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fader was like,</v>

3166
02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:49.630
<v Speaker 1>no thanks on the freak show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

3167
02:35:49.631 --> 02:35:53.050
<v Speaker 1>he went and fought troy who's a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy too,</v>

3168
02:35:53.051 --> 02:35:58.051
<v Speaker 1>but giant actually gigantism giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not giant like juice to the gills giant.</v>

3169
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:01.400
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sat,</v>

3170
02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean all power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a law against it and he</v>

3171
02:36:05.471 --> 02:36:10.471
<v Speaker 1>went in there and they were paying them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how he made a ton of money </v>

3172
02:36:10.471 --> 02:36:11.350
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that in Jujitsu,</v>

3173
02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:16.650
<v Speaker 1>like maybe an MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit different because you </v>

3174
02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:19.370
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously Bob Sapp Drop Nogueira on his </v>

3175
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:19.370
<v Speaker 1>head and most people would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done then,</v>

3176
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:23.670
<v Speaker 1>but Nogueira was legendarily tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a small man can tap out a much </v>

3177
02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:26.890
<v Speaker 1>larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger man on a regular basis.</v>

3178
02:36:27.130 --> 02:36:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I watched Rigo Rodriguez in Abu Dhabi go</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Marcello Garcia.</v>

3179
02:36:30.941 --> 02:36:35.770
<v Speaker 1>I was there and were either in La and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Rico threw them on his bed,</v>

3180
02:36:35.771 --> 02:36:40.771
<v Speaker 1>when Marcel took Rico's back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so rico through himself backwards and </v>

3181
02:36:40.771 --> 02:36:44.821
<v Speaker 1>slammed on top of Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Marcel was like a backpack on </v>

3182
02:36:44.821 --> 02:36:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Rico's back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rico's like 2:40</v>

3183
02:36:46.361 --> 02:36:51.361
<v Speaker 1>something maybe even heavier through </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself backwards and landed all his </v>

3184
02:36:51.361 --> 02:36:54.400
<v Speaker 1>weight on Marcello ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shook it off and leg lock them.</v>

3185
02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 1>They're incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>

3186
02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean Marcella was like 160 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one 70 maybe,</v>

3187
02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:06.660
<v Speaker 1>but just so skilled and so dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>with his Jujitsu that he was the </v>

3188
02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:08.170
<v Speaker 1>favorite in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>

3189
02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:13.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I think that addiction </v>

3190
02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:13.320
<v Speaker 1>comes in because I think it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cerebral thing where people realize that</v>

3191
02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this real force.</v>

3192
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>We're now one</v>

3193
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:17.300
<v Speaker 2>of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3194
02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:18.890
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid asked me,</v>

3195
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:20.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie the incredibles.</v>

3196
02:37:20.370 --> 02:37:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kid.</v>

3197
02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.720
<v Speaker 2>These people have superpowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

3198
02:37:23.721 --> 02:37:25.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son asked me a data,</v>

3199
02:37:25.511 --> 02:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>is there really such a thing as </v>
<v Speaker 2>superpowers?</v>

3200
02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is definitely a super power.</v>

3201
02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:38.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you remember the days before anybody </v>

3202
02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:38.560
<v Speaker 2>knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you need a little tiny bit,</v>

3203
02:37:38.810 --> 02:37:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you were just get viewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can stop you.</v>

3204
02:37:41.091 --> 02:37:41.620
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

3205
02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:46.860
<v Speaker 1>What's also amazing to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression of Jujitsu in comparison in </v>

3206
02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:50.761
<v Speaker 1>1993 because the Jujitsu of 1993 was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive in comparison to what you have</v>

3207
02:37:50.951 --> 02:37:55.951
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guys who are winning with </v>

3208
02:37:55.951 --> 02:37:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God though the setups were so obvious,</v>

3209
02:37:56.530 --> 02:38:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you could see the arm bars a mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing crazy or weird about </v>

3210
02:38:01.530 --> 02:38:05.671
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at that in comparison to </v>

3211
02:38:05.671 --> 02:38:05.671
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jacques Array,</v>

3212
02:38:05.671 --> 02:38:07.660
<v Speaker 1>like when Jocko array gets armbars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a work of art.</v>

3213
02:38:08.050 --> 02:38:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3214
02:38:08.431 --> 02:38:10.420
<v Speaker 1>you watch his setups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look good,</v>

3215
02:38:10.421 --> 02:38:15.421
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he tapped Chris Kamozi with an arm </v>

3216
02:38:15.421 --> 02:38:18.310
<v Speaker 1>bar and I've watched the transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he controlled them on the ground</v>

3217
02:38:18.311 --> 02:38:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and the scrambled to arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably watched it 40 times in a row.</v>

3218
02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.040
<v Speaker 1>I just played it back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

3219
02:38:24.041 --> 02:38:26.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

3220
02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I needed perfect placement of the Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knee that pressure,</v>

3221
02:38:31.121 --> 02:38:33.070
<v Speaker 1>the hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's in place.</v>

3222
02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>The control of the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a,</v>

3223
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:37.990
<v Speaker 1>it was a done deal from the moment he </v>
<v Speaker 1>started his movements.</v>

3224
02:38:38.610 --> 02:38:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Now that to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just as beautiful as any painting</v>

3225
02:38:41.861 --> 02:38:44.110
<v Speaker 1>than anybody's ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt.</v>

3226
02:38:44.111 --> 02:38:46.780
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent is an art to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

3227
02:38:47.050 --> 02:38:48.040
<v Speaker 1>What year did you start?</v>

3228
02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]?</v>

3229
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Ninety two or 93.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3230
02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:53.510
<v Speaker 2>You got an early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got an early.</v>

3231
02:38:53.511 --> 02:38:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Luckily I had a pre UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3232
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:58.610
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew when we launched that first UFC,</v>

3233
02:38:58.611 --> 02:39:03.611
<v Speaker 2>we all knew while there were stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four of us that knew that </v>

3234
02:39:03.611 --> 02:39:05.180
<v Speaker 2>hoists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that release Gracie was going to rise.</v>

3235
02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:11.650
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this old seal master chief old </v>

3236
02:39:11.650 --> 02:39:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seal master chief named Steve Bailey.</v>

3237
02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like a high level white belt and </v>

3238
02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.730
<v Speaker 2>he had trained with flooring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gracie up in the garage,</v>

3239
02:39:20.810 --> 02:39:24.950
<v Speaker 2>open torrents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he knew he knew Jujitsu garage,</v>

3240
02:39:24.951 --> 02:39:27.490
<v Speaker 2>the infamous garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the epicenter.</v>

3241
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:33.150
<v Speaker 2>No kid in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this Guy Steve Bailey had trained </v>

3242
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:36.521
<v Speaker 2>there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day we were over on deployment over </v>

3243
02:39:36.521 --> 02:39:36.521
<v Speaker 2>in Guam and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3244
02:39:36.521 --> 02:39:37.610
<v Speaker 2>who here wants to learn how to fight?</v>

02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to learn how to fight.</v>

3246
02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And he just took us all and just choked </v>
<v Speaker 2>us all out,</v>

3247
02:39:42.141 --> 02:39:42.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

3248
02:39:42.801 --> 02:39:43.280
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3249
02:39:43.281 --> 02:39:45.290
<v Speaker 2>you attack me and just chokes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3250
02:39:45.291 --> 02:39:50.291
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll listen to whatever this guy is </v>

3251
02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:50.291
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3252
02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:50.291
<v Speaker 2>So he taught us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3253
02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:50.300
<v Speaker 2>the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3254
02:39:50.301 --> 02:39:55.301
<v Speaker 2>like the rear naked choke and the arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>lock and like the American or something </v>

3255
02:39:56.181 --> 02:39:56.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3256
02:39:56.511 --> 02:40:00.890
<v Speaker 2>we're talking like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 2>different moves and with those moves,</v>

3257
02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:01.850
<v Speaker 2>like I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3258
02:40:01.851 --> 02:40:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I every scrap I'd get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3259
02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I just force someone into the rear naked</v>
<v Speaker 2>choke or force them,</v>

3260
02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:09.830
<v Speaker 2>but they had no idea what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was actually amazing.</v>

3261
02:40:10.310 --> 02:40:10.940
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3262
02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:13.470
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought at that time that,</v>

3263
02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3264
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that was Jujitsu like was this finite </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing a lot of people did.</v>

3265
02:40:18.211 --> 02:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize,</v>

3266
02:40:19.801 --> 02:40:24.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's completely unending and it </v>

3267
02:40:24.801 --> 02:40:27.981
<v Speaker 1>changes every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John John Machado had a guy that moved </v>

3268
02:40:27.981 --> 02:40:31.350
<v Speaker 1>to black belt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very good martial artist.</v>

3269
02:40:31.351 --> 02:40:33.180
<v Speaker 1>He was very physically strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

3270
02:40:33.181 --> 02:40:37.130
<v Speaker 1>he was a big bulky dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a naturally big bone,</v>

3271
02:40:37.131 --> 02:40:42.131
<v Speaker 1>strong guy that gave people a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and then decided like,</v>

3272
02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:45.900
<v Speaker 1>didn't just decide this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but set it publicly.</v>

3273
02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I've learned all I could learn about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and now I'm going to learn all I</v>

3274
02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:53.370
<v Speaker 1>can learn about Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody just went,</v>

3275
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:54.780
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done with you.</v>

3276
02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

3277
02:40:55.741 --> 02:41:00.741
<v Speaker 1>it was so ridiculed in the community and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the people in school that everybody.</v>

3278
02:41:01.231 --> 02:41:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like a blue belt at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

3279
02:41:03.391 --> 02:41:04.890
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this guy on?</v>

3280
02:41:05.130 --> 02:41:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you learned everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you learn every.</v>

3281
02:41:07.331 --> 02:41:09.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu doesn't end.</v>

3282
02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:11.730
<v Speaker 1>It goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't get.</v>

3283
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:13.740
<v Speaker 1>You can always get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3284
02:41:13.741 --> 02:41:17.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not something until you achieve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of light.</v>

3285
02:41:18.410 --> 02:41:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another great thing about Jujitsu is </v>

3286
02:41:23.410 --> 02:41:25.410
<v Speaker 1>because it like combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reflects life.</v>

3287
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:28.590
<v Speaker 1>End of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start saying that you're good to go.</v>

3288
02:41:28.591 --> 02:41:33.591
<v Speaker 1>Like in a leadership position or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever task you're working on the day </v>

3289
02:41:33.591 --> 02:41:37.221
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned everything there is to </v>

3290
02:41:37.221 --> 02:41:37.221
<v Speaker 1>learn about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the day you start to lose.</v>

3291
02:41:37.221 --> 02:41:41.660
<v Speaker 1>And I know that humility is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to keep yourself in check.</v>

3292
02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got asked the other day,</v>

3293
02:41:46.741 --> 02:41:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when were you,</v>

3294
02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:51.150
<v Speaker 1>when was your high point of leadership?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3295
02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:52.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had high point of leadership.</v>

3296
02:41:52.651 --> 02:41:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I was always trying to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always trying to figure out what I</v>

3297
02:41:55.471 --> 02:42:00.060
<v Speaker 1>was doing wrong and what mistakes I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>making because if you don't do that,</v>

3298
02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:00.480
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

3299
02:42:00.730 --> 02:42:02.190
<v Speaker 1>That's something I learned from Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

3300
02:42:02.191 --> 02:42:07.191
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do that then that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get passed by and other people </v>

3301
02:42:07.191 --> 02:42:11.031
<v Speaker 1>are going to figure something new way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it and you're going to be left in </v>

3302
02:42:11.031 --> 02:42:11.031
<v Speaker 1>the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3303
02:42:11.031 --> 02:42:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Is much as I like to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the term that was perfect.</v>

3304
02:42:13.201 --> 02:42:15.930
<v Speaker 1>There really is nothing perfect in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

3305
02:42:15.931 --> 02:42:20.931
<v Speaker 1>There's always room for improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a shorter path is always </v>

3306
02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:21.030
<v Speaker 1>a quicker victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always,</v>

3307
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:26.300
<v Speaker 1>there's always new things to learn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you start thinking that </v>

3308
02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:30.030
<v Speaker 1>you've mastered something to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3309
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:31.530
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an end,</v>

3310
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:35.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you kinda missed out what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all about in the first place,</v>

3311
02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:37.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly uncomfortable.</v>

3312
02:42:37.531 --> 02:42:39.000
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable,</v>

3313
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:41.100
<v Speaker 1>and then in these little victories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

3314
02:42:41.101 --> 02:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>the good thing about when people tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

3315
02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:45.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a little nice feeling right here.</v>

3316
02:42:45.250 --> 02:42:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go again,</v>

3317
02:42:46.410 --> 02:42:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

3318
02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Back to being uncomfortable and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no getting around and then he taps you </v>

3319
02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:56.301
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit should have quit while I was </v>

3320
02:42:56.301 --> 02:42:56.301
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3321
02:42:56.301 --> 02:42:56.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're missing the point.</v>

3322
02:42:56.301 --> 02:42:58.890
<v Speaker 1>The point is that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a long path,</v>

3323
02:42:59.090 --> 02:43:04.090
<v Speaker 1>a long arduous path and I think anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worth doing is probably like </v>

3324
02:43:04.090 --> 02:43:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

3325
02:43:05.981 --> 02:43:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's another,</v>

3326
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:10.890
<v Speaker 1>another piece again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another place where Jujitsu is like</v>

3327
02:43:12.430 --> 02:43:17.430
<v Speaker 3>is eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think at some point you think you </v>

3328
02:43:17.430 --> 02:43:18.550
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think you're good,</v>

3329
02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:23.560
<v Speaker 3>you think you're doing pretty good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you just get smacked or you get </v>

3330
02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:26.800
<v Speaker 3>smacked with something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like now like when you were 25,</v>

3331
02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:27.880
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty,</v>

3332
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3333
02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:31.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much know what's up.</v>

3334
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:33.340
<v Speaker 3>And then when you're 30 you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything.</v>

3335
02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:37.570
<v Speaker 3>I was idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's true like even.</v>

3336
02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And so I think one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that provide some </v>

3337
02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:46.951
<v Speaker 3>small portion of like maturity as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being and as a man is when you get</v>

3338
02:43:47.231 --> 02:43:52.231
<v Speaker 3>to the point where you actually realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't know everything and </v>

3339
02:43:52.231 --> 02:43:52.780
<v Speaker 3>you're like looking at yourself like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>44,</v>

3340
02:43:52.781 --> 02:43:53.710
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3341
02:43:53.770 --> 02:43:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to learn so much in the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>three years,</v>

3342
02:43:56.471 --> 02:44:01.471
<v Speaker 3>five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to look at myself at 44 and </v>

3343
02:44:01.471 --> 02:44:03.631
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to see how stupid you were </v>

3344
02:44:03.631 --> 02:44:03.631
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you come to that realization,</v>

3345
02:44:03.631 --> 02:44:08.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a pretty positive thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it takes a while to figure out </v>

3346
02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:08.950
<v Speaker 3>that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have everything figured out.</v>

3347
02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty stupid right now even </v>

3348
02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>though you don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3349
02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that things like Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach you,</v>

3350
02:44:15.451 --> 02:44:20.451
<v Speaker 1>and I say Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really an all martial arts </v>

3351
02:44:20.451 --> 02:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the other martial arts </v>

3352
02:44:24.470 --> 02:44:25.230
<v Speaker 1>other than Jujitsu is at a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>

3353
02:44:25.231 --> 02:44:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you can't really practice them 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

3354
02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like striking.</v>

3355
02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:33.880
<v Speaker 1>You really can't practice striking 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent for very long or your brain </v>

3356
02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:36.870
<v Speaker 1>starts to give out just the fact and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

3357
02:44:36.871 --> 02:44:38.940
<v Speaker 1>you can Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it deep,</v>

3358
02:44:38.941 --> 02:44:41.360
<v Speaker 1>deep into your fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's like a.</v>

3359
02:44:41.390 --> 02:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>we're Anthony Bourdain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pushing 60,</v>

3360
02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:46.470
<v Speaker 1>still doing it and you know it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's going to be a world beater,</v>

3361
02:44:46.471 --> 02:44:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but he can get the most out of it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most that he can get out of it.</v>

3362
02:44:50.190 --> 02:44:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It's that stays the same like what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of it stays the same regardless </v>

3363
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:59.730
<v Speaker 1>of your were regardless of the success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you're getting out of it.</v>

3364
02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're getting tapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting out of is doing your</v>

3365
02:45:03.001 --> 02:45:08.001
<v Speaker 1>best and overcoming and improving upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your best is every day and doing so</v>

3366
02:45:09.330 --> 02:45:12.810
<v Speaker 1>in a situation where there is extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

3367
02:45:12.811 --> 02:45:17.811
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get strangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to get your arm </v>

3368
02:45:17.811 --> 02:45:17.811
<v Speaker 1>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't tap,</v>

3369
02:45:17.811 --> 02:45:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your leg fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't tap,</v>

3370
02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:22.260
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as extreme as combat obviously,</v>

3371
02:45:22.261 --> 02:45:27.261
<v Speaker 1>but it is extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get in a sport that you're </v>

3372
02:45:27.271 --> 02:45:32.271
<v Speaker 1>participating in an activity that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in voluntarily in America </v>

3373
02:45:32.701 --> 02:45:34.260
<v Speaker 1>at 5:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Tuesday,</v>

3374
02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:36.480
<v Speaker 1>where are you going to get 30 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to show up,</v>

3375
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:40.940
<v Speaker 1>slap hands together and then hug it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>after it's over and go,</v>

3376
02:45:40.980 --> 02:45:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna be here tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3377
02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:43.700
<v Speaker 1>RLC man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

3378
02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>back again tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

3379
02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:45.860
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

3380
02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:50.860
<v Speaker 3>another kind of primal piece that makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu so intense is if you and me role</v>

3381
02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:03.340
<v Speaker 3>like and I get you or you get me and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>tap in my heart.</v>

3382
02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:08.540
<v Speaker 3>I know that if you and I were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>for survival,</v>

3383
02:46:08.930 --> 02:46:12.890
<v Speaker 3>I just lost and you woulda killed me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this with little kids.</v>

3384
02:46:12.891 --> 02:46:15.320
<v Speaker 3>When kids compete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tell them,</v>

3385
02:46:15.390 --> 02:46:16.220
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go out there.</v>

3386
02:46:16.221 --> 02:46:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Have Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fun.</v>

3387
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:19.430
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go out there and do your best.</v>

3388
02:46:19.431 --> 02:46:21.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go out and have a good time.</v>

3389
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:22.670
<v Speaker 3>You tell them that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tell them that,</v>

3390
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:27.210
<v Speaker 3>tell them that if they get tapped date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they start crying.</v>

3391
02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

3392
02:46:29.181 --> 02:46:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Because a part of them inside their head</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't even know exists,</v>

3393
02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:38.540
<v Speaker 1>knows that that person had they been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mortal struggle.</v>

3394
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They got beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got their ass kicked.</v>

3395
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like someone.</v>

3396
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:45.860
<v Speaker 1>This is what I always say like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>dunks a basketball on you.</v>

3397
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean anything unless you </v>

3398
02:46:50.910 --> 02:46:51.800
<v Speaker 1>decide it means something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does basketball escalate into?</v>

3399
02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:54.370
<v Speaker 1>We'll do all sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sports escalate into finance.</v>

3400
02:46:54.550 --> 02:46:56.330
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get rid of the bat.</v>

3401
02:46:56.810 --> 02:46:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fight.</v>

3402
02:46:57.951 --> 02:46:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's,</v>

3403
02:46:59.120 --> 02:46:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the,</v>

3404
02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that UFC has been so highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful because it is,</v>

3405
02:47:02.931 --> 02:47:05.240
<v Speaker 1>it's what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate,</v>

3406
02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:06.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in combat sport again,</v>

3407
02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barring combat itself.</v>

3408
02:47:08.890 --> 02:47:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also why the dorks and pencil </v>
<v Speaker 1>next hate it so much because they think </v>

3409
02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:13.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a regression.</v>

3410
02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Back to the primal days of caveman </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

3411
02:47:16.371 --> 02:47:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we supporting some fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck wrote an article for the New Yorker</v>

3412
02:47:20.781 --> 02:47:24.090
<v Speaker 1>or New York Post or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Ronda Rousey loss,</v>

3413
02:47:24.091 --> 02:47:26.940
<v Speaker 1>about how barbaric and disgusting it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

3414
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:27.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3415
02:47:27.351 --> 02:47:29.830
<v Speaker 1>what bullshit that we were fed and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3416
02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:34.940
<v Speaker 1>were made out that she was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconquerable in to watch her beaten </v>

3417
02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:37.760
<v Speaker 1>unconscious was disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't get it man.</v>

3418
02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't get it like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with your fat face,</v>

3419
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like shoving cheeseburgers down your mug</v>
<v Speaker 1>is way worse than anything that she did </v>

3420
02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.750
<v Speaker 1>inside that octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because that</v>

3421
02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:53.340
<v Speaker 3>kind of attitude can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can cross borders into other things.</v>

3422
02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:54.640
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3423
02:47:54.690 --> 02:47:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I end up talking to people you know,</v>

3424
02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:57.820
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through our company,</v>

3425
02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:03.120
<v Speaker 3>people that are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean every like I'll be in a room </v>

3426
02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:03.890
<v Speaker 3>with everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to an Ivy League college,</v>

3427
02:48:03.891 --> 02:48:07.450
<v Speaker 3>had been super successful in their worth</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions if not hundreds of</v>

3428
02:48:07.450 --> 02:48:12.450
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was given one of these talks the </v>

3429
02:48:12.450 --> 02:48:12.450
<v Speaker 3>other day and we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3430
02:48:12.450 --> 02:48:14.800
<v Speaker 3>of course they ended up asking me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis and all that.</v>

3431
02:48:15.610 --> 02:48:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And as I'm sitting there looking and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking to myself like,</v>

3432
02:48:20.110 --> 02:48:25.110
<v Speaker 3>these people are all looking at me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking I'm just a savage,</v>

3433
02:48:26.350 --> 02:48:27.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

3434
02:48:27.371 --> 02:48:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a knuckle dragger.</v>

3435
02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:31.870
<v Speaker 3>We just need to go kill everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I tried to explain to them,</v>

3436
02:48:31.871 --> 02:48:32.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3437
02:48:34.300 --> 02:48:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost feel ashamed to say this to </v>

3438
02:48:39.971 --> 02:48:44.971
<v Speaker 3>everyone here because everyone here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>an intellectual and is very,</v>

3439
02:48:45.971 --> 02:48:49.840
<v Speaker 3>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are some problems in the world</v>

3440
02:48:50.350 --> 02:48:53.020
<v Speaker 3>that there is not an academic solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

3441
02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:58.800
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes violence is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3442
02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:01.210
<v Speaker 3>there can be a million arguments against</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3443
02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:06.550
<v Speaker 3>But the reality of it is in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you were talking about earlier</v>

3444
02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:07.680
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>

3445
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.280
<v Speaker 2>there are evil people that do evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and the only way to stop them is </v>

3446
02:49:14.821 --> 02:49:19.821
<v Speaker 2>to confront them and destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately we,</v>

3447
02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:25.220
<v Speaker 2>we are so disconnected from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it makes people look at UFC and go,</v>

3448
02:49:25.471 --> 02:49:27.180
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could that happen?</v>

3449
02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:28.930
<v Speaker 2>And it makes people look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3450
02:49:28.950 --> 02:49:30.780
<v Speaker 2>a military attack and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3451
02:49:30.781 --> 02:49:34.860
<v Speaker 2>how could that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen because we're human beings</v>

3452
02:49:35.010 --> 02:49:40.010
<v Speaker 2>and we're imperfect and there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are evil people in the world.</v>

3453
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that think there's no ever.</v>

3454
02:49:43.861 --> 02:49:46.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no excuse for a violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

3455
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Take those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring them to Ramadi right now,</v>

3456
02:49:50.221 --> 02:49:50.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3457
02:49:52.050 --> 02:49:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with evil</v>

3458
02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:56.590
<v Speaker 1>when it exists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with it?</v>

3459
02:49:56.610 --> 02:49:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you hug them?</v>

3460
02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you knock on their door with flowers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

3461
02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the solution?</v>

3462
02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:04.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't have an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an aunt.</v>

3463
02:50:04.181 --> 02:50:09.181
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why they even have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude is because they live here in </v>

3464
02:50:09.181 --> 02:50:12.421
<v Speaker 1>this sheltered environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our beautiful bubble we call the </v>

3465
02:50:12.421 --> 02:50:12.421
<v Speaker 1>United States of America</v>

3466
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:17.530
<v Speaker 2>that many brave men and women have </v>
<v Speaker 2>provided and will continue to provide </v>

3467
02:50:17.530 --> 02:50:19.100
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what is said about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
