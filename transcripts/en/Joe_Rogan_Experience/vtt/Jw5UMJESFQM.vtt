00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Australia is holding a plebiscite on whether to legalize gay marriage.</v>

3
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm against the yes campaign,</v>

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but only because it's backed by Cultural Marxists.</v>

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious to hear your views on gay marriage.</v>

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I would be against the two of it was backed by Cultural Marxists because it</v>

8
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>isn't clear to me that,</v>

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>it will satisfy the ever increasing.</v>

11
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Demand for an assault on traditional modes of being.</v>

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.771
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

14
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>with regards to gay marriage specifically,</v>

15
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a really tough one for me because,</v>

16
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine</v>

18
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything really other than spout platitudes about it.</v>

19
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I suppose unfortunately,</v>

20
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.713
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

22
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>if the marital vows are taken seriously,</v>

23
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>then it seems to me that it's a means whereby gay people could be integrated</v>

24
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>more thoroughly into standard society and that's probably a good thing.</v>

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that would decrease promiscuity,</v>

26
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>which is a public health problem.</v>

27
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>although obviously that's not limited to gay people.</v>

29
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>although gay men tend to be more promiscuous than average,</v>

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>probably because there's no women to bind them with regards to their sexual</v>

32
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:39.724
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

33
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.401
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

35
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>is that it does seem to me to be part of a wedge.</v>

36
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that legalizing gay marriage has done anything to</v>

37
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>decrease the demand that the radical left neo Marxists types are placing on</v>

38
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>traditional society.</v>

39
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>those are my views.</v>

42
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I know they're confused,</v>

43
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>because I'm in favor of extending the bounds of traditional relationships to</v>

45
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>people who wouldn't be involved in a traditional longterm relationship.</v>

46
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.931
<v Speaker 1>But I'm concerned about the undermining of traditional modes of being,</v>

47
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>including marriage,</v>

48
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

49
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>has technically and,</v>

50
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and historically been a union between a man and a woman,</v>

51
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally for the purpose of raising children in a,</v>

52
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>in a stable and,</v>

53
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

54
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 1>an optimal and stable environment.</v>

57
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.441
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

58
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>and marriage has already taken a fair bit of damage over the last few decades.</v>

59
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>poor people are increasingly less likely to be married,</v>

61
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's really not good for them as far as I'm concerned.</v>
