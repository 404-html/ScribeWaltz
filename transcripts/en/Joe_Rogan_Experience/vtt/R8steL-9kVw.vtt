00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.700
<v Speaker 1>so we're approaching like the place we're going to do the afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.871
<v Speaker 1>landing spot,</v>

5
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>which is just kind of sky deck overlooking the jungle.</v>

6
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to take my shoes off as I walked up there.</v>

7
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>So I just fucking did it.</v>

8
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I took my shoes off,</v>

9
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>didn't worry about the mosquitoes and that felt great.</v>

10
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Just feeling the grass and the mud on my feet.</v>

11
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a short walk.</v>

12
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>So there wasn't any crazy shit going on in the,</v>

13
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>in the brush or anything I had to worry about.</v>

14
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>We get up there and um,</v>

15
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I go to lie down and I had taken again,</v>

16
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd taken the most,</v>

17
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>what you might've taken at any point ever.</v>

18
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm more blasted than I had been the whole trip because I got eight ounces</v>

19
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:36.734
<v Speaker 1>instead of six.</v>

20
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And I go to lie down and I'm pondering this idea of choice a lot and fears and</v>

21
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>feeling pretty good because everything that's happened,</v>

22
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I was passed these tests and I see this little ant crawling towards me to my</v>

23
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>right hand side and I look and I go,</v>

24
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.991
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

25
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>there's an aunt coming.</v>

26
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I totally broke my train of thought.</v>

27
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Stood straight up,</v>

28
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>and then I look back at that and I just realized,</v>

29
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

30
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I just let that little fucking aunt have the power over me to make me sit up.</v>

31
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I lose my train of consciousness and completely move on his behalf.</v>

32
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like a deadly poisonous and it was just an ant and I.</v>

33
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Then I thought to myself,</v>

34
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 1>how many other these little things that are truly ants in our existence,</v>

35
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.721
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>

36
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>worries,</v>

37
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Paranoia's relationships that you feel crunchy about in this certain way or</v>

38
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>crunchy.</v>

39
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I like something that's uncomfortable to you in a situation or that you're</v>

40
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>projecting and you're simulator is worried about these little things when in</v>

41
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>reality or no more than these ants which are harmless,</v>

42
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>caused you to make,</v>

43
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>to choose actions that aren't in your best interest,</v>

44
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

46
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>because we give them power,</v>

47
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>we give them the power over us to make us move.</v>

48
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>They do have power</v>

49
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>and they could do just as good.</v>

50
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can have a show.</v>

51
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>You did it from your fucking living room 12 years ago and look at you today</v>

52
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 3>and if let's say that they somehow coopt us and we sell out,</v>

53
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

54
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 3>They'll some,</v>

55
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 3>someone else's company also replaced Alex Jones.</v>

56
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.951
<v Speaker 3>He's waiting.</v>

57
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:02.641
<v Speaker 3>He's in Austin,</v>

58
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>

59
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 3>You say you're the number one,</v>

60
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 3>but I've got the statistics.</v>

61
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I've got the documents right here,</v>

62
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 3>but show you're a liar.</v>

63
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 3>You're a new world order puppet.</v>

64
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 3>He seems like he's out there working for the people.</v>

65
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 3>He's not working for the people.</v>

66
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 3>He worked for MSNBC.</v>

67
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

68
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to Msnbc unless you sell your soul to David Ickes reptilians.</v>

69
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 3>That was awesome.</v>

70
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

71
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard you do that.</v>

72
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

73
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 3>that was amazing.</v>

74
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I've known that dude for a long time.</v>

75
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

76
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones in 1999.</v>

77
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>

78
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 2>a DVD in Austin,</v>

79
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Texas and Alex Jones and I put on Bush masks.</v>

80
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I was a Bush Jr.</v>

81
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>He was bush senior and we,</v>

82
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:44.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

84
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 2>we were these outfits and ran around the capital and it was called the live from</v>

85
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 2>the belly of the beast.</v>

86
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 2>It was rigHt before bush senior got elected.</v>

87
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.451
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

88
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:53.671
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

89
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I've known him for even before then.</v>

90
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I've known that guy for a long time.</v>

91
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>My theory is that alex is a false operation.</v>

92
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

93
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Is there a real,</v>

95
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.853
<v Speaker 3>a real theory?</v>

96
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Kind of half kidding.</v>

97
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Half serious.</v>

98
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 3>But you say that because you're trying to fuck with me.</v>

99
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 3>What he's trying to do right now is coal up my mind.</v>

100
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting here in austin,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey.</v>

103
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting fucking crazy.</v>

104
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to protect people from the government as black helicopters.</v>

105
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.990

<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

122
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember who told me this story,</v>

123
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:52.650
<v Speaker 2>but somebody opened up the drawer and they pissed on their sock drawer.</v>

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I was plastered in Ireland years ago and I went out the room door.</v>

145
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was going into.</v>

146
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I was just drunk and half awake.</v>

147
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I just needed to pee and I'm in the fucking hallway naked and I was banging on</v>

148
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 2>the door and my hand girlfriend get come.</v>

149
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing out there again?</v>

150
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Did that mother fucking door?</v>

151
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 2>We already have this on a podcast.</v>

152
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Hennigan did that right there.</v>

153
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 2>My manager and Henry Phillips both have stories walking out thinking they're</v>

154
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 2>going into the bathroom,</v>

155
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.430
<v Speaker 2>walking out naked and the door shuts me.</v>

156
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Amanda both naked in the fucking hallway going.</v>

157
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Then you instantly become john ritter.</v>

158
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:04.644
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been.</v>

159
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.061
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

160
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not comedy.</v>

161
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

162
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't have identification.</v>

163
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 2>If you do like a 20 year bid in a hotel,</v>

164
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you're working in a hotel for 20 years.</v>

165
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Some who's coming down naked.</v>

166
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640
<v Speaker 2>How many dudes come down naked during your entire career holding their cock and</v>

167
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:23.474
<v Speaker 2>balls is going?</v>

168
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

169
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>when he went into a like a locker,</v>

170
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>a housekeeping door that was open,</v>

171
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 2>grabbed a a sheet or whatever,</v>

172
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 2>put it over his dick.</v>

173
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I walked down to the hotel and they just gave him the key.</v>

174
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>

175
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They didn't say id or anything.</v>

176
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 2>Ideology is.</v>

177
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

178
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

179
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who said it,</v>

180
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

181
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it's the enemy of free thinking,</v>

182
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

183
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 2>You get in these ideological clusters and then anything outside of this thing,</v>

184
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 2>these predetermined patterns of behavior that you've done to subscribe to</v>

185
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>anything becomes forbidden.</v>

186
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>It becomes you.</v>

187
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't even entertain it.</v>

188
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't even approach the idea.</v>

189
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 2>You see it with everything you see with atheism.</v>

190
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 2>You see it with,</v>

191
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you see it with any isms,</v>

192
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 2>with feminism,</v>

193
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>with the men's rights.</v>

194
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>You see it with people who subscribe to the right people,</v>

195
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.354
<v Speaker 2>subscribed to the left.</v>

196
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Any variables that don't fit into their equation that they've already suBscribed</v>

197
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

198
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be labeled as that other side and anytime they don't want to</v>

199
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:30.720
<v Speaker 2>be labeled,</v>

200
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 2>they start ignoring any evidence or any ideas that don't fit within this really</v>

201
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 2>rigid description.</v>

202
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

203
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is.</v>

204
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.790
<v Speaker 2>You hit the nail on the head,</v>

205
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.460
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

206
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

207
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.753
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

208
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 2>People get locked into these ideological paradigms and then from that point on,</v>

209
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:54.311
<v Speaker 2>basically their perspective as modified more by emotion and rationality more by</v>

210
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 2>their feelings rather than real information.</v>

211
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.330
<v Speaker 2>You're the only person that's ever come in,</v>

212
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 2>sat down and said,</v>

213
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.971
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

214
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.511
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>

215
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a cortisol rush.</v>

216
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.541
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

217
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a cortisol rush from the feeling of about.</v>

218
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

219
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I could have gotten a little more detail,</v>

220
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 4>but please do.</v>

221
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.483
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

222
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 4>so that feeling of anxiety,</v>

223
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:17.171
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

224
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 4>that lIke you get before you go onstage,</v>

225
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

226
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.271
<v Speaker 4>you're a comedian,</v>

227
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're familiar with that.</v>

228
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.240
<v Speaker 4>You actually are expressing a chemical called dane orphan and uh,</v>

229
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 4>this is an endogenous chemical in your brain and it binds to something called</v>

230
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 4>the kappa opioid receptor.</v>

231
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 4>It's kinda like the counter of the endorphin which binds to the new opioid</v>

232
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.521
<v Speaker 4>receptor.</v>

233
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Speaker 4>So the endorphins are the feel good.</v>

234
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.951
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

235
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 4>it's nemesis is the dynorphins,</v>

236
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 4>which is that anxiety,</v>

237
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 4>like feeling.</v>

238
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.841
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

239
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:46.040
<v Speaker 4>but here's the interesting part,</v>

240
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.790
<v Speaker 4>that anxiety,</v>

241
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.570
<v Speaker 4>like feeling that you feel before you're going to do something like you're</v>

242
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.550
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

243
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 4>that you care about or that's kind of anxiety provoking for me.</v>

244
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Public speaking does it,</v>

245
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

246
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I get it right before I'm going to do it,</v>

247
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

248
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 4>give a talk or something,</v>

249
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

250
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 4>or do a podcast in front of,</v>

251
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

252
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 4>500,000 people.</v>

253
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

254
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 4>so that dynorphins binding to the cap opioid receptor.</v>

255
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:14.321
<v Speaker 4>What it does is it upregulates the mule opioid receptor so that after you get</v>

256
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 4>that anxiety feeling,</v>

257
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 4>you have a better endorphin rush because you upregulate the new opioid receptors</v>

258
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 4>which bind to the endorphins,</v>

259
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:22.694
<v Speaker 4>the feel good ones,</v>

260
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 4>and you actually become sensitized to them.</v>

261
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 4>So there's a biological mechanism by which having that anxiety actually does you</v>

262
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

263
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of like a stress at first,</v>

264
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:35.500
<v Speaker 4>but then later on you're,</v>

265
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.060
<v Speaker 4>you get,</v>

266
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 4>do you feel better and you're more relaxed.</v>
