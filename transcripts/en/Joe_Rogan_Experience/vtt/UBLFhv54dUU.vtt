WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840
No levels.
Judas Freelander wouldn't give a fuck about levels.
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.110
We here to learn how to beat up anybody.
Champ.
You know,
we're in a world champ,

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:11.100
pat.
Dude,
I didn't get a world champ shirt says it in sign language.
Oh,

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.100
you please.
FTB Yeah,

5
00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:15.390
these are actually the severed shrunk and fists of my deceased opponents melted

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.290
onto my hand.
Now,

7
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:21.090
is that a real weathered hat or did you prematurely whether it,
no,
this is,

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.320
I've been wearing this hat for two years.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,
okay.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.000
So my mom keeps saying you should retire it.
No,
no,
no.
I keep wearing it.
No,

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.710
there's,
it's vintage now.
It's classy.
It's been through battles.

11
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:32.520
It's been through war.

12
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.490
You know what you could do though for sure is you could sell those,

13
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.480
like the ones that you've worn for a long time and people would gobble it up and

14
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.030
then maybe see,
you know how like those,
uh,

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.090
you know what a humiliate tricks is.
Now,

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
there's a lot of gals out there that make a living selling their old socks and

17
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:55.470
uh,
they'll sell like a various bodily fluids and excretion.
Gotcha.

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.760
Two dudes who,
uh,
have a thing for that.
Yeah.

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.500
We had this girl Sierra Lynch on recently and she,
uh,
educated us on this,

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410
this world.
But uh,

21
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.370
so it's like vintage shopping but with a more personal touch to it.

22
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.750
I'm like how you put a spin on it,
man.
So you wrote this book,

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.650
which is how to beat up anybody.
Yeah.
That was a five years ago that came out.

24
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.770
Now it's an instructional karate book.
Nice.
Yeah.

25
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780
You actually studied this.
This book is,

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.850
it's basically a spoof of people who think they're great at it but are

27
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:34.760
horrendous at it.
It's basically,
you know,

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.400
I teach you how to beat up Ninjas and bigfoots,

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.450
but it's kind of like the worst martial arts instruction possible.

30
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.110
Um,
and it's,
it's,
it's like a 208 page photo joke book.
Basically.
I was,

31
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.570
and then,
yeah,
this is a new book just came out,
um,

32
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.420
called if the rain drops United,

33
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.850
which is a book of drunks and cartoons that I did,

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.750
mostly single panel cartoons and most of them are comedy.

35
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:02.751
But I'd say probably 40% of the ones that are comedy are kind of like dark

36
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:07.990
satire on big issues.
Whether it's like a,
yeah,
that was honest.
Tits lying ted.

37
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.090
Yeah.
That's a big issue.

38
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
That's a big issue out there and it has to do with the nipples.

39
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.110
You Went Pinocchio.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's basically a Pinocchio Story.

40
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.270
I told her nipples.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
that,

41
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:23.760
that's definitely not one of the more a social commentary,
uh,
one's in there,

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.720
but uh,
I do like that one.
That's a good one.
And I do like lying nipples also.
I,

43
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:32.070
um,
nothing wrong with them.
Yeah.
I like all night bowls.
I don't mean to,

44
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.130
I'm a fan.
I don't discriminate.
Yeah.
I've heard people say something like,
Ooh,

45
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.250
smooth new boobs are like really pale.
Ariel is just be happy.

46
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.280
You get to see him.
Yeah.

47
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.160
I think people that I think we can call that white privilege,
let's call it,

48
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.440
let's call it exactly what it is,
but it's like,
no,
whatever.

49
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.340
I hear people complaining about like,
especially like,
you know,

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.600
it's like you're already getting late.
What are you complaining about exactly.

51
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.280
You know,
it's like you can't complain about breasts.

52
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.840
Dude who's in a wheelchair used to play wheelchair.
Uh,

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.850
he used to play pool and uh,

54
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.950
he was like you playing tournaments and stuff and he was like how all these

55
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.100
physical problems,
he's like really unhealthy and uh,

56
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.050
what's his wheelchair next due to health reasons or,
okay,
Gotcha.
Yeah.

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.430
So he was,
you know,

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.730
as a physical specimen he was a mass but he was addicted to prostitutes and he

59
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.300
would only go for ones that had really well taken care of feet.

60
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.930
Okay.

61
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.930
And he had this huge issue like if someone's feet were too big or if their feet,

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.170
like he would like freak out about feet.
Like he would get like angry,
like,

63
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.710
and you want to go,
dude,
you should be happy than anybody wants to just hug you.

64
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.010
Like if you could pay a couple hundred bucks in a girl will get naked with you.

65
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.780
Like whoa.
And that's score.

66
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.590
That's also a story where you really got to like give respect to the people that

67
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:56.080
work in the sex industry.
Cause,
yeah,

68
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.330
I have a lot of respect for them because people,

69
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.340
I think what people don't understand,

70
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.030
you know what a difficult job that is.

71
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.060
And think about like the woman who goes to him and you know,

72
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:10.960
she's being paid to please him and then what does he smell like?
Yeah.
And then,

73
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.800
and then her foot's like an inch too long and he's mad.
Yeah.

74
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.500
That's,
you know,
that's,
that's,
that's,

75
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.340
that's more of a hassle than being a Barista at some coffee place or something

76
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:25.990
like that.
Way more,
way more stuff.
The sex worker thing is a real,

77
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.580
it's a real issue with our puritanical culture that we have this,
uh,

78
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:35.230
this prejudice against people that have sex with people for money.
Yeah.
We don't,

79
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.300
we don't have it with any other thing that we enjoy.

80
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.650
You don't have it with people that cook for people for money or people that give

81
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.880
massages for money or cut people's hair,

82
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.010
do a bunch of things people don't necessarily want to do.

83
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.520
I have more respect for the sex worker because if you think about it,

84
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.200
we're a capitalist society.
They're more capitalist than the rest of us.
You know,

85
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.890
they're,
they're,
well in a sense,
you know,
they're,
they're,

86
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.830
they're using their body for,
uh,
to make money.
You know,

87
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.280
what's wrong with it in a sense,
their athletes example,
they definitely are.

88
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.390
They definitely know they are,
they aren't.

89
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.720
It's kind of weird that it's still illegal though.
It really is weird.
I mean,

90
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.450
at a certain point in time it becomes stupid if it's the thing that everybody

91
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.510
wants the most.
If you,
if you across the board,

92
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.010
what do people desire more than anything at a certain time in their life,

93
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.030
it's going to be sex.
Obviously it's food and rast and shelter and you know,

94
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.720
everyone wants to have a comfortable life and good friends and all that stuff.

95
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.770
But everyone who's sexually active,

96
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:35.860
whose body works,
it's functional.
Yeah.
They want sex.

97
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.570
Even people whose bodies aren't functional,
they still want that.
Yeah.

98
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.790
And if you look at all advertising for no matter what product it is,

99
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.810
it's usually sex is the,
the,
the subtext of what they're selling.

100
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.490
So here's someone that's openly and honestly selling it.
And then you have,

101
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.420
they get discriminated against.
I think a lot of good stuff.
Yeah,

102
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.210
they got locked up.
I mean there's task forces designed to capture them.
Yeah.

103
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.670
You know,
there's,
uh,
my friend Brian Cowen,

104
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.260
I think he's told the store in the podcast before he was talking to some girl in

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:11.030
front of a,
a club and in New York,
you know,
Brian,
he's asleep.
He's a silly goose.

106
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.100
And some girls where he's like,
hey girls.
And they're like,
hey,
you want a date?

107
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.510
He's like a date.
Well,
how much would that cost?
And she's,
and,
you know,

108
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.330
and she said,
you know,
how much do you,
how much would you be willing to pay?

109
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.130
He goes,
$10,000.
He got,
he got pulled in for that.

110
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.290
They,
they let literally these women cops.
Yes,
yes.
Like he said,

111
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:37.430
$10,000 this recently,
no years ago.
I was going to say,

112
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.690
because like street hookers,
you don't really see in New York anymore,

113
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.800
but I remember like 20 years ago,
um,
you know,

114
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.480
you're just going into like the Corner Deli and girl comes up to me and she's

115
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.620
like,
hi,
you want a date?
And I was like,
you know,
for,
you know,

116
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.940
this is the first time it happened to me.
And I was like,
I'm like,

117
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.450
I'm like first of all,
what's going on?
And then you realize pretty quickly,

118
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.110
you know,
the woman's a hooker and I'm like,
Nah,
that's okay.
But thanks.
Call out.

119
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:06.500
Was she,
she was pretty hot.
So if you,
if,
if she wasn't a hooker,

120
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.950
she was just a person you thought you were attractive?
Uh,
yeah,

121
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.570
I'd probably talk to her.
Yeah.
But I'm like a Germaphobe,
so I like how,

122
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.580
like what level,
like how he Mendell level,
uh,
and he's a black belt.

123
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.000
Gold standard is different than mine.
Mine,
Mine's Kinda different.
Uh,

124
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.640
I don't know how his mentally works,

125
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:30.641
but there's different kinds of OCD and mine goes through various phases.

126
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.100
Like some people will be a neat freak because,

127
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.300
or they might lock their door five times because they're afraid they,

128
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.020
oh maybe I forgot to lock it.
And then someone's gonna break in a,

129
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:44.690
but there's another kind where if you don't lock it,

130
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.650
like doing it like the exact,
you know,
physical motions that you're supposed to,

131
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.160
then something bad's going to happen to you that day.
Like,
like,
like,

132
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.970
like you might get,
you might get cancer if you don't lock the door properly.

133
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:59.510
So that's why.
So that's why you might lock it 10 times.
It's like,

134
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.910
it's like you'll get some kind of a hex or a jinx on you.

135
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.670
That's the kind of thing that I have sporadically off and on.

136
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.490
I've had it for years,
you know,
sporadically in various.
Yeah.

137
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:10.790
Sometimes it comes and goes,
you know,
when does it,
when does it go?

138
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.650
When you're feeling great about life and everything's going well and you're

139
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.110
sometimes,
sometimes you think,
okay,

140
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:18.980
something's bad's gonna happen now because things are going well usually that

141
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:19.131
way.

142
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.920
I was thinking the other way that like when things are going well you think well

143
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.400
I don't have to worry what the heck's right now.
No,
no.

144
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.700
Usually it's when I'm not busy like cause then your mind,

145
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.080
because my mind has kind of always racing,
you know,
so if you're just,

146
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.320
if you're unable to just sit back and relax then your mind it just keeps racing

147
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.530
and then if it gets on a negative thought it just spirals and spirals and

148
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:43.190
spirals.

149
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.480
That's so common amongst comics that we were just talking about that yesterday

150
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:48.350
with Whitney Cummings.

151
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.830
She has like a kind of a similar thing where she has to constantly be active,

152
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.100
constantly be doing things and I'm the kind of the same way.

153
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.640
I'm always doing something.
Yeah.
Right,
right.
Is this like a,

154
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.210
is that a comedian thing?
Like what the hell is that?
Yeah,
I don't know.

155
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:05.211
I mean like I like sometimes when I'm exhausted and stressed out I will go out

156
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:09.150
to the comedy clubs and do two or three shows in one night and people will say,

157
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:10.440
why are you doing that?
I'm like,

158
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.110
cause it's actually the most relaxing thing I do.

159
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.020
It's like being up on stage for whatever reason.

160
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.160
That's where I'm most comfortable.
Well,
and also it's really fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.

161
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.680
And that's,
I think people forget.
It's a hell of a lot of fun.

162
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.480
I got a chance to see a tig Notaro uh,

163
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.930
Natasha Gero and Jim Jefferies last night.
What a fucking show.

164
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.700
That's awesome.
The Toro is hilarious.
So first time I've seen her live,

165
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.330
she's really fucking funny.
Where was the show at?
The improv.
Oh,
cool.

166
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.750
Jim Jefferies was fucking hilarious and all my God,

167
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:47.070
Natasha luxury Arrow killed off.
She's got this Oprah bit,

168
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:50.430
I was screaming so funny,
man.
It's so funny.

169
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:54.020
But he's like to do stand up.
It's like,
it's,
you know,

170
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.970
the being requires concentration and you have to work out and all that good

171
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.330
stuff.
But when it's,
when you've got the bits and when you're actually like,

172
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.200
you know,
in the,
you know,
you're in the zone and everything's going well.

173
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.770
It's so fun.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
People have a great time.

174
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.240
That's the most fun thing I do.
So it's what I would most like to do.

175
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.180
Yeah,
that totally makes sense.

176
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.140
I've never canceled the show cause I was tired and yeah,
the other thing is like,

177
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.440
you know,
I,
I'll feel tired when I'm leaving my house.
I go,
Oh God,

178
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:27.200
I fucking fire up.
I got to be shown an hour.
But once I get there,
I forget what,

179
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.510
when you're on stage,
it's like everything's firing up man.
It's like,

180
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.570
then when you're off,
you want to go up again.
It's such a beautiful exchange too,

181
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.480
you know?
And I particularly,

182
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:39.960
I feel that way about like Hollywood clubs because you're not really getting any

183
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.740
money.
You know,
it's not,
same with New York.
I mean,

184
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.910
in New York City you don't the,

185
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.660
those are the two cities kind of probably in the world,
you know,

186
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.490
that were in general,

187
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:54.330
when you're working in those two cities on a nightly basis where there's

188
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:56.670
multiple comics per show,
you're basically,

189
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.420
you're basically working for free or very bad money.
So you're,

190
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:03.060
you're doing it for the love of it and everyone knows and everyone's doing it

191
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:08.061
also because it's like these is fueling stations like the seller stand or the

192
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.344
store.

193
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.680
These places where you go and all the other comics were there and we all kind of

194
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:16.510
fuel fuel up,
you know?
Yeah.

195
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.320
And also comedy is something you can't practice.

196
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.530
It's not like guitar you can get at home,
stay at home.

197
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.740
They really fucking go to guitar just by playing by herself all day.
A guitar,

198
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.900
but stand up.
You have to go on stage,
otherwise you're not doing stand up.
Yeah,

199
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.190
you have to go on stage.
Also when you're working out bits,

200
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:34.920
because they take the take a life of their own up there.

201
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.270
Like I'll write a bit out and I'll have like,
Ooh,
I got a great new bit.

202
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:40.470
I can't wait to try it.
But when you're on stage,

203
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:44.060
that fucker just takes turns of its own.
I think that's because your minds,

204
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.030
at least for me,
like my mind's in hyper drive when I'm on stage,
so I might like,

205
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:51.900
I always carry around like,
you know,
little little,

206
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.230
little sheets of paper with like,
that's your sheets

207
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.080
<v 1>with like a few like words on it or something.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

208
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.660
Well these are just some random like penis faces and dude's penis is why?
No,

209
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:08.860
well that's a tongue on a dude,
but it looks like a penis guy.
But uh,

210
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.370
so,
but yeah,
so I like,

211
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.590
I'll usually have a thought or like a sentence or maybe it'll be like a one

212
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:19.180
liner and then I get on stage and then it'll,
it gets,

213
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.170
if it gets a laugh,
then I immediately,
I'm thinking art,

214
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.300
how do I extend this and take it in another direction and get another laugh,

215
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.330
you know?
Why do you,
do you have a ritual?
Like why do you write them on paper?

216
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:32.540
Why don't you put it on your phone?
Uh,
I don't know.
I'm just pending.

217
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:37.390
I'm more of a pen and paper person.
I am to remember shit like before every set,

218
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.210
I have a notebook that I bring with me everywhere.

219
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.260
When I do shows and before every set a lucky my hotel room,

220
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.670
I go have a big show that night.
I'll write out my bits.

221
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.660
Sometimes I'll write out my whole act.
I'll spend an hour.
Wow.
I usually that's,

222
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.310
that's good.
I usually,

223
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.100
this is usually me before headlining a show at like I get there right when the

224
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.080
sh like five minutes before I'm supposed to go on.

225
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.030
And then as they're saying my name,

226
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.440
I pull out a piece of paper from my pocket and go,
all right,
let's go.

227
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.310
Cause I'm trying to remember if you're the new,
a few new things.
But yeah,

228
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:17.290
I always forget stuff.
I do that too.
I mean,
but when I'm,
I feel like,
uh,

229
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.590
that the,
even though you don't have to do that sort of preparation,

230
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.650
the second front going over all the material,
when I do do that,

231
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.440
everything comes out better.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I,
I working,
you know,

232
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.800
I think you've got to work off stage and on stage,

233
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.680
but I tend to work a little like,
I don't know,

234
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:37.260
I saw that Seinfeld documentary and it seems like he works almost completely off

235
00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:38.150
stage,
you know,

236
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:41.950
like it was like his act is written and then he goes up and says it,
you know,

237
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.210
that's what it seemed like from the documentary.
Um,
but I do,
I do more writing.

238
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.840
I'm about maybe 60,
40 where you know,
well,

239
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:54.580
as far as offstage riding to onstage riding,
you know?
Yeah.
I think you need both,

240
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.180
you know,
and people that don't write off stage,
I'm always like,
God,
man,

241
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:02.210
you're missing out.
Yeah.
You have to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To get the most out.

242
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.650
How long have you doing stand up now?
Uh,
I started in 89.

243
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.870
Why did you become world champion?
That was at some point,
you know,
it's,

244
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:15.100
you know,
I'm not great at math.
That's one of my weaknesses,
but it was,
uh,

245
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.480
that was it.
You know,
I was dabbling in it in the,

246
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.030
I would say mid to late nineties but it's,
it's changed.

247
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.400
The persona has changed so much over the years.

248
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.510
It's such a weird one that we stuck with like every time I see you got a world

249
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:32.180
champion and hat on.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well it's Kinda like,

250
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.830
it's Kinda like when you get knighted,
like,
uh,
Sir Ben Kingsley.

251
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.910
It's like he's not fighting,
you know,
every day.

252
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.180
But he was still officially knighted,
so he's still got the title right.

253
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:47.470
And theoretically I'm still undefeated,
so I still got the title.
But yeah,
no.

254
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:51.100
Initially the world champion persona kind of started as when I was a kid,

255
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.830
was obsessed with a Guinness Book of World Records and I always used to try to

256
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:58.160
break them.
Like when I was eight,
I tried to break the pogo stick record.

257
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.130
I think the record was like 13 hours straight.
Oh my God.

258
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.820
And I did it for an hour straight without missing really at an hour when you're

259
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.110
eight is like a really long fucking time,
you know?
And I was,

260
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.660
I was so bored.
I was a little tired,

261
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.670
but I was so bored and I was,
I was just like,
fuck it aren't,

262
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:19.370
this is not worth breaking this road wreck.
It's amazing that it's only 13 hours.

263
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.470
I feel like that wasn't the time that was at the time,
you know,

264
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:25.220
that was in the 70s that was like in 77 this is a gang of world records that

265
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:28.660
people found out were pretty easy.
And then when it way I can do that.
Yeah.

266
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.730
And then they broke them.
I think there are,
there are,
yeah.
It's gotta be,

267
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:35.540
because probably people haven't even tried.
Like the Guinness Book is a fat book.

268
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.130
Yeah it is.
It is.
And you can like come up with a world record.
But yeah,

269
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.310
there's the group that does that where they come up with ridiculous things that

270
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:47.610
nobody else is doing.
And then,
you know,
it'd be like,
it would be like a,

271
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.610
a light rock,
you know,
I'm juggling three of these the longest she did it.

272
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:54.230
And then,
then you get a world record,
you know,

273
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.760
didn't Dane Cook was a Dane or was it a Chappelle?

274
00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.930
Who did the world record for the longest show?

275
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.740
I think they both had it at various times and then one of them broke the other

276
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.620
shore who fell broke the Danes.

277
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.160
I think someone else that no one's ever heard of did like 28 hours.

278
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.170
I think it was Tommy Tiernan in Ireland.

279
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.550
Was they key to 28 hours straight or something like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like okay.

280
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.530
Yeah.
It's like fucking who wants to break that?

281
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:21.480
Who's watching that show and who wants to break that?
Yeah.

282
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.760
This is what does it mean?
Who wants to stay up for 28 hours straight?
Yeah.

283
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:28.580
This a weird world records man.
It's like,

284
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.830
what is it about world wreck?

285
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:35.180
Like I remember I wrote this article once about this guy who is world record was

286
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:37.790
he had the longest finger nails ever.
I remember that guy.

287
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:39.650
He was in all the books when I was a kid and his,

288
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:44.420
their curl up and that guy has massive nerve damage in his shoulder and has a

289
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:48.080
hand that he cannot use for any,
can't use for anything,
can wipe his ass,

290
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:52.340
can't save his life.
Yeah.
And because it's heavy,
it's fucked up.

291
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:55.940
His nervous system.
Yeah.
I think he's bought his body's in balance.

292
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.880
It's like carrying a brick everywhere you go.
Yeah.

293
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.810
A brick made out of fingernails.
Yeah.
So I was obsessed with those things.

294
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.980
And then I uh,

295
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.430
so I think somewhere in like the early nineties or mid in the mid nineties,

296
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:08.870
I was like,
uh,

297
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.230
I started writing all these jokes about breaking all these ridiculous rolled

298
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.050
records and my act was always very joke heavy,
you know,

299
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.960
a lot of one liners and it was always very,
uh,
you know,

300
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:19.910
always did a lot of crowd work.
Uh,

301
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and then I started making my own hat somewhere in the mid nineties.

302
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.860
And I first made one that said record breaker.

303
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.310
And then I thought it would be funny to make a hat that said world champion,

304
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:32.450
but not of what,
like who is this idiot wearing a hat that says world champion.

305
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:37.190
It doesn't even say what it is.
This is just the moron bragging kind of guy.

306
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.353
And that would also,

307
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.420
and it was also good because then it would lower the audience and to ask me

308
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.790
questions and I love doing crowd work.

309
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.700
So it kind of worked and it fed into these these like world record,

310
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.920
these ridiculous athletic achievement jokes that was doing at the time.

311
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.300
And then at some point it sort of morphed and it became not a guy who was

312
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:55.020
bragging.

313
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.020
It became like an actual real life superhero who really is this amazing athlete

314
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.600
and sexual creature that is just better than everyone.

315
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.690
And he's actually just humbly stating how amazing he is.
You know,

316
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.940
he'd talk about fucking Louis Lane,
you know,
in,

317
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.980
in front of Superman without him knowing it.
Yeah.

318
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.280
Those Louis Louis Lane,
it was a,
that's actually her real name.
She was,

319
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:18.090
she's transgender.

320
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.330
A lot of people know that the comics because of bigotry at that time never

321
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:24.450
addressed it.
The glossed over it.
Yeah,
they did.
Yeah,
they sure did.
Wow.

322
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.710
How rude of them wrong.
Yeah.
Lois is a weird name for a check.

323
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.610
I don't know any lotuses.
She might be the only lowest ever.
Yeah.

324
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.820
I don't know any lowest.
So that,
yeah.

325
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:39.480
So then the world champion kind of became this and that's what this karate book

326
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:41.460
is.
It's just the,
the real life,

327
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.490
greatest martial artist and athlete ever to walk the planet and who's doesn't

328
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.110
Brag but as just so incredible.

329
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.380
And then the past few years it's morphed some more were the world champion is,

330
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.090
I mean,
he still has that,
you know,

331
00:18:57.091 --> 00:18:59.670
that is still is the greatest athlete and stuff,

332
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.740
but it may not be talking about that,

333
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.910
but he's become a person who is a champion of the world and for the rights of

334
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.750
the people of the world.
So,
so recently,
like the past,

335
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:14.340
I started doing shows in Europe about four years ago and,
uh,

336
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.390
it really kind of opened up my mind,
uh,
and my point of view,

337
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.350
because you know,
when you're in a bad relationship,
like you can't see it,

338
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.350
but all your friends can see it cause you're like too close.

339
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.680
But then if you step out,
then you can,
like a couple years later you're like,

340
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:33.420
what the fuck was I doing?
You know?
Um,
so when I started performing shows,

341
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:36.300
like in England and other countries in Europe,
I initially thought,
oh,

342
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:39.120
I'm going to be learning a lot about these countries.
And I did that.

343
00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:42.630
But what I really started learning about a lot was my own country because you

344
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.700
were able to see how other people live,

345
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.660
step away from the way you've been living and physically be farther away.

346
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.830
So I started sort of just started seeing some of the hypocrisy sees and the

347
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:57.480
ridiculousness of,
you know,
just the culture and the laws that we have,

348
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:01.280
the bullshit with the government.
And so I started,
uh,

349
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.130
talking more about,
you know,
the past few years,
bigger issues,
whether it's,

350
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.110
you know,
classism,
racism,
you know,
different kinds of things.
So,
and I try to,

351
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.270
I still try to,
you know,

352
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.640
do it from the same ridiculous and absurd angles that my act is always kind of

353
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:20.700
been.
Um,
but now with,
uh,
you know,

354
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:24.540
dealing with like big issues like that because I've always liked doing like
dark,

355
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:27.220
twisted,
crazy shit,
you know,
in,

356
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.410
in my material and finding laughs in dark places.

357
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.460
Um,
and so now with like if I do,

358
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.380
if I'm doing bits about racism,

359
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.190
I love it because I love how uncomfortable the audience gets.

360
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.850
Like if I'm doing bits about,
uh,

361
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.440
like have one bit about terminology about black people,

362
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.730
should it called blacks that we called African American.

363
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.250
You should see like usually the black people were,

364
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.590
they're a little uncomfortable at first,
but then they're fine.

365
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.850
The white people are almost always terrified to be even discussing this.

366
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.120
And that's where I like to,
I like to get comedy out of those situations.

367
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:04.120
You know,
I've never been the guy who likes to get it out of the easy spot.

368
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.850
I like going to the where it's difficult.
Uh,

369
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.690
so I've been doing more stuff like that and I also like doing it for everyone.

370
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.110
I Know Democrats,
Republicans,
because I don't find that interesting.

371
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.090
Like if you're preaching to the choir,

372
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.220
I never find that interesting or challenging.

373
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.190
I like doing a bit about gun,

374
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.250
about guns and there's people on the right and the left and they're all laughing

375
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.830
at the shit.
That's what I liked doing and trying to do.
You know?
So,

376
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.940
so there's like a conch,

377
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.170
a conscious effort you have when you're crafting your jokes to sort of like a,

378
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.200
or is it just like what you'd normally just sort of gravitate towards?

379
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.970
These are things that normally gravitate towards,

380
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:44.971
but I try to do it so that I tried to point out the absurdity in it and to sort

381
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.540
of like get people to laugh at something.

382
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.560
And then the realizing while the fact that we are arguing over this is really

383
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:57.700
absurd,
you know,
and,
and so,
so that they're going to laugh at it no matter what.

384
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.840
You know what their point of view is on an issue like,
like,
like say gun control,

385
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.110
you know,
gun control.
Cause most people,
because both sides,

386
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.880
they want the same thing.
You know,
they want peace,
they want safety.

387
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.610
Whether you're four guns are against guns,
they both want that.

388
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.410
So they have something in common but they're so passionate about,
you know,

389
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:18.280
we want our guns.

390
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.250
We don't want the guns that they don't actually see that they actually have a

391
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.050
more common ground than they think.
Right.
I mean,

392
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:27.280
that's not what I preached in my act.
But you know,
I take that you know,

393
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:30.340
that knowledge beforehand that these people actually agree more than they

394
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:34.420
disagree.
You know,
it's how they go about solving the issue that they disagree.

395
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:34.541
Well,

396
00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:38.830
I think when we set up two opposing camps like the right and the Left Democrats

397
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:40.920
or Republicans,
you know,
you,

398
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.930
you almost always have these artificial barriers that are like set up in place

399
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:49.930
for people reaching common ground.
They're all,
or they're already in place.

400
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.290
It's already a black and white.
It's all really good guys versus bad guys.

401
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.340
No matter what side you're f times their ideas and you have to oppose them if

402
00:22:57.341 --> 00:23:01.380
you're on the right,
if that makes sense.
Yeah.
What,
what I think has gotten,

403
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.800
and I think this has gotten worse,
and I think some of it is due to the Internet,

404
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.250
uh,

405
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.630
which we were talking about a little bit before the podcast started where it's

406
00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:15.150
like,
it's like nuances like gone.
It's like,
like even on the Internet,

407
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.290
on Twitter,
if you say one thing,

408
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.040
if you do one tweet and one person or one group gets offended,

409
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.330
you are demonized forever.
It's like you can't,
uh,
it's like,
you'll,

410
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:30.670
you'll never be the same.
You know,
like they're,
they're done with you.

411
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:31.600
It's almost like,
you know,

412
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:35.350
like when a five year old kid eats Broccoli for the first time and he just goes,

413
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:37.150
yeah,
and then spits it out.
Right.
It's like,

414
00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:39.880
that's the way adults are now on like every big issue.
Right?

415
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:43.020
So you write a tweet about something that's who you are.
Yeah.
That's like,

416
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.980
it's like there's no room discussion.
It's

417
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.810
<v 0>like you're evil.
Uh,
you have to go well,
it's also the,
just the,</v>

418
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.900
taking someone and judging them based on a tweet is so precarious because you're

419
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:58.340
dealing with 140 characters.

420
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:03.200
You have a limit of 140 characters and you know,
a lot of times,

421
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:05.320
especially if it's a joke,
you know,

422
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:10.280
like there's so much more that you could say about that subject.
Yeah.

423
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.150
They would give it like it would sort of fill it all in.
Yeah.
I go,

424
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:16.890
here's Jude is actual perspective wryness right.

425
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.900
But instead they take 70 characters that you thought would be kind of funny to

426
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:25.720
put out a piece of shit.
How dare you say that about blank.
You know,

427
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:31.060
and the fact that people come to a judgment about someone's entire being

428
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.380
immediately and then don't even want to discuss things.
It's like,

429
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.780
it's like you can't progress if you can't discuss things.

430
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:43.220
Well I think you're dealing with where you're calling progressive's people that

431
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:46.770
call himself many most many people on the left or,

432
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.550
or when we're using labels again for lack of a better term,

433
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.230
are more fascist than people on the right.
Do you all feel more regressed?

434
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:58.490
Fascism can come from both sides,
you know,
and with freedom of speech,

435
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.960
uh,
people can,
and I'm,

436
00:25:00.961 --> 00:25:05.150
I'm someone who's for human rights 100% and always standing up for the underdog.

437
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.360
There's actually a cartoon.
So the term fascist,
I used to think this too,

438
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:11.360
but I think the term fascist actually deals with conservative issues.

439
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.610
I think I'm pretty sure like Jamie pull up the,
the definition of fascist.
Yeah,

440
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:19.010
I'm forgetting it cause I've looked it up cause we're to use it.

441
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.640
I think people use it incorrectly because they just assume it's like,

442
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.560
but I have this one uh,

443
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.880
cartoon here in the book and it's at a college campus and it says smoking

444
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:33.950
awareness week and the right do you have a good long,

445
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.180
which is white and a bad lung,
which is black.
And underneath they say,
ah,

446
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:42.530
this poster's racist.
Then she goes,
let's protest.
That's like the bad lung,

447
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:47.420
which is black is not bad because of anything to do with like the color.

448
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:52.421
It's because a black lung is a polluted lung that is not healthy.

449
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.090
I understand.
But I'm saying,
but so some people,
I'm saying some people,

450
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.260
their heart's in the right place,
right?
They're misguided.
Yes.

451
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.540
So that's what that,
you know,
here we go.

452
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:06.520
Fascists governmental system led by a dictator having races.

453
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.860
I've seen more than one definition.
That's interesting.

454
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.130
I've seen a different definition.
Look at Webster's definition.

455
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.620
What do they say?
Well,
we're going to start a government ruled by a dictator.

456
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.910
It's cause as to do to emphasizing aggression now,

457
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.660
but I've seen it,
I've seen it.
Written definition.

458
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.820
Let's see a political philosophy.
Mm.

459
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.990
Centralize.
Autocratic government headed by a dictator.
Dictatorial.

460
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.190
That's a weird word.
Dictatorial leadership.
Right.

461
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.200
But see some of it is social regimentation certain philosophy that that is

462
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:48.640
forced upon people,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
So that is fascist then.
Yeah.
Yeah.

463
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.310
I just think there's so much with culture now.
There's such this,
there's uh,

464
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.160
there's the nodding,

465
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.500
the concept of discussing something and also when you talk to people who,

466
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.890
who disagree with you on something,
that's when you can really learn,
you know,

467
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:05.520
about their point of view and your point of view.
You know,
you both can learn.

468
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.030
I think also we're dealing with is there's a lot of people now that were

469
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:12.420
marginalized before and didn't have a viewpoint maybe in high school and then,

470
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:16.050
right.
And maybe even in college and now because of the Internet,

471
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.610
they've found like minded people,

472
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:21.690
they band together and then really becomes sort of thought bullies.
Yeah,
yeah,

473
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.950
yeah.
I that people,
it's not about like you just said something wrong.

474
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:29.700
It's like you now have to be shamed for it instead of like,
you know,

475
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.170
if someone says something,

476
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:36.030
you know that even even if someone ever says anything to me about something,

477
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:40.020
it's like I want to discuss it and find out why they're feeling that way.

478
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.160
And then,
uh,
if I still think differently,
explained my,

479
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.700
my point of view to them so that they can see it.
But yeah,
I don't know.

480
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.940
People just,
it's like they just want to fight.
They just want to shame and fight.

481
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.890
They want to attack because they're afraid of being attacked themselves at

482
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.150
first.
That's a lot of what's going on in part of what I teach in my book,

483
00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:04.800
how to be a better buddy is self offense.
Do you teach that first ask questions?

484
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.660
Never.
Yeah.
Shame first.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Shame.
No shame them to death.
Maybe not.

485
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:13.000
I don't do that.
I don't shame people.
No,
no,
I'm not into that.
She,

486
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.410
maybe that's what your new persona,
when you morph again,
oh,

487
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.540
that's going to be a shamer that's insured.

488
00:28:19.541 --> 00:28:23.510
You start shaming people for shit that's not even shameful.
Yeah,
I like that.
So.

489
00:28:23.511 --> 00:28:23.641
Well,

490
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:27.030
I actually had recently a little bit of my act that did that a little bit where

491
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:29.640
I'm sort of making fun of it.
Like as soon as when people start clapping,

492
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:33.750
I'm like,
guys,
just stop that.
That's actually offensive to people without hands.

493
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.150
And then I'll say,
uh,
I said,
uh,
I,

494
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.080
I'd like to apologize for wearing a hat that's offensive to our friends in the

495
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.940
headless community.
You know,
just making fun of the people who are like way too.

496
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.150
I had this woman Christina Summers on who's a feminist and a,

497
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.750
she calls herself the factual feminist and she kind of fights against a lot of

498
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.990
ridiculous ideology that's going around the what?

499
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:58.440
The quote unquote feminist community where they're spouting false statistics and

500
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:01.740
fake fake studies or studies that are not real or

501
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.790
there's many different factions and uh,
fuck Rifra was sorry about it.

502
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:13.170
That's okay.
It'll come back to it.
Did you just say before that,

503
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:15.070
what were you just saying?
Uh,

504
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.000
we're talking about there's many different factions of fans on that was before

505
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.610
that shit.
Uh,
I was talking about the headless community.
Look,

506
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:25.930
we're not offending them.
Oh,
clapping.
That's what it was.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
Um,

507
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.380
she was saying that I'm a fight not for cold.

508
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:33.030
I think it brings on some hot today.
I ain't going around with everybody.
It is,

509
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:35.460
everyone's got some kind of a weird sort of cold.

510
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.460
She was saying that she does these shows and uh,
the where they were,
you know,

511
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.150
people give speeches and they don't want people clapping because the think

512
00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:49.990
clapping will trigger people that have been beaten before.
So like hearing this,

513
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:54.910
yeah,
we'll trigger the idea of you be ready.
So they all have,
they do jazz hands,

514
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.300
right?
Snap,
snap,
nick or I read about the snapping thing.

515
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.000
Justin says,
and you know,
the original,
I think when the beatniks in the 60s,

516
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:05.590
in New York,
he used to do the snapping.

517
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.980
That was because they were having illegal shows and if they all applauded that

518
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:13.510
would the neighbor people who lived,

519
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.780
you know on the upstairs or the next door would hear,
they applaud.

520
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.250
Then they'd call the cops and shut them down.

521
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.110
So they did the snapping because it was quieter than cap than clapping and that

522
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:27.050
way they can still show like that,
you know,
appreciation.
Appreciation.
Yeah.

523
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.880
So that was the initial thing where the beatniks did it does it real?
I think so.

524
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:32.830
It's because they had illegal speakeasies where,

525
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.380
where there like after our shows going on and shit,

526
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.220
my mom used to have this really cool lamp in her house that was made with like

527
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:44.221
lead and stain glass and it was from an original speakeasy from the prohibition.

528
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.150
Oh Wow.
Cool.
What the fuck she did with that thing?
It was so awesome.

529
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:53.530
That's awesome.
That's cool.
I don't know if she sold it or got rid of it or what.

530
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.880
God dammit.
I wish I had that though cause she had it restored and put together.

531
00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:01.570
I mean it's like a lamp from like 1921 or something like that.
Where,

532
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.340
where is she?
Where like,
um,
my mom lives in Mexico now.
Oh Wow.

533
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.440
And my mom,
my Stepdad,
they live in Mexico,

534
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.370
like found like this strange community of ex pats in Mexico.

535
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.430
A lot of people moved to Mexico and they get a little bit,

536
00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:18.870
Jesse Ventura is going to police down there.
Yeah,
he lives in Mexico.
He's,

537
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.200
I want to go weird fucking,

538
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.050
I want to get to know Mexico cause I really don't know it that well at all.

539
00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.670
Mexico is awesome.
I love men here.
Mexico City is just amazing.
It's very cool.

540
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.890
And they have a lot of good filmmakers coming out of there now,

541
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.920
but the pollution is staggering.
Really?
Yeah.

542
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:37.840
I took photos of it and put it up on my Instagram and a CV.
You find one of us,

543
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.790
you can't even believe it.
It doesn't even look real.

544
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:41.470
It looks like you're flying into a fire.

545
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.120
Why have friends like from Beijing in China and like,
Ooh,
that's even worse.

546
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.970
It's just insane.
I think that's the worst in the world.
China has,
but it,

547
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.520
Mexico City was so bad.
I was getting headaches there and you smell it,

548
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.420
you smell it when you land,
you're like Whoa,
like the Po.

549
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.690
And apparently they say the pollution is way better now than it was a decade
ago,

550
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.160
which is very hard to believe.
Wow.
Traffic there is also insane.

551
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.960
The traffic lights are a fucking joke and it's a free for all.
Right.

552
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.020
And trying to merge like look at that.
That's flying in.
That's Masco setting.

553
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:18.980
Yeah.
Like that cloud.
Yeah.
Shit that's,
I can't,

554
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.190
I was driving here,
I just read some,

555
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:25.810
I just heard it on the radio in porter ranch.
There's some kind of gas leak.

556
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they just got this camera,
uh,

557
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.140
the special camera that can like see gas and it's like they like the,
the,

558
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.340
the governor of the authorities said no,
it's not leaking.

559
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.010
And someone got this special camera that can like see gas and is still going

560
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.600
<v 2>everywhere in porter ranch and 700 and 700 families have moved out and they're</v>

561
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:47.780
like trying to like fight the government sued the government or that plant or

562
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.750
whatever that's doing it.
Yeah.
Oh good.
Cause I'm like,

563
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.250
that's not that far from here.

564
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.540
New Infrared video shows possible gas cloud lingering above.

565
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.420
Oh whoa.
Yeah,
and it's still like leaking like crazy and I'm like what the fuck?

566
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.650
That's the gas.
Yeah.
That's what the special cameras,
Shit that's going on now.

567
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:11.651
They had a big meeting last night and they said 700 families have moved out on

568
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:14.510
their own,
but the government and tell them to their like they were like,
fuck it,

569
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:17.840
we don't trust you guys were moving a lot of good for them.
If they've got it,

570
00:33:17.841 --> 00:33:21.050
that is the last person you should ever listen to.
This very close to here.

571
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:22.300
That's the only like five or six miles.

572
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:26.240
I'm like that gas can't be just going to porter ranch.
It's not like it knows.

573
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.920
It's probably going right to Jamie's head.
Yeah,
yeah.
This is this fucked.

574
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:35.921
But that the government is all about trying to minimalize the impact on the

575
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.750
economy in these areas.
People are breathing,

576
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:45.090
they're not dropping dead on this.
Capitalism wins.
You know,

577
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.280
what is this lady doing with a mask on and sunglasses?
That pitch is one least.

578
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:54.140
She let the gas out herself.
She did it.
Yeah.
That's what she's done.
She's like,

579
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.530
she's like a bad guy that shows up at the scene of the crime.
Look at her.
Yeah.

580
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.620
I don't know how this gas got out,
but we got to get outta here.

581
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.720
Meanwhile she's got a monkey wrench.

582
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:07.721
Your back pocket unscrewing the gas gas leak controversy at Porter ranch.

583
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not good.
No.

584
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.750
You know what else isn't good?

585
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.850
There was something I wanted to talk about today because it was so fucking

586
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:18.950
ridiculous.
I tweeted it earlier today,

587
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.280
there's this man who is a 52 year old father who identifies as a 16 as a six

588
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:27.670
year old girl.
And uh,
it's,

589
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.620
it's hilarious because I tweeted it and it's a story about this a,

590
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.190
he's Canadian and this guy who identifies as a six year old girl.

591
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.350
Okay.
And like this is a tough thing.

592
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.080
So He dresses up like a six year old and acts like a six year old.
Yes.

593
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:46.340
That's what he identifies as he identifies as,
and this sort of,

594
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.430
you know,
people don't want to admit this,

595
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.020
but this sort of is what's going on with a lot of folks when it comes to this

596
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:55.190
whole transgender thing.

597
00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.020
The idea that you identify with something like being normal and healthy,

598
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:04.900
and this is the extreme of that.
You're right now do,

599
00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:09.350
you cannot look at that and not think that guy is out of his fucking mind.

600
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.880
But when I tweeted it,

601
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.020
then I watch all the other people that are commenting on and online and there's

602
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:18.500
people that are very supportive of the transgender community and very supportive

603
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:20.180
of transgender rights and they,

604
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.800
they've hit this wall of ridiculousness.

605
00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:28.670
Like w how do you respond to this now,
do you say,
okay,
that's enough.
Well,

606
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:31.220
if that's enough,
is that enough?
Well,
with,
well,

607
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:34.550
what did we do about Bruce Jenner?
You know,
how do you,
what do you,

608
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.870
what do you say about this guy?

609
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:38.130
What do you say about that guy who wants to be a woman or this

610
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.990
<v 0>guy who thinks he's a fox or this guy who,
you know,
I'm a raccoon kin.</v>

611
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.800
I mean people are out of their fucking mind and that's something we're going to

612
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:50.760
have to come to grips with in this,
this,
this and that stuff going to be on.

613
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:54.250
And you're trying to be progressive and we're trying to be as,

614
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.510
as open minded and accepting of diversity as possible.

615
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.240
You're going to deal with this.
I think this is awesome.

616
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:05.100
I think you should go back to kindergarten.
This is kindergarten.
First grade.

617
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:09.450
Yeah.
Yeah.
Seven.
Yeah.
I wonder what the girl wants.
How old,

618
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:15.340
how old were you?
You Fuck?
No,
she was like 25.
26.
That's a woman have,

619
00:36:15.341 --> 00:36:19.380
you know,
so I went to with her but I think she had,
we went over a short time.

620
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:23.970
We don't for like a few weeks we dated,
but she had maybe more,
uh,

621
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.360
I think she had split personality disorder.

622
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.930
Was that cause sometimes she was completely normal and then sometimes she,

623
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:40.010
it was like she had no vocabulary and would speak in broken English and like I

624
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.820
bet you'd be talking about something.
I'll be like,
yeah,

625
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:45.930
I saw the thing on CNN and then she'd go,
what?
CNN?
I'm like,

626
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.130
well you have to know what CNN is.
You don't,
you're,

627
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.670
you grew up in New York City and you don't know what CNN is.

628
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.890
And then another point like,
uh,

629
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.800
we're talking about was talking about the New York jets game and she's like,

630
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:03.030
what are the jets?
And I'm like,
how do you,
you,
you grew up here in New York.

631
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:05.040
How do you not know?
Even if you don't watch football,

632
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:07.320
you know you're going to see an ad.
Oh that's,
you know,

633
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:10.440
on a blush that's driving by or something sex with this girl.
No I didn't.

634
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.410
I did it you.
And now it's all so at some point.

635
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:17.400
And then at one point we're sitting in my car and she's talking normal like

636
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.270
queens accent.

637
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:21.810
And then she starts talking all of a sudden like in like broken English,
like,
hi,

638
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.160
how are you?
Oh,
okay.
And I'm like,
what?
You know?

639
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.020
And then at for a second she goes,
come on,
get it together and get it together.

640
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:30.740
I'm like,
she said that to herself.
Yeah,
yeah.
To herself,
you know.

641
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.810
You know she's like talking to herself.
She's crazy.
Yeah.
And then,

642
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.050
and then she wanted to make a commitment like,
like,
like,

643
00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:41.340
like let's get serious about what,
about dating,
like being a couple.

644
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.800
But she wanted,
but she had something,
but she said to me,

645
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:45.840
she had something really serious,
she needs to tell me,

646
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.400
but she can't say it until after I say to her that I want to be in a committed

647
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.520
relationship with her.
Just the two of you.
Okay.
So I'm like,
no,

648
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:58.040
that's the kind of Shit you put out before,
you know,
she's got her own wells.

649
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.170
So I noticed like when she would start changing her voice,

650
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:04.530
talking about broken English,
it was almost like her vocabulary got worse too.

651
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.070
So I actually think she had split personality disorder where one was like,

652
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.480
she was like a little girl.
Was she hot issue.
Very good luck.
Shit.
Fuck it.

653
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:13.330
Who Cares?
Yeah.

654
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.410
But they don't worry about it but to go but interesting as people whose brains

655
00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:22.080
don't work so good.
Yeah.
Just like some people have club foot,
right.

656
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.040
Some people have shitty brains.
Alright.
Right.
Club brain.
Yeah,
for sure.

657
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.990
Cleft palate.
Yeah.
Fucked up brain is just,
yeah.
Defects.

658
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.010
Dude.
I love your,
I just want to say I love the uh,
the Werewolf in London

659
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.040
<v 2>Werewolf.
He got out pretty dope,
Huh?
Yeah,</v>

660
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.890
that was a great shout out to Pat Mcgee,
this guy named Pat Mcgee.

661
00:38:40.891 --> 00:38:45.690
He does a special effects for films makeup,
so that's an incredible job.

662
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:50.440
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
As a mold.
He makes him for anybody who wants one can get one.

663
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.250
Okay.
He does a Yeti too,
is a big giant Yeti.
Cool.
He does the alien from,

664
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.240
I'm going to look him up cause I,
that's,
that's a really good,
yeah,

665
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:00.400
he's really good.
And that was a great movie.
Well,

666
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:05.260
he's one of those guys that believes in makeup special effects as opposed to
CGI.

667
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.490
I did this.
I was into that when I was a little kid.
Me Too.
Real too.
Yeah,
yeah,

668
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:12.200
yeah.
It was to Rick Baker and wanting to do that for the movies.
So yeah,

669
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.360
after I saw star wars,
like the continuum,
the Cantina scene.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cantina,

670
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.750
Cantina and Tina's.
Yeah.
Uh,
I remember saying thinking,
wow.

671
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.110
Like that was all bunch of masks.
But meanwhile,
if you watch that today,

672
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:27.140
it looks so stupid.
The masks are so obviously mass,
right.

673
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:32.200
They're just rubber frozen like blue people.
Well,
the movie did.
Yeah.

674
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:33.900
The special effects,
the radical movement.

675
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.840
I think the spaceship stuff is still great in that movie.
Oh,

676
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:37.690
it's fucking terrible.

677
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.780
I guess I can't see it because I watched it.
I just love it.
Well,

678
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.690
you know what I watched this morning?
I watched it with my kid.
I watched,
um,

679
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.640
the planet of the apes from 2001.
Was that the Marky mark?
Yeah.

680
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.330
I didn't like,
that was terrible.
I didn't like that at all.
But it was walking,

681
00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.270
watching the special effects.
I'm like,
wow,
just 14 years ago,

682
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.480
special effects look like shit.
Yeah,
they look so fake.

683
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:05.650
But at the time we were like,
Whoa,
that's finally they got it right.

684
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:10.600
Space for sure.
You know that suspension of disbelief was uh,
yeah,

685
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.800
but now I mean like,
you know,
interstellar or something like that.
It's like wow,

686
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.980
they've got it.
I don't know.
Sometimes when I see stuff now,

687
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:21.910
I still like the superhero movies.
It'll be like,
okay,

688
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:26.440
here's Robert Downey jr talking to mark Ruffalo and then they put on their

689
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:29.350
superhero costumes and then it's like watching a cartoon.

690
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.840
I never feel like it's Robert Downey jr in that suit when he's flying around and

691
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:36.640
punching shit.
Yeah.
That's what they have to do.

692
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:40.570
The cutaway to his face with all the lights on it cause he's got the mask.
Right.

693
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.040
I still,
I just,
I kind of lose believability with that stuff.

694
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.540
I sat down with my kids the other day and we watched King Kong,

695
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.460
the 1933 version of say Rod.
Yeah,
great movie.

696
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.320
It was,
it's incredible to watch what a difference movies are like what,

697
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:03.350
what difference it is between the 1933 movie and a 2015 yeah,

698
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.580
I even liked the 1976 one with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange.

699
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.150
Well we watched the 2005 version as well.
I went back to back,
oh yeah,

700
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.920
33 to 2005.

701
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.850
I just showed them the King Kong scenes just so they could see the difference.

702
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.400
Right.
Oh that's so cool.
You're educating them and special effects.
Well,
yeah.

703
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:25.540
Well we were watching this,
what it was,
you know,
a,
I have a TV in my car,

704
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.560
excuse me.
And we were watching a monster sink and monster zincs.

705
00:41:30.561 --> 00:41:33.800
There was a place that we're going called Harry housings and Harry housing is

706
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:34.730
Ray Harryhausen

707
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.920
<v 0>who a famous special effects guy.</v>

708
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:39.470
It was like a shout out in the movie to Ray Harryhausen.

709
00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:43.820
Cause obviously monster's inc was an animated movie.
Right.
And so,
uh,

710
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:46.400
I was explaining to them who ray Harryhausen was and I said,
well,

711
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:49.880
I'm going to show you guys some old school animation so I can get a chance to

712
00:41:49.881 --> 00:41:50.540
look at it.
Right.

713
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.950
And so I played them King Kong and they were fucking howling laughing.

714
00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.140
They thought it was so stupid.
They were like,
oh my God.
There it is.

715
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.300
But see,
you got to get a video of it.

716
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:06.170
Pull Pacira you'll pull a video of the first time.
Yeah,
he can calm seas.

717
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:11.230
Fay Wray was the King of stop motion animation and yeah,

718
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.240
he did King Kong.
He did us from those Sinbad movies and uh,

719
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.590
it was so yeah,
she did the,
I think one of the last ones are,

720
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:26.120
last one he did was clash of the titans in [inaudible] 81 stupid.

721
00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:30.260
It least got the strobing and it's obvious that they're not in the same plane,

722
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.410
you know,
like him,
him and her,
they're not in the same place.
Like,

723
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.040
and then they had the head,
there was the big head that wasn't the same thing.

724
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:38.900
It wasn't a claymation animation.

725
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:42.800
It was like a big mechanized face where the mouth open and shut and then they

726
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:47.630
went to this thing like,
look,
I'll fake it looks,
Oh I,

727
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.810
I just sort of ignored it and I still get into it though.

728
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:55.730
Look how good the lighting is,
man.
But for 1933,
this was amazing.

729
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.400
Like people couldn't believe it.
Like,
see,
they would go to this,

730
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.270
this was the machine at the mouth.
We just open and close and then favor.

731
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:06.380
He was screaming and yelling and even the style of acting they did was so

732
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:10.700
different the way you talk then.
Well,
what kind of a film are we gonna make it,

733
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:11.001
you know,

734
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.690
it was like the opposite of a lot of acting you see in like American indie films

735
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.380
now we're almost like,
people have no energy and it's like they have no acting.

736
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:21.770
They're just,
everyone's just walking around with a blank face here.

737
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.740
They really overt did it.
They've put a lot of energy into it.
Well,

738
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:27.980
I think that was reminiscent,
or w was,
uh,

739
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.510
an aftereffect rather of doing things on stage with no fee when no microphones.

740
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.040
Interesting.
Because when they,

741
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.860
when they used to have no microphones used to have to project,
right.

742
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.850
So you would have to talk like that,
right to the back of the room,

743
00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:44.150
could hear you right.
And be more physical with your emotions and stuff.

744
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.880
That makes sense.
And so 1933 you got to think,

745
00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:49.910
well they've only been doing movies for a couple of decades back then.

746
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.570
Especially movies where people got to Todd even not even really when was the

747
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:58.470
first silent movie or think of the Teens silent?
I think in the teens.

748
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.990
I think it was the 18 hundreds yeah,
I feel like 1800 was the first silent movie.

749
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.710
But talkies came in the twenties I think,
or something like diarrhea.

750
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.110
So 1933 it was all really,

751
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:12.560
really knew when they were 1891 wow.

752
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.850
And so 1927 when the first talkie.
So that's incredible.

753
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:19.440
So it talking about six years,
six,

754
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.800
six years of talkies before King Kong came out.
So they really didn't have it.

755
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:28.310
I mean that's like a 2011 movie.
I mean think about that.
What did that be cool?

756
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:32.430
I think it would be so cool to go back in time and to try to be like an actor in

757
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:36.610
those times and like being the silent movies and then crush it and then get in

758
00:44:36.611 --> 00:44:38.850
talkies.
I mean you would know so much,

759
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.100
you would go back in time and you would think of you.
It's just like,

760
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.820
this is genius.
Oh,
I didn't think of it that way.

761
00:44:43.821 --> 00:44:45.840
I asked about actually just living back then,

762
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.690
like if you were born back then back then.

763
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.660
I wonder how much of a representation,
how much,

764
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:56.370
how accurate the representation of people were in those films as to like what

765
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:58.500
they were really like in real life.
Oh yeah.

766
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.910
I know it's hard when you see people talking like that,
say Mr,

767
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.110
who are you?
Yeah.
You don't get a sense of what they were really were like,
yeah,

768
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:11.510
that's might have been,
I think they were pretty savage.
Yeah.
I don't think,

769
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.830
I dunno.
I think if you look at,

770
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:19.610
there's a bunch of stuff that happens in those movies that you don't see today,

771
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.710
like in movies or you definitely don't see on television shows.
First of all,

772
00:45:22.711 --> 00:45:25.470
like domestic abuse.
Oh yeah,
man.

773
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:28.380
Just smack the fuck out of women all the time.
And those movies,

774
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:33.180
even in like the original movie footloose there are scenes where the main girl

775
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:35.670
is getting the shit kicked out of a black boy fire boyfriend.

776
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.380
And even today if that was happening,
it would,
they wouldn't actually show it.

777
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.250
You know what I mean?

778
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:46.230
Maybe it wouldn't even be in the right,
it wouldn't even be in the,

779
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.800
in the story.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah,
it's um,

780
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.300
it's interesting because I think when you look at something from like 1933 even

781
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:56.820
though I don't think that's exactly how they behaved,

782
00:45:56.821 --> 00:46:01.821
it gives you a window into the culture bizarre view of people from a completely

783
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:06.160
different era.
I mean,
watch gone with the wind and you'll be like,
wow,

784
00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:09.720
this is like the most racist silver vein phrases.
Like,
oh my God.
Yeah.

785
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:12.900
There's a lot of those,
that heartbeat I don't like.

786
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.530
Are People not talking about this?
We know what else is racist as fuck man.

787
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.160
Peter Pan.
Really?
Yeah.
Peter Pan,
the original Peter Pan Cartoon.

788
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:23.340
I was playing it for my kids and uh,
we were like,
Whoa,

789
00:46:23.341 --> 00:46:27.390
like about my native Americans thought need.
I've seen some of those cartoons.

790
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:30.420
Oh my God,
it's,

791
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.280
it's angering and embarrassing.
You know?
It's like,
you're like,
wow.

792
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:38.160
Yeah.
And that was the normal shit that everybody saw.

793
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.390
The old Popeye's are great too.
I've been watching those old great cartoon.

794
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.110
They are great.
Especially the black and white ones.
Those are like,
oh,

795
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.720
today's a violent,
violent as hell.

796
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:53.580
And had pharaoh is always trying to rape olive oil.
Yeah.
Literally like riper.

797
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.920
Like kidnapper.
Yep.
Yeah.
They don't show his hips thrusting.

798
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.020
Right.
Apparently everything else is in there.

799
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.800
Like he's grabbing her and she's screaming.
He's pulling her away.
Yeah.

800
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.390
It doesn't even talk.
He just,
he just wants and shit.
Yeah.

801
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.780
But the violence is so prevalent.

802
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:17.460
It's like Jesus Christ cartoons were all about violence back then and they were

803
00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:20.700
great.
Well,
the weird thing is you can still watch them,

804
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:24.510
but you can never make them.
Like you could still watch my brothers cartoon.

805
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.910
She could still watch Wiley Coyote and writes bunny.

806
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.980
But you could never make a cartoon like that today

807
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.820
<v 1>and put it on television.
We would have to be a niche market,
I guess.
You know?</v>

808
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.510
Well,
it wouldn't be for children.
No,
no,
no.
Not for kids.
But isn't that amazing?

809
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.750
That was where we grew up with.
Yeah.
We'll look at it like some schools,
you know,

810
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.040
they,
you know,
they're not supposed to play dodge ball anymore.
It's like,

811
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.510
it's too dangerous.
We're becoming pussies.

812
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.250
They're getting kids' participation trophies.
Fuck is that.
There's a re,
you know,

813
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.600
it sucks to lose.
Okay.
That's how you get better.
Yeah.

814
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.810
You can't keep your kid look bad.

815
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.540
And the lower income kids who grew up lower income,

816
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.260
they don't have that issue because they're like,
you know,

817
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.930
they're still barefoot and there'll be a five year old kid riding an adult,

818
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:08.590
10 speed,
no helmet on.
You know,
it's like,
that's like,

819
00:48:08.591 --> 00:48:11.500
I like when I lived way out in Queens,
you'd see that shit all the time.
You know,

820
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:13.570
like,
you know,
Latino kid just,
you know,

821
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.570
literally like four years old and on a 10 speed,
no shoes,

822
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:19.060
just cruising down the fucking street.
His parents,
yeah,

823
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.190
you don't see them anywhere.
Just let that kid out.
But he's fine.
She's,

824
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.190
most of them come back alive.
It's just about numbers and he's,
he was good,

825
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.540
you know,
that'd be like an adult riding like a 10 foot bicycle.

826
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.990
Well New York is interesting in that way that you get to see so many different

827
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:36.940
styles of parenting.

828
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:41.941
So many different styles of just living all jammed into one area,

829
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.040
stacked on top of each other,
different boroughs,

830
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:49.390
but all the sort of same central location.
It's not as diverse as it used to be.

831
00:48:49.391 --> 00:48:54.070
It's really becoming a boring kind of city.
It's so,
yeah.

832
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:56.200
And that's happening.
Well I deal with that.

833
00:48:56.201 --> 00:48:59.740
Some of my book here where it's like you go to like one block,

834
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:00.850
we'll literally have,

835
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.540
there's a cvs right next to a rite aid and then a block away there's a Walgreens

836
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.490
and then there's like five banks like on that block.
And it's like,

837
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.400
that's all there is.
You know,
and it's like,
it's like,
it's turning that way,

838
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:17.270
like everywhere.
It's like it's become such a wealthy city.
Uh,
it's,

839
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.200
it's just become,
that's interesting.
Come boring.
You know,
like even a,

840
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.800
they're all like some,
you know,

841
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.830
like when I look at la now and New York at late to me seems in many ways more

842
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:34.360
diverse than New York does because,
you know,

843
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.080
I think an apartment in La is probably half,
you know,

844
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.530
50% cheaper than what it is in New York,
if not more.
Oh,
okay.

845
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:45.190
So it's just sort of priced everybody out.
It's classism basically.

846
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.050
So it's like the only people I know,

847
00:49:47.051 --> 00:49:51.280
doctors in New York City who live in Jersey because they can't afford to live in

848
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:53.780
New York City.
Whoa.
You know,
so it's like,

849
00:49:53.781 --> 00:49:57.880
it's because the finance people make more money than anybody,
you know?
Funny.

850
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.920
Yeah.
All they're doing is moving numbers right now

851
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.610
because I finally deal the number of fun cause I was always like,

852
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:06.520
what are these guys do?
And then I finally realized that they make money.

853
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:07.480
Like what?
Like,

854
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.950
like you do comedy and then people come to the show and you get paid like that.

855
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:16.480
That's a service you provide.
But those finance guys,
they make money.

856
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.440
That's all they do.
They,
they,
they,
they don't do anything.

857
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.380
They just find a way to make more money.
That's all they do.
Well,

858
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:25.810
they didn't even make it.
They just,
yeah.
They don't physically make it.
Yeah.

859
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:28.060
They move around.
They move around but take some from

860
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.760
<v 0>themselves.
Yeah.
Giant chunks of it.
Yeah.
We made a big deal today.</v>

861
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.870
Would you say you moved ones and Zeros for nonphysical place to another

862
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.060
nonphysical place?
It's crazy,

863
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:41.030
but they make all the fucking money and there are a lot of them are fucking

864
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:44.540
barbarians.
I used to work out with a lot of these guys that,
um,

865
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.490
became stock market guys.

866
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.240
They became stockbrokers back in Boston and they were fucking animals.

867
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:52.520
There were savages.
And then I ran into one of them,

868
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:55.760
these worn a suit and tie and he looked great and I was like,
what are you doing?

869
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.850
Like what the fuck?
He goes,
hey,
I'm stocked broken now.
I'm a stockbroker.

870
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.080
And he was just making all this money in the stock market and just doing coke

871
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:07.310
and punching people and that's,
it's a crazy business.

872
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:09.650
I mean there's like no morals at all in that business.

873
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.070
And then a lot of the shit they do I think is illegal in other countries.

874
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:15.910
You know,
it should be,
I mean,
look at what the,

875
00:51:15.911 --> 00:51:19.640
the infamous market crash of 2018 what was that all about?

876
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:24.560
Nobody got prosecuted.
Yeah.
It's kind of crazy if,
if you look at,

877
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.300
I mean how much of the same laws are still in place that allowed them to do that

878
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:34.490
and allowed them to set up the,
the whole subprime mortgage loan crisis thing.

879
00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:38.240
It's like when you look at what that actually was,

880
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:42.540
is like a gigantic pump and dump scheme.
Yeah.
But for the whole country,
yeah.

881
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.550
It's,
it's this crazy that no one went to jail.
No one that,

882
00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.880
that's another thing we're doing.
Or both parties,

883
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.320
both parties are there.
They're not that different.
You know,

884
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:57.770
they get marketed as,
they're so different,
but they're really not that different.

885
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:01.280
You know,
they,
they basically work for whoever has the most money.

886
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.610
I think socially their debts social at that,

887
00:52:03.611 --> 00:52:07.310
that's the only area they're different.
But,
but financially they're,

888
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:11.330
both of them are just corrupt,
feeding the same,
feeling the same shit.
You know,

889
00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:12.500
they don't work for people.

890
00:52:12.501 --> 00:52:16.520
They work for mega corporations that have billions and billions and billions.

891
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.940
Well that's the only way you can get into the White House unless you're a Donald

892
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:23.310
Trump guy.
Yeah.
Unless you have your own money where you can finance your,

893
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.780
I don't even think he has enough money to do it.
I don't hear it.

894
00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:28.220
I don't even think he does really.
I don't think so.
Yeah.

895
00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.870
I just said that I think the money,

896
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:33.860
that the money that you're talking from these corporations is much more than he

897
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:37.250
can have as an individual,
you know?
Um,
and I think most,

898
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.680
I think the biggest reason,
uh,

899
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:45.910
that he's been able to get his message out so much is how much free press he

900
00:52:46.211 --> 00:52:50.510
gets.
Right.
You know,
it's a good point.
It's like the news is always taken whole.

901
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:53.390
I don't know.
How does he keep getting?
How's he keep being ahead?
I'm like,

902
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.140
you're all he fucking shows.
It's right.

903
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:59.270
It's like he's getting hours of free advertisement every fucking day.

904
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:04.271
I've never seen a political campaign where they actually go breaking news trumps

905
00:53:04.641 --> 00:53:07.670
giving a speech in Iowa and then they just showed the whole fucking speech for

906
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:11.510
an hour while they're hoping he says something wacky Muslims never happened

907
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:15.560
before where they actually just show an entire campaign speech,
you know,

908
00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:19.640
and then like,
wow,
I wonder why the other Republicans don't have that much,
uh,

909
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:20.720
volts because you don't,

910
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.870
you didn't even fucking show 30 seconds of their campaign speech.

911
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.750
To me it seems like,
and I don't,
I try not to watch this stuff too much.

912
00:53:28.751 --> 00:53:32.020
It's until it gets down to the last couple of months of the campaign,

913
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.550
but it feels like that what Donald Trump's doing is sprinting.

914
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.640
Like there's a marathon going on and he just came out of the gate running as

915
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:42.270
fast as he can and like,
he's winning like,
well,
you can't keep that up.
Yeah.

916
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.930
We can't keep that up.
And,
and his,
the way he's talking,

917
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.610
it's almost like he's trolling.

918
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.640
Like when he said he wants to ban on Muslims coming into America,
I'm like,

919
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.020
what are you talking about man?
You can't what you gonna Ban Muslims?

920
00:53:55.710 --> 00:54:00.060
All of them just cause you can,
you can't have a religion because what,

921
00:54:00.061 --> 00:54:00.421
wait a minute.

922
00:54:00.421 --> 00:54:03.630
What percentage of the people we talking about that are blowing things up and

923
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:08.190
shooting people?
Is it even one 100th of 1% probably not.

924
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.260
No,
it's not easily.
Not like,

925
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.470
but you're going to ban all the Muslims that are coming.

926
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.380
Go to what the fuck and then out of his fucking mind and then he did a speech

927
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:19.020
about it.
They asked him and he goes,
well,

928
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:21.900
what I'm talking about wouldn't even have to be for that long.

929
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:24.480
Like what are you talking about?
He goes,

930
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:26.970
it just yet until we figure out what the hell is going on.

931
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:30.450
Like he's just speaking these sort of vague terms.
It's like,

932
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.810
I feel like he's trolling.
I don't feel like he's a real serious candidate.
Yeah.

933
00:54:33.811 --> 00:54:38.010
You almost hope it's like in six months he's going to not,

934
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.610
he's going to withdraw and just say the entire thing was like some kind of

935
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:44.100
bizarre performance art thing,
you know,
just,

936
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:48.780
just making fun of our entire media at big Joaquin Phoenix political,

937
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:50.940
uh,
you know,
arena.
You know,

938
00:54:50.941 --> 00:54:55.710
it's just because the news media is just,
it just,
you know,

939
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.440
I mean I don't like them and I think they're fucking horrendous period.

940
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.770
Well what they are as a business.
That's what I'm saying.

941
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.090
And let people don't realize,
you know,

942
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.510
during the entertainment business and that's what's entertaining guy like Donald

943
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.560
Trump is entertaining but they shouldn't be labeled.
Yeah.

944
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.230
They shouldn't be allowed to be called news.

945
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.860
You're right to Fox News and Canada really,

946
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.210
I think they were not allowed to be broadcast in Canada unless they were called

947
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.220
labeled as entertainment and not newness.
Why?
I think so.
That's just,

948
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:27.470
cause someone told me that recently,

949
00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.130
the girls that they have on that show it too distracting
too many.

950
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:37.110
But I think that should be the way with,
you know,
90% of the news,
you know,

951
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.400
because it's just,
you know,
it's,

952
00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:45.030
it's not about giving you real news.
It's about getting viewers.
Yeah.

953
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.660
I mean,
you know,

954
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.180
there's a lot of really interesting things that are going on in the world.

955
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.520
They're not going to cover it because it's not going to,

956
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.050
it's not going to attach to your reptilian brain.
Yeah.
So I'm going to your,
your,

957
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.480
your mind is just like,
when things are slower,
you know,

958
00:55:57.481 --> 00:56:01.390
if there's some missing a eight year old white girl,
you know,
that'll be the,

959
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.960
that'll be the new story for two years.
I mean,

960
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:06.270
how many brown kids get killed every day?
Nothing.

961
00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.440
One little cute white girl with pigtails gets scooped up in a van.

962
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.280
They're finally doing that a little bit less now.
But for you know,
decades.

963
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:18.660
That was the main news thrust.
It works.
Yeah.
That's the thing.
I mean,

964
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:21.840
this Donald Trump thing,
it fucking works.
You have that kind of TV,

965
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:23.470
you're going to get people to pay attention.
Yeah.

966
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:28.540
<v 1>It's sad.
It's sad,
but it's,
it is what it is.</v>

967
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:33.210
But I think today it's sort of opened the door for all these alternative news

968
00:56:33.211 --> 00:56:35.440
sources.
Yeah,
you have,
if you want to get real news,

969
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:37.600
you really have to put effort in.

970
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:39.670
It's not going to just show up on your television.
Well,

971
00:56:39.671 --> 00:56:43.060
the Internet is going to look for a fantastic resource now because you can get

972
00:56:43.061 --> 00:56:46.660
all sorts of unbiased perspectives and perspectives from all these different

973
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:49.830
sides.
You also get misinformation,
so you gotta be careful.
But yeah,

974
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.360
there's a lot of stuff you can get all over the world.
You know,
you can do,

975
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.810
you can go online and watch news from other countries and see how they report.

976
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.400
One of the cool things about New York though,
as opposed to La,

977
00:56:58.401 --> 00:57:02.530
is that New York is not a show Biz Bay city.
Correct.
Yeah.

978
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.490
It's uh,
it's more diverse that way.

979
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.350
But I tell ya more and more and more a just feels like a finance city.

980
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:15.790
Keep hearing that man.
You Giuliani,
Giuliani for eight years.

981
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.150
And then we had Bloomberg for 12.

982
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.330
Now legally you're only allowed to be a mayor for eight maximum.

983
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.170
And then Bloomberg was like,
well,
I want to change things.
And uh,

984
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:28.990
so they did a new vote and,
uh,
it was just amongst,

985
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.950
I think other politicians and he got voted to be allowed to go a third term.

986
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.360
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
So,
and I can Obama do that.
Yeah.
I don't know,

987
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.760
but yeah,
but at Bloomberg and Bloomberg was interesting cause you know,
he,

988
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:45.950
he's a Republican and very conservative in some issues,
you know,

989
00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:50.890
especially financially.
Uh,
but then on some other issues,
um,
he wasn't,

990
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.050
uh,
so,
you know,
he,
he was,

991
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.990
he was good and bad and Giuliani did good and bad things to,
you know,

992
00:57:55.991 --> 00:57:59.080
I mean for the arts,
Giuliani was horrendous.
You know,
he wasn't a,

993
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.100
he was closing down.
They found a loophole from the,
some law firm,

994
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:08.080
the 18 hundreds,
about how you,
you can't have dancing,

995
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:09.670
you have to have a dancing,

996
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:12.640
you have to have a cabaret license if anyone's going to dance at a bar.

997
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:15.010
So if a couple people just,
if you wanted to put on,

998
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.650
if there's a bar and they have an extra room and you want to put on a comedy

999
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:21.030
show,
uh,
or something,
and someone's dancing in a,

1000
00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.860
or a sketch comedy show on someone's dancing in a skit,
they can shut you down.

1001
00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:27.910
Yeah.
So he started acting laws like that.
So he started,

1002
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.130
he started actually enforcing that heats.
Are they started enforcing that?
Yeah.

1003
00:58:31.131 --> 00:58:34.770
Yeah.
Wow.
What was the purpose behind that?
Like why did he,

1004
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.470
why did he want to do that?
What was his motivation?
I don't know.
But you know,

1005
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.020
he also close a lot of the strip clubs.
Uh,
he enacted this,

1006
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:43.690
I think it was either the 60,
40 or the 40 60 law.

1007
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.180
And for awhile there was a comedy club that was,

1008
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:49.030
so basically if you had a strip club,

1009
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:54.450
he changed the laws so that now only 40% of your place can be a strip club.

1010
00:58:54.521 --> 00:58:59.140
60% has to be another business.
That was a lot of,
yeah,
that was a lot of soul.

1011
00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:02.920
So wait a minute,
what does that mean?
Like you could sell hats.
Yeah,
yeah.

1012
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:05.260
Or you know,
you just,
you just have a,

1013
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:09.400
like I remember for awhile when they closed from the porno theaters in Times

1014
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.850
Square,
this is,
these are places that go back pre-internet,
you know,

1015
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:15.760
where you actually go to a movie theater to watch a porno.

1016
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:18.700
Cause I used to be the only place you can fucking watch one and it's just,

1017
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:23.030
you know,
a bunch of depress guys know,
jerking off or waiting to jerk off,

1018
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:26.030
you know.
And uh,
so,
so,
uh,

1019
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:29.150
I went to one of those after they had closed the porn and they were,

1020
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.140
it was a short period,

1021
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:33.800
I think it was only like a few months or something and they were showing,
uh,

1022
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.770
so they were just showing like old John Wayne Movies and shit.

1023
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.550
And there were still just like 30 guys in there.
Just,
you know,

1024
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:43.010
most of these are guys on edge.
This is like 20 years ago,

1025
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.770
guys on edge and like homeless guys just sitting there.
It was,

1026
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:48.830
it was maybe the most depressing thing.
I had seen more,

1027
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:51.920
I think guys were thinking they were still like,
I'm,
I was wondering like,

1028
00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:55.280
do they think they're still going to show the pornos cause it says it's a John

1029
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.690
Wayne movie or are they just like they're just holding on and hopefully that

1030
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:02.800
like loud,
maybe they'll sneak a porno in there.
So it was,

1031
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.420
it was one of the most depressing things I had seen,
uh,

1032
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.240
but be able to show that the 60,
40,
la,

1033
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:11.510
and I remember there was a comedy club for awhile that was in one of them.

1034
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.320
I can't remember,
it was called string fellows or another one.

1035
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:19.490
It was around 21st street and Broadway,
which is,
you know,

1036
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.990
a business and residential area.

1037
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:24.020
It's not like a scenario where there's just tons of porn,
so you have like,

1038
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.160
you know,
expensive apartments and other business stuff.
And then,
oh,

1039
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:32.870
here's a porno place.
And,
uh,
I mean a strip club,
you know?
And so basically,

1040
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:37.940
um,
60% of it became a comedy club.
And,

1041
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.560
uh,
but they still had strippers working there.
And it was such a weird feeling,

1042
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.400
but it was,

1043
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.340
I'd never felt more safe at a comedy club because they still had all the

1044
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:50.390
bouncers from the Strip club there.
So it's all these guys in like Tuxedos,

1045
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.460
these huge dudes in Tuxedos.
And the stage was like really high.
Uh,

1046
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.430
you know,
so cause it's designed to be looking up at strippers,

1047
01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.870
you can't grab you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1048
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:05.720
So and then downstairs we're lockers where the strippers were like changing and

1049
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:09.770
shit.
So you have to be like seeing them down there and how bizarre.
Yeah.

1050
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:13.160
And then you just go through like a little swivel door and then you're in the

1051
01:01:13.161 --> 01:01:15.020
Strip club.
But that didn't last too long.

1052
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:16.950
But they had to do that for a while cause they had it,

1053
01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:19.430
they are the act of these new laws and they had to do something.

1054
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.790
<v 2>Data is so strange.
So this is,
uh,
this is a new law or was it,
no,
this was,</v>

1055
01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.430
this was,
this was when Giuliani,
I bet.

1056
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.900
I think the 60 40 was a new law that he enacted.

1057
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.610
But what that doesn't even make any sense,

1058
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.240
but is it 60% in terms of revenue or is in terms of physical space of this

1059
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.800
physical space?
Here it is right here.
A legacy of the Giuliani era.

1060
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.840
New York is 60,
40 rule,
uh,

1061
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.580
forces any adult business to devote more than 40% of its square footage to adult

1062
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.870
and attorney.
Ma'Am,
no more than 40% to adult entertainment.

1063
01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:54.620
Meaning the Strip clubs must fill the other 60% with non adult business

1064
01:01:54.621 --> 01:01:55.454
endeavors.

1065
01:01:55.790 --> 01:02:00.790
This is why the Penthouse Executive Club has Robert Steakhouse in New York.

1066
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:05.610
Dolls has a bikini bar.
Front Lounge.
What an asshole.
Yeah.

1067
01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:09.440
So what an asshole.
That most of them,
I'm

1068
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.040
<v 1>just fucking went out of business and they're gone.
They're just gone.</v>

1069
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:14.780
You know what a shit.

1070
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:18.230
But I remember going to New York and like 81 and it was so cool.

1071
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:19.740
You would see cats,
you know,

1072
01:02:19.741 --> 01:02:23.070
the big Broadway show catch and then right next to it,
the sperm donator.

1073
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:27.750
And it was just like,
I love,
I just love that,
that variety,
you know,

1074
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.820
that dichotomy of seeing,
you know,

1075
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:33.660
the grungiest shit next to the highest end shit,
you know?
And it was just,

1076
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:37.290
it was exciting,
you know,
but now it's just,
it's just corporate,
corporate,

1077
01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:40.280
corporate,
corporate,
corporate will change.
Change,
change,
change.
Yeah.

1078
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.650
But it almost,
it's almost like,
like time squares now I'll just chain places,

1079
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:47.310
but now that's becoming,
you just see it spreading throughout the whole city.

1080
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.440
Yeah.
I like,
I like,
I overhear college kids,
you know,
and they're,
they're excited.

1081
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.550
They're like,
oh yeah,
my dorm.
So great.
Cause there's a Panera bread,
uh,

1082
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.330
right next to it and uh,
and there's a quiz knows,
uh,
you know,

1083
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.880
right nearby and I'm just like,
fuck.
You know,
it's like,

1084
01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:07.210
it's hard to even get a good slice of pizza in New York anymore because,
uh,

1085
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.930
much water,
two things happened.
Um,
1640,
no,
not the 60,

1086
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.630
40% porn.
That'd be cool.

1087
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.170
You're business has to be 40% or 40% tits.
Yeah.

1088
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.310
So what happened with the pizza is,
well,
first of all,

1089
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.710
Manhattan and half of Brooklyn,

1090
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.560
hardly any of the people that live there actually from New York anymore.

1091
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:30.390
She don't even like you don't have,

1092
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.230
so you have people moving from the suburbs so they don't really know good pizza.

1093
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.850
So they're not really New Yorkers.

1094
01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:38.220
They're just kind of live in there because they're making a lot of money now.

1095
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.280
Yeah.
So instead of like,
you know how La is very transient,
everyone,

1096
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.560
like I was voted most beautiful in high school,

1097
01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:46.640
so I'm going to go to La and try to become an actor or an actress,
you know?
Well,

1098
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.450
New York is now,
uh,

1099
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:53.490
I got good grades in school and my dad works for this firm and that firm hired

1100
01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:56.940
me in New York.
So that's why I'm in New York,
you know?
So it's,
uh,

1101
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:02.490
it's changed a lot.
Like almost every girl I've gone out with in the past seven,

1102
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:07.491
eight years is either finance or a corporate lawyer or something like that.

1103
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.930
And because that's,
that's who you meet,
you know,
it's like,

1104
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't meet anyone like here in la.

1105
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:17.270
Everyone I meet is doing something in arts or entertainment or are trying to,

1106
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:21.510
you know,
and in New York it's,
that happens maybe five,
10% of the time.

1107
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:25.260
How bizarre.
So it's just a gigantic financial city now.

1108
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.290
And that's what's Bloomberg.
It cause he has,
that's his background.

1109
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:31.470
And his goal was to make it the financial center of the world.

1110
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.600
And I think he kinda did,
you know,

1111
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:38.250
cause when I first started doing comedy in New York in the late eighties and

1112
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.910
early nineties,
you know,
uh,

1113
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.660
cause I moved to New York in [inaudible] 87 there was always,
you know,

1114
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.760
the Wall Street guys,
you know,
and,

1115
01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:48.840
but that was down in one area and Wall Street.
And now that,

1116
01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:52.740
that business is throughout the whole city,
you know,
so it's,
it's a,

1117
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:56.880
it's grown and uh,
it's getting hard to reverse.

1118
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:02.280
Yeah.
I don't,
you know,
can,
you can sort of gentrify an area,

1119
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.640
but taking an area and making it like more local and independent and,

1120
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.190
and getting like artists and stuff.
And I look,
yeah,
cause I think even,

1121
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.240
I remember even years ago,
comics and you know,
you know,

1122
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.040
and some people might say,

1123
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.250
<v 0>oh this is sex wherever,
you know,
I think it's just guy locker room talk.</v>

1124
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.100
But to have arguments who's got hotter chicks,

1125
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.980
New York or la I remember was definitely sexist.
Yeah.

1126
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.790
And we don't allow that on this show because you can't talk about feelings.
Yeah.

1127
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.600
So anyways,
so I've met,
so eras,
you know,
comics we used to,
you know,

1128
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:35.660
you travel around you,

1129
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.840
but you always have the argument who's got the hotter chicks,

1130
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:41.770
New York and La and some in Canada is very hot.
Very much so.

1131
01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.380
So they um,
uh,

1132
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.150
so like it used to be like,
it was always close,
you know?

1133
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:52.270
And then some guys would always look good with La.
Some guys would say New York.

1134
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.220
And now I think if you would have to place the vote,
I think la would win easily.

1135
01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.300
You know,
cause uh,
New York you don't,
you don't see the variety of,

1136
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:05.170
like you used to see women from all over the world.
So the,
the,
you know,

1137
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.150
everyone in the planet,
you'd see women,
you know,

1138
01:06:07.151 --> 01:06:09.000
it was beautiful women from everywhere and it was just,
you know,

1139
01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:12.490
that you don't see this variety anywhere.
But in New York you would see it.

1140
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:15.740
Now you don't see it that much and you know,
you,

1141
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.730
you don't even see a lot of interesting fashion walking around the streets of

1142
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:20.350
New York.
He used to always see that,
you know,

1143
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.170
because if everyone's working in finance,
that's,
you know,

1144
01:06:23.171 --> 01:06:26.020
that's not the most fashionable bull group of people.
You know,

1145
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:28.790
they're not interested in that.
The worst when you,

1146
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:33.710
in terms of like artistic people and in terms of like creative people.
Yeah.

1147
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.000
Like if that's going to take over,
that's going to be the worst for that.

1148
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:42.350
It'd be for hotness you mean?
No,
I mean for having diversity,
for having people,

1149
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:45.040
for having an artistic people like that.

1150
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:48.040
There's a lot of industries that could move in where things can be kind of cool.

1151
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:52.360
Like if the tech industry moves in,
like San Francisco is a good example,
right?

1152
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:54.850
A lot of money in San Francisco and a lot of people are complaining,

1153
01:06:54.851 --> 01:06:57.680
but a lot of weird,
cool shit is there too still.
Right.

1154
01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.250
Like a lot of freaky people.
It's interesting.

1155
01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:04.090
A lot of the people in tech are unique and odd and eccentric.
Right?

1156
01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:08.350
You're not getting that and finance not getting,
not your native types.
No,
no.

1157
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:11.350
And you often,
when you meet him,
you know,
in a lot of them are nice to,
you know,

1158
01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:14.380
the,
that they usually kind of heckle themselves,
you know,
say they're boring,

1159
01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:16.730
they work on their job or whatever,
you know,
but,
you know,

1160
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:22.020
but it's one of the clubs like,
well,
the clubs are doing well because you have a,

1161
01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.620
you know,
the city,
since it's gotten safer,
uh,
the tourism is up,

1162
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.450
you know,
and a lot safer,
much safer than it was 20 years ago.
Much,
much safer.

1163
01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:36.130
Yeah.
It's,
you know,
it's,
you know,
it's,
there's not much crime there.

1164
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.510
Uh,
there just isn't.
That's incredible.
Yeah.
You know,
cause I mean,
if every,

1165
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:45.870
if one bedroom apartments are anywhere from $500,000 to one point $5 million,

1166
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.070
uh,

1167
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:52.420
and that's a one bedroom that's probably 70% smaller than a one bedroom in la.

1168
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.760
It's like a,
like a,
you know,
a new,

1169
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:59.110
a new one bedroom in the village in New York will be,
uh,

1170
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:01.930
well over a million dollars.
Yeah.
We,
we,

1171
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:05.200
we thought about my wife and I thought about getting a place her at one point in

1172
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:07.540
time we were like,
maybe we should move to New York.
Maybe be a good thing.

1173
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:08.800
Maybe we to try something different.

1174
01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:11.980
We're looking at apartments that were three bedroom for 5 million bucks.

1175
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.980
It's insane.
That's crazy.
You can,
you can buy

1176
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.580
<v 1>two houses in the Hollywood hills for that.
Yeah.
It's a fucking apartment.</v>

1177
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:22.670
So you don't even have a yard.
You don't even have a parking spot.

1178
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:26.240
And also those apartments,
unlike if you buy a house,

1179
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:30.890
they have the building monthly maintenance fees,
which can be easily,

1180
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.570
you know,
two to three grand a month and that's just going out the window,

1181
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.410
you know?
So it's like,
it's like owning and renting at the same time era.

1182
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:41.510
That's the way I put it.
It's like,

1183
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:46.100
so like for years I've been thinking about buying a place and then I'll look for

1184
01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:48.140
a few months,
then I'll get frustrated,
I'll quit.

1185
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:52.330
And then the next day stay there.
I don't know,
I think for,
well,
you know,
my,

1186
01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.740
my folks and my brother there in Maryland and DC,

1187
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:59.270
so I kind of want to be close to them.
Um,
and I,
you know,

1188
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:00.850
every time I come to la I always,

1189
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.880
because I lived out here for a couple of years and then early two thousands I,

1190
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.340
I keep thinking,
oh,
maybe I should just move here,
you know?
So I just,

1191
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:09.440
I don't know where I'm at the point in my career.
Like,

1192
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:12.920
I don't know where I want to live.
Yeah.
It was fun to Ethan Anthony Bordain.

1193
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:16.030
He was like this longterm New Yorker.
Yeah.
And he was like,
you know,

1194
01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:18.720
kind of like when I think of New York,
I think the guys like,
yeah,
sure.
Yeah.

1195
01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:23.090
He was telling me that he had thought about it many times.
But living in La,
yeah.

1196
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.170
I'm like really?

1197
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.950
So I think people are recognizing that there's like a weird shift that's going

1198
01:09:27.951 --> 01:09:32.240
on.
Yeah.
Well people,
I remember,
you know,
1520 years ago,
the big thing with,

1199
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.140
there's always been this sort of,
you'll love hate with La and New York.
You know,

1200
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:40.940
I always notice like it seems like there's always la comics seem to have a

1201
01:09:40.941 --> 01:09:44.180
little bit of a fear towards New York comics.
Little bit or a little bit,

1202
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:46.700
sort of like respect where I've always known it even with like club owners,

1203
01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:50.030
it's like,
well,
or even with actors even notice a little in New York actor,

1204
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.690
I mean the divine didn't know stage.
And then even with with,
with,

1205
01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:56.380
with la it's like,
oh those New York guys,
they're going on,

1206
01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.360
they're getting on six,
seven times a night.
They're just in New York.

1207
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.760
Cause they just want comedy.
They don't,
they're not interested in other stuff.

1208
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:05.390
And I'm like,
you guys are really exaggerating things a lot.
It's like,

1209
01:10:05.391 --> 01:10:06.520
first of all,
you,

1210
01:10:06.521 --> 01:10:09.560
you can't be doing six and seven shows a night every fucking night.
It just,

1211
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.510
you know,
once in a while you can do that,

1212
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.940
but you're going to go fucking crazy if you do that.

1213
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:15.440
And then just geographically,

1214
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:19.200
getting to all those spots on time is not fucking easy to do unless you have a

1215
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.510
pill.
Berta helicopter you around the city,
right.
Trying to sell.

1216
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.990
So I,
most comics just aren't doing that many.
You know,

1217
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:31.730
New York City does have more comedy clubs in La,
but,
um,

1218
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.870
and the city's also geographically smaller,
so you can get to them.

1219
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:39.740
But if you're doing,
let's say you do four shows in one night,

1220
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:44.540
you're probably going to be spending,
uh,
to just to get to those,

1221
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:47.840
you're going to need a cab.
So you're probably gonna be spending,
you know,

1222
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:52.841
40 to 50 to $60 a night and you're probably making seven fifties,

1223
01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:58.700
you know what I mean?
So,
so it's like,
there's not that much.
So,

1224
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.860
yeah.
No.
I also think now,

1225
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:02.900
compared to when I lived here in the early two thousands the,

1226
01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.660
the comedy scene in La has grown.
I think it's very healthy here and,

1227
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.870
and I think it's much better.

1228
01:11:08.871 --> 01:11:13.770
The store is like rock and every night and they got fire and they got three
rooms

1229
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.340
<v 0>and they're all great fucking rooms with each and each one has a different</v>

1230
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:18.370
personality to know.

1231
01:11:18.371 --> 01:11:22.710
What's crazy this year is the first year the store has been profitable in like

1232
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:27.510
forever.
Wow.
Did I believe it does last year?
It's crazy.
I mean,

1233
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:30.800
Adam's done a,
you know,
best.
He's amazing man.

1234
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.030
I fucking love that guy.

1235
01:11:33.031 --> 01:11:37.740
It's so cool having a guy who's like the talent coordinator who's just a
regular,

1236
01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:40.230
like he's my friend,
that guy.

1237
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.440
It's very rare that anything like that ever happened.
He's the best.

1238
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:48.390
He's the best.
But you know,
I mean,
of the two cities in America,

1239
01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:52.860
you know,
La in New York has the most comics and the best comics,
you know,

1240
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:56.130
or there's a really underrated scene where Denver,
I,
you know,

1241
01:11:56.131 --> 01:12:00.030
a lot of good comics come out at Denver.
I believe that dance odors from there,

1242
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.170
uh,
can't think of who else.
Right.
When Curtis,
one woman,
right,
right.

1243
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.250
She's the best.
She's an animal.
That chick,
she's on that place forever.

1244
01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:09.080
She's been,
what?
She's,

1245
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.910
she started working there as a waitress at the comedy works.
That's awesome.

1246
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.890
And then she established,
when she started taking over,

1247
01:12:13.891 --> 01:12:16.780
she established like a whole system,
like an open Mike system,

1248
01:12:16.781 --> 01:12:21.540
but a system of taking people from a open makers to making them MCS to making

1249
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:25.140
the middle acts and making headliners.
She's got like locally made headlines.

1250
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:25.710
That's awesome.

1251
01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:30.150
Like legit comics that go on and they go on the road and it's amazing.

1252
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.670
Well I think at that point you bring up is interesting cause I think you know,

1253
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:37.620
years ago there were,

1254
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:41.400
there were like a few main cities if you want it to be different or do
something,

1255
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:45.540
entertainment,
there's too much New York and La and now it's like there's,

1256
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:47.730
or even if like,
let's say,
you know,

1257
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:50.790
if you know 40 years ago if you wanted to be gay,

1258
01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:53.240
you would move to one of the big cities.
Right.
You know,

1259
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.610
but now it's like every city has their gay communities,
like little town,

1260
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.900
you know,
buffalo has a big gay community.

1261
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:03.330
Don't you think that's the internet is a big part of that I find.
Yeah,
I do.
I do.

1262
01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:04.770
And I think just,
uh,

1263
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:09.960
but I think that the fact that other places have gotten better is also another

1264
01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:12.900
reason New York has gotten more generic because if you're a freak,

1265
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:15.930
if you're a Weirdo and outsider,
people would be like,
move to New York,

1266
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:18.120
move to the big city,
get away from the small town.

1267
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.770
Now you can find cool shit in your small town.
Right.
You know,
so you don't,

1268
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:25.770
so it's not attracting that as much as the interesting people's it used to for

1269
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:30.090
that reason,
which is great,
you know?
But then the finance thing and then the,

1270
01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.900
with everything being so expensive,
I actually think there's,

1271
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.680
La has a lot of interesting people moving to it and living in La,

1272
01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:42.000
I think la has a lot of cool shit going on in entertainment and an art,
you know,

1273
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.950
it's,
I think so standup comedy,

1274
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:47.100
I think it's the best place right now I think is the best place as far as the

1275
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:47.990
amount of talent,

1276
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:51.030
the amount of like really high level people there and the amount of like really

1277
01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:53.450
good clubs.
It's the best.
It's hard.
Yeah.

1278
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:58.470
I couldn't say which cities better.
They're,
they're both excellent.

1279
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:59.463
Um,

1280
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:05.190
New York still has more clubs and there are different kind of club though

1281
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:09.030
they're smaller or they're much smaller stage.
It's much smaller,
much smaller,

1282
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:12.100
smaller stage also lends to a different style

1283
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.870
<v 2>of comedy.
Does it,
does more personal?
More like where are you from sir?</v>

1284
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.480
Like that kind of shit.
Yeah,
less,
less movement.
Small state.

1285
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.840
I liked comics in general.
I mean these are big generalizations,

1286
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:27.520
but in general a little more physical.
Um,
yeah.
So it's,

1287
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.340
you know,
it's interesting.
I don't know.

1288
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.010
But I think all the three of the main clubs or are doing quite well in La,

1289
01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.700
you know,
they definitely are not doing that good.
Oh it isn't.
Okay.

1290
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:39.970
You can go to the laugh factory on a many a night and it's half half frill it

1291
01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.370
cause when I lived here in the early two thousands,

1292
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:45.520
that was like the happening club.
Yeah.
Improv in the store.

1293
01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:48.880
We're kind of struggling.
This store and the Improv are killing it right now.

1294
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:52.120
The improv has two clubs now.
I know I did their little room,
uh,

1295
01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.350
when I was here last month.
It was great.
Yeah.

1296
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.870
It's really cool how they've set that up.

1297
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:57.610
That's a smart move the way they've done it.

1298
01:14:57.611 --> 01:14:59.700
That's how it used to be a long time ago.
How real.

1299
01:14:59.701 --> 01:15:03.820
That's the actually where Ari should fear started off his powerful arch for your

1300
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:07.990
tee shirt.
And I know I saw that our shift fear started off his,
uh,

1301
01:15:07.991 --> 01:15:12.130
this is not happening.
Show.
Oh I didn't know that.
He started off in the annex,

1302
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.040
which is like this little side room and he nurtured it like this that showed

1303
01:15:16.041 --> 01:15:20.610
that he has on comedy central is a genuine hard work success story.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1304
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:24.460
Because we'd already did is he had this concept and this concept was,
um,

1305
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:28.390
this'll be a good way to generate new material if instead of being under the

1306
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:32.320
pressure of like punchline,
punchline,
punchline and doing the standup sense,

1307
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.080
let's do something where he'd just tell stories,
right?
Like,

1308
01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:37.720
here's a crazy fucked up story that happened to me and out of that story,

1309
01:15:37.721 --> 01:15:39.560
maybe there'll be some jokes,
right.

1310
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:44.110
They'll be some something that you can mine that.
So he,
uh,

1311
01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:48.430
he did that and then eventually went to do it on the web that it on the web and

1312
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:52.730
then eventually comedy central picked it up and now it's on its third season on

1313
01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.390
it.
That's awesome.
It's amazing.
It's beautiful.

1314
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:59.210
And it's just a matter of like growing,
you know,

1315
01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.840
putting it together or it,
it grows nurturing it more growth.
Just,

1316
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.390
just being able to have space like La,
like New York,
there's no space here,

1317
01:16:07.391 --> 01:16:11.590
this space.
Exactly.
Even if you look at podcasting,

1318
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:13.900
I mean,
I'm not an expert on this,

1319
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:16.750
but it seems to me that it started basically in La,

1320
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:19.660
it's an la kind of movement,
the podcasting,

1321
01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:24.340
and if you look at the big podcasts for comedy,
you know it's La.

1322
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:28.480
I remember like when I would,
when I first started coming out here in like,

1323
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.340
like probably like late nineties early two thousands it was weird.

1324
01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.690
It's like comics would come at the story you're like about new car,

1325
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.401
New York comics.

1326
01:16:36.401 --> 01:16:39.670
They didn't move out here and they basically just stopped doing comedy because

1327
01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:42.370
it was too hard to get on what enough places to get on.

1328
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.420
And then before he knew it,

1329
01:16:43.421 --> 01:16:46.960
they're just going out every once in a while or every week,
you know,

1330
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:50.640
getting drunk and doing karaoke.
That was like the thing.
Yeah,

1331
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:53.110
it seemed like there was a lot of,
cops were always going out doing karaoke.

1332
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:54.730
Like when I first moved here,
came down and the like,

1333
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:56.470
who live with hanging out with,
I don't know.

1334
01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:59.100
There's a lot of fucking comics that were doing that.
And I'm like,
I'm like,
no,

1335
01:16:59.101 --> 01:17:02.230
I'm one of those people.
I don't want to fucking do Karaoke.
I want to do comedy.

1336
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:04.360
I'm not coming down here and do that shit.
You know?

1337
01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:08.800
But then at some point it's like,
and also there's more free time out here.

1338
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.670
It's like New York.
You're constantly

1339
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.810
<v 0>just,
I'm not talking about conferences as a person,
you're constantly rushed.</v>

1340
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:18.260
Like what?
Like what,
it's just a busy city.
It's so congested.
It's like,

1341
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:22.040
it's hard to relax,
you know?
Here you can relax,
you got space,

1342
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:25.970
you can get privacy,
you can relax.
Like when people in New York on vacation,

1343
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.810
they usually want to do something boring.
When people in la going on vacation,

1344
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.420
they want to do something exciting ecotourism,
you know what I mean?

1345
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.960
So paragliding.
Yeah,
so there's more.
But I,

1346
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.420
I really like,
uh,

1347
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.020
and the audiences are a little different between New York and here,

1348
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:45.020
but a New York really only has,

1349
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:47.780
even though it has like probably 15 comedy clubs,

1350
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.640
there's probably only about three that are like actually good.

1351
01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:54.500
I think he has a lot more than 15 I think New York has a shitload of comedy

1352
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:58.040
clubs.
Yeah,
I don't know.
I think there's more than a hundred.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1353
01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:02.740
Not fulltime comedy clubs.
Know what?
Find out Jamie.
Yeah,
maybe.

1354
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.930
Maybe it was New York.
I don't know.
That's a lot though.
Hedge your bets.

1355
01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.310
What'd he say?
What's the over under?
I'm going to go 19 I'm going 50 okay.

1356
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.540
I went with a hundred just to be cocky.
I say this but la has,

1357
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:17.270
I mean if you look at la they probably have like eight now.
Right?

1358
01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.760
Well in the greater la area there's quite a few like you know what's really good

1359
01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:24.090
and I just started doing the new Haha cafe in north Hollywood.
I did.

1360
01:18:24.091 --> 01:18:26.390
They have a new one?
Yeah Dude.

1361
01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:29.450
I did it last second at night and now I'm doing it this Thursday night.

1362
01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:32.750
The Gospel of fucking incredible.
I'm going to swing down there.

1363
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.250
It's perfectly set up.

1364
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:39.251
Low ceiling packed in that years ago I remember the old one.

1365
01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.930
Yeah.
Every time I went there the stage was at a different spot.

1366
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:45.040
Like the guy was constantly redoing it.
Well I got to check that out.

1367
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.140
The old one is just down the street from the new one,
just down the street.

1368
01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.070
Is it still there?
Yeah,
it's still there.
So there's two of them.
Yeah,

1369
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.430
but one of them's a ha ha.
One of them.

1370
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.680
Something else now it's like the same owner.
No,

1371
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.890
I think he still owns it and he leases it out to somebody.

1372
01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.060
But the new spot is a gem.
The new spot is one of the best clubs in the city.

1373
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:06.980
Awesome.
Perfect.
I was like,
wow,
this place is fucking Hoppen.
That's cool.

1374
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:10.860
Yeah.
I did it last Thursday and I was like,
wow,
I'm sold man.
Let's,

1375
01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:13.730
I will nurture this place,
keep this place going.
That's awesome.

1376
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.630
When I prepared for my last comedy central special last August,

1377
01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:20.480
I was doing the ha ha all the time.
Oh cool.

1378
01:19:20.481 --> 01:19:23.090
I was doing it like every Tuesday night for like a few months.

1379
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.300
And you were doing it like a long set,
right?
Yeah.

1380
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.240
Cause you can fuck around there.
You got to do the wrong sets there.

1381
01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:31.430
And then there's flappers,
which I don't,
I haven't done that yet,
but her bank,

1382
01:19:31.431 --> 01:19:35.390
yeah,
I've done it once.
It was really good.
But uh,
you know,
you can do that.

1383
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:38.610
The Ice House,
which I'm doing tonight,
I have a 10 show there tonight.

1384
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.200
That place is the shit.
Yeah.
Everyone loves that.
I haven't been there yet.

1385
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.480
You haven't been?
Not yet.
No.
You around tonight?

1386
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:49.880
I don't think I can tonight to show.
Yeah,
I think people down 10 o'clock.

1387
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.780
Okay.
But tonight it's sold out.
It's a Greg Fitzsimmons,

1388
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:59.050
Tony Hinchcliffe.
Uh,
Bert Kreischer.
Cool.
And uh,

1389
01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.440
who fuck Alex.
I wrote Al Magical too.
Oh cool.
I'll tell the show.
I love a show.

1390
01:20:03.441 --> 01:20:06.500
God Damn it.
Yeah.
But the ice house,
the oldest comedy club in the world,

1391
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.160
the known world

1392
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:12.960
<v 2>is maybe the universe,
the whole universe.
The oldest comedy club.
Yes.</v>

1393
01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.650
Is the oldest place.
It was a legitimate ice house,

1394
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.400
like where you would get ice back when people didn't have freezers.
Yeah.
Oh,

1395
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:23.460
you get a chunk of ice and you put it in the ice box and the right to keep your

1396
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:25.530
food perishables cold.

1397
01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:30.770
And then in the 1960s very early sixties it became a comedy club.

1398
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:35.220
So it's been a legitimate comedy club for more than 50 years.
That's awesome.

1399
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.690
Yeah,
it's the abashed that's my favorite place in the planet next to the store.

1400
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.970
The store is different in different places cause it's like this crazy psycho

1401
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.520
energy gym or you know,

1402
01:20:47.521 --> 01:20:51.180
you're fucking around and you're working and you'll bring up,
you know,

1403
01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:52.620
there's like a million great comics.

1404
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:55.320
You bring it up being an Edwards and this guy and that guy.
And it's like,

1405
01:20:55.590 --> 01:21:00.430
it's just,
you look at the lineup and it's like 13 murders.
Yeah.

1406
01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.690
Well,
yeah,
no,
it's great.
It's,
it's,
uh,
yeah,
I,

1407
01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:08.210
I enjoyed doing that.
The audiences are always,
it seems like they always,
like,

1408
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.280
I can't quite put it into words what the differences are,

1409
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:12.780
but they're always the west coast in general,

1410
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:14.880
like a little bit different than east coast audiences.

1411
01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:18.940
But the [inaudible] seem to be more cynical.
Yeah,
of course.
In a gold,

1412
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.010
the little less squeamish,
like the darker shuttle a bit more sometimes,

1413
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.510
but not always,
you know?
Well,
I think to just the cold and the,
you know,

1414
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:32.511
the Dang packed in and to just everybody just jammed on top of each other is

1415
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:37.500
more,
is more like anger there.
Yeah.
Well,

1416
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.900
although are they let it out more?
Sometimes.

1417
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.720
Sometimes I think it was more anger in la,
but it's more pent up.

1418
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:45.180
There's something about New York though,
when I stay there,

1419
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:49.050
whenever I'm staying there and I'm in a hotel and I look out the window and I

1420
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:53.430
just see this insane construction,
this thing that people have put together,

1421
01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:58.431
this modern beehive cement and steel and glass,

1422
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:02.250
like this is amazing.
Especially at night.
Like I,
last time I was there,

1423
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:07.050
I spent a good solid two hours just sitting at the desk in my hotel room looking

1424
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:10.920
out the window,
just looking,
just looking.
Where,
uh,
where were,
where did you say?

1425
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.580
I don't remember which one.
Oh,
last time was at the Trump tower.
Um,

1426
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:17.780
but I've probably stayed a bunch of different Soho,
Soho,

1427
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:21.570
one bunch of different places,
but I forget which place I was at.

1428
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:26.070
I was at one place once where I was in the middle of like all these buildings

1429
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.200
and it was,
it was like freaky.
Like you look out the window,

1430
01:22:28.201 --> 01:22:30.790
you're looking at somebody else and they're looking out the window.
Yeah.

1431
01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.980
His fucking buildings stacked on top of buildings to get privacy.

1432
01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:38.620
There's almost no,
I mean how many people watch people fuck in New York?
Yeah.

1433
01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.480
Gotta be really common.
Yeah.
There was a radio lab podcast about that.

1434
01:22:42.481 --> 01:22:43.440
It was really strange.

1435
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.390
It was about this woman and she was telling the tale of how she watched this

1436
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:51.540
couple and she would watch this cop all the time and it made her kind of feel

1437
01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:54.240
weird about her own relationship cause its couple,

1438
01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:56.430
they were young and they would fuck all the time and they would,

1439
01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.230
they didn't have the curtains drawn,
they were just fun.

1440
01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.630
She would just watch these people fuck.

1441
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.410
And then the guy got sick and then like the family would be over and she was

1442
01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:08.740
watching this like with her weight and then he died and then they carried him

1443
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.320
out of the building and as she saw us,
yeah.

1444
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.950
Over the course of I want to stop watching a long time.
So she,
well she kind of,

1445
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:18.760
it was her window tells her view and then it's like I look out my window and

1446
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:22.280
there's a tree that I like to look at you.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
That couple,

1447
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.200
she ran down stairs as they were taking the body out and putting it in a hearse

1448
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:33.850
and she know she like made eye contact with the girl who lived with the guy and

1449
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:36.610
they taking the body out and she just felt like such a creep.

1450
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:40.750
But she also felt like she knew them.
Like it was like had a relationship.
Yeah.

1451
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah.
They did it with her,
but she did it with them.

1452
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.810
That's a uniquely New York thing to happen because anywhere else,

1453
01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:49.840
like you'd be a fucking creep.
Like you'd have to be some guy without,

1454
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:52.900
she's still a fucking creek,
but yes.
I see what you're saying.

1455
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:56.890
I don't think she is.
I think she's just looking at her world.
Look,

1456
01:23:56.891 --> 01:24:00.520
I don't think it's her responsibility to look away when some people are fucking

1457
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:05.320
and they're 30 yards outside of her window and they're in a window themselves

1458
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:09.430
drawn display.
Will we pretending you're right.

1459
01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:14.220
Windows are meant to be looked at through a looked out of and looked into it

1460
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.900
correctly.
It works both ways.
I don't think she's a creepy at all.

1461
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:21.420
I think she's looking at her world,
but it was interesting how she had she,

1462
01:24:21.421 --> 01:24:24.720
she was really good at narrating this and the gray.
Yeah,

1463
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:25.930
I think they had cool movie.

1464
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.050
Well I don't know about that and depress the fuck Outta here I think because in

1465
01:24:29.051 --> 01:24:32.500
the end that dude dies,
you know,
there's no heroes in that movie.

1466
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.390
But she ran downstairs and like made eye contact with the P and they were like,

1467
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.150
what the fuck are you?
And she's like,
Oh God.
I realize like they don't know me,

1468
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.450
but I know them and I'm a creep.
I gotta get Outta here and then just took off.

1469
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:48.010
But that's super common in New York where people like,
oh,
there's the guy,

1470
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.210
there's the guy who practices the trumpet.
There's the guy who jerks off.

1471
01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:57.430
Yeah.
I wish I had,
I don't have any neighbors like that,
but that sounds awesome.

1472
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.630
Do you look out your window?
There's definitely a building.

1473
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:04.900
There was like an expensive building right behind mine and,

1474
01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:07.420
and you look at it and you can just see everyone's stuff,

1475
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:11.360
but I hardly ever look out.
Yeah,
why wouldn't you?
You don't look out at those?

1476
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.860
Cause they can,
they'll be able to see me.
Yeah.

1477
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:17.650
Then it's like now hat on and especially if I,
then I,

1478
01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.460
then if I get recognized and there'll be blogging about your,
yeah,

1479
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:24.540
why are you looking at are fucking apartment from again,

1480
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:28.570
then it will show is that world champion guy.

1481
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:33.370
I lost my thing and unplug that thing.
We've got to fix that,
Jamie.

1482
01:25:33.371 --> 01:25:36.670
That's happening way too often.
I go,
damn,
I got to,
it's all good.

1483
01:25:36.850 --> 01:25:40.390
We'll get you on the Paul.
Um,
yeah,
that's,

1484
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.320
that's a weird way of living.
Stacked on top of everybody.

1485
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:48.410
Like everywhere else in the country.
Pretty much other than,
you know,

1486
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:52.750
Chicago and some other spots.
Most people were sort of,

1487
01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:55.840
they have a house and a little bit of a yard and then there's another house over

1488
01:25:55.841 --> 01:25:58.210
there and a little bit of yard.
Yeah,
you get some privacy.

1489
01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.060
It's weird how like they just decide one area is the area,

1490
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:04.130
like everybody get here,
get here.
Solyndra is a river

1491
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:08.060
<v 0>that has gold,
salmon swimming.
Initially that's what it was.</v>

1492
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:10.220
I mean if you look at almost all big cities,

1493
01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:13.790
they're usually on some body of water.
But now it's,

1494
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.180
that's not really why it is.
It's just,
yeah.

1495
01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.400
Well there's other places that don't have a reason other than the fact that

1496
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:21.950
they're cool,
but people are flying and you're like Austin,
Texas,

1497
01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:26.580
the middle of Texas.
And every time I go there I'm like Jesus Christ to what?

1498
01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:30.290
Did a thousand people a day move here for the last 15 years?

1499
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:33.710
Like what the fuck is going on?
Yeah,
but that is what's happening now.

1500
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.580
They keep hearing like I'm fucking up right now by saying Austin is awesome.

1501
01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:40.850
It is an awesome.
So they've been doing that for years.

1502
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:43.130
Where the people who are from there like,
fuck,

1503
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.880
stop telling people about this getting too crowded now.
You know.

1504
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:50.480
And that's the thing that pulls people there is the university.
Yeah.

1505
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:54.050
That's another thing that pulls people like likeminded people,

1506
01:26:54.051 --> 01:26:59.030
intelligent people,
educated people.
And then they're also like,

1507
01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:03.200
it's out of all of the areas in Texas.
It's the most open minded,

1508
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:06.200
the most diverse.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
No,

1509
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:10.160
that there's a live a lot of good food there too.
Oh yeah.
Taxes has great food,

1510
01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.300
period.
Fuck yeah.
I don't think,
I don't think you can get a bad meal in Texas.

1511
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:17.210
You can definitely get a bad meal in Texas.
Have an animal.
You can do it.

1512
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:20.960
I'll get you there.
Okay.
I'll get you in.
Well,
do you work in Texas at all?
Yeah.

1513
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.380
What do you,
what clubs do you do?
A Cap city cap city.

1514
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:28.010
I'll do the Moontower festival.
Have been there in a while,
but uh,

1515
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:32.720
the club in Dallas or Addison.
Addison.
And that's a really good club.

1516
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:36.920
Yeah.
Houston used to be the shit.
Yeah.
Years ago.

1517
01:27:36.921 --> 01:27:40.280
But I don't really go there anymore.
I haven't been there in awhile.

1518
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:44.810
I've done colleges in round,
you know all over Texas.
So you still do colleges.

1519
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.120
That's like a big debate with comics these days.

1520
01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:50.720
A lot of comedians don't want to do colleges anymore because it's just too

1521
01:27:50.721 --> 01:27:53.770
difficult.
Too much politically correct attitude.

1522
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:55.820
I don't really have a problem with it.

1523
01:27:55.821 --> 01:28:00.821
I really haven't had a problem before I go on a or sometimes before I agree to

1524
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:03.020
do it.
You know,
I asked them,
you know,

1525
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.200
if there's any restrictions and sometimes there's no restrictions at all.

1526
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:09.350
Sometimes there are these structured restrictions.

1527
01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:13.310
Well usually they never give it to you.
They'll be like,
well we want HBO.
Uh,

1528
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:17.270
no that's a SNL is fine but not HPL.
And I'm like,
what the fuck does that mean?

1529
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:20.790
Who says that to you?
Sometimes people running shows or whatever,
they'll be like,

1530
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:23.780
you'll be like,
uh,
you know,
rated higher but not rated X.
I'm like,

1531
01:28:23.781 --> 01:28:28.310
what the fuck does that mean?
You know,
I didn't go.
I need specifics.
Like I go,

1532
01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:32.900
can I say fuck,
can I say pussy?
Can I say I remember I did a show.

1533
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.340
This is like early on when I first started and it's part of like 91 or something

1534
01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:41.030
like that.
I did a show,
I think Christmas Zilli booked it.

1535
01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:44.410
Who owns Gotham Comedy Club in New York.
Good Dude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So he,

1536
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:48.150
he was booking a show that was way out in Brooklyn and,

1537
01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:50.750
and all Orthodox Jewish neighborhood.

1538
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.560
And it was a show where the rabbi is,

1539
01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:57.690
it was an Italian restaurant in Orthodox Jewish.
It was a kosher Italian,

1540
01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:00.500
like seafood restaurant.
I think it was a little seafood restaurant.

1541
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:02.340
How is that even possible?
Yeah,
so,

1542
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:07.140
<v 1>so everyone there is orthodox Jewish or even they had a fair amount of Hasidic</v>

1543
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:10.950
Jewish people there and the rabbis in the room and they had a sheet printed out

1544
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.790
of all the subjects in words you could and could not say.
It was like,

1545
01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:19.530
don't say Schmeichel,
don't,
don't say sex,
don't mention sex,

1546
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.710
you know,
all these fucking things.
You know,
I'm early on.
So it was like,

1547
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.530
I think it paid 25 bucks and you know,

1548
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.030
it's like an hour train ride out in the brook.
I'm like,
fuck it,

1549
01:29:27.031 --> 01:29:31.020
I'll do that shit.
So,
uh,
and it was,
you know,
it was not a good show,

1550
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:33.720
but I just remember that thing of how like,
okay,

1551
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:38.460
they spelled out every fucking thing that you could,
that you could not say.

1552
01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:41.730
So it was very clear.
So there's never a controversy,
right?

1553
01:29:41.731 --> 01:29:45.860
So when I find new a college,
I'm like,
what can I say?
You know,
what,
what,

1554
01:29:45.861 --> 01:29:48.900
what can I not say?
Can I,
can I do any jokes about a,

1555
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:51.120
cause I've done Catholic colleges,
you know,
can I do,

1556
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:55.260
can I do a joke about abortion?
Can I do joke about gay marriage?
You know,
I've,

1557
01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:59.130
I've some bits about gay marriage and you know,
that's with the Catholic church,

1558
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:01.970
that's a big thing.
So I'm like,
I'm like,

1559
01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:05.880
I need specifics on subject matter and words.
What is it?

1560
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:08.070
And I get that and then everything's fine,
you know,

1561
01:30:08.071 --> 01:30:10.860
but he's got to get that shit clean.
Is that fine with you right now?

1562
01:30:10.861 --> 01:30:13.170
Like if they give you a list right now and they said,
okay,
look,

1563
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:18.740
no summer pass on.
But what I passed on,
I can't remember.
I think,

1564
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:21.990
I think there was a Jewish gig I passed on because it was,
it was,
uh,

1565
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.360
I think it was just,
um,
I can't remember what it was,
but it was,
it was for some,

1566
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:31.590
it was a very specific group and it was just,
I knew there was like,

1567
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:34.830
there were like so many things you couldn't,
you'd have to give like this,

1568
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:37.620
you know,
they should've just had a kid playing the flute or something.

1569
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.110
I don't even have a fucking comedy show,
you know what I mean?
And have have,
uh,

1570
01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:44.160
some 10 year olds tap dance or something,
you know,
kosher place.

1571
01:30:44.161 --> 01:30:48.480
I wish you took a photo of the aisle.
I think I have it somewhere.
I,
I've,

1572
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.350
I have a pack rat,
so I'm hoping I have it somewhere.

1573
01:30:52.351 --> 01:30:55.050
I gotta look through my notes.
If you haven't emailed to my,

1574
01:30:55.051 --> 01:30:58.770
well put it up on Instagram.
But it was,
it was amazing.
That needs to be,

1575
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:03.750
that needs to be displayed.
But I understand that like even like when you do,

1576
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.280
you know,
if you're going,

1577
01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:08.580
if you're doing like even with late night talk shows on television,

1578
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:13.110
I will usually pass on doing stand up on those and if I can,

1579
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:17.700
I will do panel because in stand up they're going to,

1580
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.830
they're going to be so many things in my standup back that we're all,

1581
01:31:19.831 --> 01:31:21.700
I have to cut something.
Uh,

1582
01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:24.990
I'll have to not say a word or a certain subject matter and I'm like,

1583
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.430
I don't want to cut that out of my standup.

1584
01:31:26.431 --> 01:31:29.790
I don't want to censor my standup act adult like I want to do is zero censorship

1585
01:31:29.791 --> 01:31:30.360
with it.

1586
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.630
But if I'm doing panel and then wanting you to do some bits on the couch,

1587
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.840
it's a little bit of a different dynamic,
you know?
And it's like,
I'll,

1588
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:39.780
I'll more likely do that.

1589
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:45.240
I'd rather sensor there and do it in my standup act.
It's also interactive.
Right,

1590
01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:46.950
exactly.
So it's a little different.
Yeah.

1591
01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.980
And you're a guest on their show and these are their rules.

1592
01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:51.870
So if I know that going in,
I'm fine.

1593
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.290
But with those talk shows when they want you to like,
oh,

1594
01:31:55.291 --> 01:31:58.920
can you not say this word on that standard bid or not that seven among like fuck

1595
01:31:58.921 --> 01:32:02.100
it,
I'm out not doing it.
I'm not doing any censorship with my standup.

1596
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.420
Do you know that's why I was,
it would say like doing these shows.

1597
01:32:05.421 --> 01:32:08.410
So what the colleges will you,
yeah,
I'm sorry,
go ahead.
Go ahead.
No,

1598
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.810
that's all right.
Go ahead.
No,
they pay a lot.
You know,

1599
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.220
colleges pay well in general and I weigh it and I'm like,
all right,

1600
01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:19.170
if this is going to be at this,
this is what it is.
You know,

1601
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:24.180
like I did a show at Princeton a few years ago and this is a different issue and

1602
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:28.330
it was,
I mean,
a lot of the crowd was like a shitty audience.
They were like,

1603
01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:33.010
you know,
not all of them,
but a fair amount where very,
very spoiled,

1604
01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:36.130
very entitled and drunk as Shit and they're heckling.

1605
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:40.510
And normally I would just fucking destroy him.
But I'm like,

1606
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.530
if I heckle one of these kids and I fucking rip them to shreds,

1607
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:49.000
I'm in my head.
I'm thinking they're going to write a fucking ladder,
you know,

1608
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.550
and then then you know,
nasty letter saying,

1609
01:32:51.551 --> 01:32:54.010
oh you did all these things and then they're going to tell all these other

1610
01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:56.280
colleges and then I'll like just fucking stop working.
Um,

1611
01:32:56.470 --> 01:33:00.800
so I handled the heckler but not how I would normally,
how normally handle it.

1612
01:33:00.801 --> 01:33:04.690
That is why people don't want to get other colleges.
No,
I get it.

1613
01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:07.930
I get it 100%.
When people don't want to do that,
I eat,
I usually,

1614
01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:12.460
I usually find a way.
So in the law and the ones I've done this past year,

1615
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:16.150
I haven't had to censor anything that I do.
They've all been really good.

1616
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:18.160
So well that does happen.

1617
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:21.490
Dealing with a lot of people that don't have a lot of real life experience,

1618
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:25.570
they're very young.
I've often said stick a 50 year old janitor.

1619
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:30.370
We'll have a better sense of humor that a 19 year old Harvard student,
you know,

1620
01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.700
because you know,
first of all,
comedy Iq,

1621
01:33:33.701 --> 01:33:37.990
comedy smarts doesn't necessarily have anything to do with book smarts and real

1622
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:40.250
life experience is huge.
You know,

1623
01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:45.260
I sometimes I find college audiences to be almost more narrow minded that even

1624
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:49.300
someone in high school,
Oh,
somebody in high school,

1625
01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:52.630
even though there are a couple of years younger than someone in college,

1626
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:55.580
they don't have that because usually when people get to college,
they,

1627
01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.250
they kind of think they know everything.

1628
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:02.050
But in high school they don't think they know everything.
And college they do.

1629
01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.460
So it's like they can never be wrong.
Well,

1630
01:34:03.461 --> 01:34:06.090
they're ready to establish themselves as independent adults.

1631
01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.600
They're ready and they're ready to reinforce their ideas on you.
Excuse me.

1632
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.770
What you're saying is bullshit.
Yeah,
the patriarchy.
But I also,

1633
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.710
I also make fun of that Shit.
You know what I'll do colleges,
you know,

1634
01:34:17.711 --> 01:34:19.920
if that's you're coming up,
I make fun of that Shit,
you know?

1635
01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:23.930
So that shit is important to make fun of that.
That's a goddamn cancer thought.

1636
01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.820
Yeah.
Well that one cartoon in the book,
it really is,

1637
01:34:27.821 --> 01:34:31.000
it's like thought cancer is a disease.

1638
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:34.780
This disease of fake progressiveness.
It's not.

1639
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.470
It's really just calling people out on things and finding targets.
Well,

1640
01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.450
it's kind of like when a,
when a kid is young and he's first learning about,

1641
01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.420
you know,
curse words and 30 words,
he's just saying them constantly.

1642
01:34:46.421 --> 01:34:48.550
It doesn't even know what it means to sometimes when,

1643
01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.840
when people are trying to like stand up for something,
uh,

1644
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:56.080
and this is a new thing,
this activism is a new thing to them.

1645
01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:58.160
They don't really know.

1646
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:01.850
They may not be that good at it yet or like their heart might be in the right

1647
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:04.730
place,
but they're being misguided in their fucking shit up.
Yeah.

1648
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.750
That's a good way of putting it.
You know?
So that I think,
and then sometimes,

1649
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.220
and I,
this goes back to,

1650
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:14.150
we were talking about earlier where people never think they're wrong,
you know,

1651
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:16.190
and it's okay to be wrong,
you know,

1652
01:35:16.191 --> 01:35:18.950
like my opinions change on things over the years.

1653
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.630
And I enjoy listening to people.
Like I did a show in Columbus,

1654
01:35:23.631 --> 01:35:27.260
Ohio at a comedy club there,
I forget,
I think it's a funny bone or something.

1655
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.060
I did a show there.

1656
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.650
It was the weekend that the Trayvon Martin case was going on with George

1657
01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:38.150
Zimmerman.
And the,
uh,
I,
it was a show black jokes.

1658
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.500
No,
no,
but I've jokes about gun control,
you know,
and so,

1659
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:47.530
and it was the verdict came down that night and the show's going on and then the

1660
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:48.050
next day,

1661
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:52.310
and I still did buy bits about it and I'm talking to guys afterwards and there

1662
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:53.660
were a couple guys in the audience,

1663
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:57.800
a black guy and a white guy who are all super pro gun and they both work for the

1664
01:35:57.801 --> 01:36:00.560
biggest online gun seller and the country.

1665
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:03.710
And it was just very cool,
you know,

1666
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:08.330
talking with them afterwards and getting their insight as well as people who,

1667
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:12.710
uh,
you know,
one,
one,
you know,
strict gun control.
So it was just,
uh,

1668
01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.400
it's interesting,
you know,
usually things aren't,
you know,

1669
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:18.740
there are a lot more nuanced than you think they are and there's a lot of
issues.

1670
01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:23.870
I just did a gig in buffalo and the waiter at the comedy club,
uh,
it was like,

1671
01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:27.620
Hey,
I'm,
I'm,
we'll see tomorrow on Saturday cause hunting season starts tomorrow.

1672
01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:30.530
So me and my dad are driving out the woods and we're going to be hunting all
day.

1673
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:32.660
And then,
and then the,
uh,

1674
01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:36.890
the Uber driver who took me back to the airport was also hunting.

1675
01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:39.110
And then he was telling me all the rules they have in hunting.

1676
01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:42.920
Like bullets can only be a certain size and it can then your rifle,

1677
01:36:42.921 --> 01:36:44.450
you're only allowed to have three bullets in there.

1678
01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.460
You're not allowed to have five bullets in there.

1679
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.080
And it's got to be certain bullets that that,

1680
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:53.420
but like shoot through clean so they don't,
if you hit the the wrong place,

1681
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:55.150
it's not going to fuck up their whole leg.
You know,

1682
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.610
all this kind of things that you don't even realize that are out there.
You know,

1683
01:36:58.850 --> 01:37:01.970
boats are these,
well I think it's kind of like with fishing,

1684
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:05.810
like there's a lot of fishing laws where you put your hook,

1685
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:09.540
your hook is not allowed to have uh,
like those,
I forgot what they're called.

1686
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:12.490
Like the little daggers that go along the side.
Cause when you pull it out.
Dot.

1687
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:14.830
The barbs,
you don't want to do fuck on the fish shop.

1688
01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:18.170
This is for teching release places.
Right,
right.
That's what I'm talking about.

1689
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:20.660
There's no catch and release with bullets.
No,

1690
01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:23.600
but there was something he was saying about,
but it was a civil,

1691
01:37:23.601 --> 01:37:27.620
it was a similar dynamic with with the catch and release stuff with the hook

1692
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:31.010
hollow point bullets if that's what they mean.

1693
01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:32.750
But those are mostly for pistols anyway.

1694
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:38.090
There's lead ammo versus Copper Ama Wilk.
Really the impact is environmental.

1695
01:37:38.091 --> 01:37:41.960
They're worried about birds eating.
Okay.
That's an issue.
Right.
Okay.

1696
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:45.830
But what you're saying are things that most people don't even know exist,

1697
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:50.720
you know,
which is part of the conversation in gun control.
You know,
that's,

1698
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:54.530
that's I think the gun control conversation in the hunting conversation are very

1699
01:37:54.531 --> 01:37:56.040
different.
I think what

1700
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.010
<v 2>people are really concerned about when it comes to gun control are quote unquote</v>

1701
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.690
assault weapons.
Worried about like what happened in San Bernardino.

1702
01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:06.300
Somebody having large magazines,
semiautomatic weapons,

1703
01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.620
killing a bunch of people in,
you know,

1704
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:13.380
cities versus suburbs and rural places.
It's totally different.
Sure.

1705
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.100
If in a,
if a rural area and people are like,
will everyone owns guns?

1706
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:21.270
That's a hell of a lot different than if you're in a city and in one block you

1707
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:25.650
have 10,000 people living,
right?
If you have 10,000 guns,
you know,

1708
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.920
within 30 yards,
that's a lot of fucking guns.

1709
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:34.200
That's a different dynamic.
And you know,
so I don't know all the answers.

1710
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.720
I feel like one of the things you were talking about earlier about like these

1711
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:38.940
people that are activists that really have their heart in the right place,

1712
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:40.230
they just learning how to do it right.

1713
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:44.820
I think that that Q could say that overall about what's going on with the

1714
01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:45.631
Internet in general.

1715
01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:49.450
I think one of the big problems that people are having right now with um,

1716
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:54.890
progressive thinking and what people are calling regressive but po regressive

1717
01:38:55.681 --> 01:39:00.640
left.
Like people that are like very overly PC and trying to reinforce.

1718
01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:04.860
I think what we're trying to do is make the world a little bit better and a

1719
01:39:04.861 --> 01:39:08.280
little bit safer and a little bit more open minded.
But along the way,

1720
01:39:08.281 --> 01:39:11.160
he's going to be a lot of stumbling blocks and this is going to be a lot of poor

1721
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:15.050
representations of these ideas.
And you see it from the right to,
I mean with,

1722
01:39:15.051 --> 01:39:17.800
with Trump and some of the things he's saying,
it's like,
you know,
he's,

1723
01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.080
some of these things are so caring.
Cartoonish.
Yeah.
But,
but everyone,

1724
01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:24.450
but even like what he's doing is similar.

1725
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:27.930
What happens is sometimes on the left where everyone is so confident about their

1726
01:39:27.931 --> 01:39:31.830
idea and they think this is the only way,
and it's like,

1727
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.700
it's usually a lot more complex than that.
Yeah.
Almost always.

1728
01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:38.490
Almost always more complex than that.
There's a lot going on.

1729
01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:43.650
There's a lot going on with human interaction and I think ultimately like we

1730
01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:46.290
should probably try to leave people alone as much as possible.

1731
01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:48.270
Let people do their own thing as much as possible,

1732
01:39:48.271 --> 01:39:51.050
as long as what they're own thing is,
isn't an interfering with other people.

1733
01:39:51.051 --> 01:39:55.890
Still agree 100% that way.
When someone,
something like radical ideology,

1734
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:58.220
like Islam extreme,
you know,

1735
01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:01.860
Muslim terrorist type characters that are doing what they did in San Bernandino

1736
01:40:01.861 --> 01:40:03.600
and these other places,
you got to go,
okay,

1737
01:40:03.601 --> 01:40:07.260
well now it's a problem because now you know someone has stepped in and killed a

1738
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:10.140
bunch of people and they've done it with guns.
So we have these issues,

1739
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:12.640
we have these issues of radical ideologies and the,

1740
01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:16.290
we have these issues of guns and we also have mental health issues.

1741
01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:17.311
That's a big one.

1742
01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:22.311
That one drives me fucking crazy that every time someone is a mass shooter and

1743
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:25.950
kills a bunch of people,
the gun control issue comes up over and over again.

1744
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:27.810
But what about the fucking mental health issue?

1745
01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:32.280
Because the mental health issue is as big an issue as anything else.

1746
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:35.640
There's a lot of people in this world with guns is more guns in this country

1747
01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:38.310
than there are people.
But relatively speaking,

1748
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.210
there's very few mass shootings when you consider the amount of human beings.

1749
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.350
So what the fuck is it that makes people pop?
Yeah,
I dunno.
I mean,
I've,

1750
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:51.380
the stuff I've read recently says that gun shootings in general now are lower

1751
01:40:52.261 --> 01:40:56.380
than they were 10 or 20 years ago,
but mass shootings are up.
Yeah.
You know,

1752
01:40:56.490 --> 01:41:00.370
a murderer is down.
Murders did the lowest murder rates.

1753
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:01.870
I tweeted this the other day,

1754
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:07.150
lower than they have been in the last 50 years and maybe even ever interesting.

1755
01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:11.350
But mass shootings,
there's more of them.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Uh,

1756
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.160
all of us,
I don't know all the reasons.
I don't think anybody knows.

1757
01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.990
They also get publicized.
Now we're in a like a very instantaneous way.

1758
01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:22.360
Social media,
Twitter.
I mean,

1759
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:24.370
I remember when the San Bernardino thing was happening,
my,

1760
01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:27.520
I just started seeing tweets.
Yeah.
If there was the first thing,
you know,

1761
01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:30.160
he just immediately get,
oh my God,
something's happening in San Bernardino.

1762
01:41:30.161 --> 01:41:33.890
What's going on?
Hashtag San Bernardino.
It's trending.
Trending.

1763
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:37.330
Trending is a weird word,
right?
Yeah.
That's very,
we don't want to be trending.

1764
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:41.350
Going to be trending now.
Judah,
Judah,
world champion,

1765
01:41:41.351 --> 01:41:45.560
Hashtag Judah world champions.
That was trending.
Yeah.
That's not bad.
Yeah.

1766
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:50.650
Judah world champion rape case.
Nah,
that's not good.

1767
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:56.140
Not good,
but know that know all that,
you know,

1768
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:57.880
I don't know all the answers to them.
Nobody does.

1769
01:41:57.881 --> 01:42:02.881
But that's the reality is nobody knows that it needs to be discussed and with an

1770
01:42:03.821 --> 01:42:08.680
open mind and intelligently and people need to hear other people's ideas,

1771
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.620
all sides.
You know,
it's so,
so,

1772
01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.980
but you know what's fascinating when a mass shooting happens,

1773
01:42:14.981 --> 01:42:19.150
one of the big winners is the gun had been business.
The gun industry.
Oh,

1774
01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:21.910
their sales go through the roof through the roof because everybody's scared that

1775
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:23.400
the government's going to take the guns.
Yeah.

1776
01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.720
So everybody starts buying guns and those guns salesman in,
uh,

1777
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:32.030
in Ohio on that kick that they were said through the roof,
you know?
Yeah.

1778
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:33.250
It's also the,

1779
01:42:33.251 --> 01:42:36.310
they always like to point out that those things don't happen very often in

1780
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:39.960
places where you have open carry as places where anybody can have a gun,

1781
01:42:39.970 --> 01:42:41.290
you can take a gun anywhere you want.

1782
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:45.540
It's very rare that you have these interest mass shootings.
But I mean,

1783
01:42:45.541 --> 01:42:48.400
if there is a mass shooter,
if there's someone that's shooting people,

1784
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:50.080
what do you want?

1785
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:53.200
Do you want everyone to be unarmed or do you want everyone to be armed and just

1786
01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:56.860
having fucking crazy gunfights yeah,
like what is the answer?

1787
01:42:56.861 --> 01:42:58.340
I don't know what the answer is.
Yes.
I mean,

1788
01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:01.690
do you really want to live in a society where everyone has to carry a gun?

1789
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:07.120
Walking into Walmart with a fucking ar?
You want to give all headlight?
Yeah.

1790
01:43:07.121 --> 01:43:10.630
At what age would you be required to have a gun?
You know,

1791
01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:14.380
is it like when you get your driver's test at 15 or 16 is that when you get your

1792
01:43:14.381 --> 01:43:17.500
gun also or do you get your gun when you're six but that's another problem is

1793
01:43:17.501 --> 01:43:21.520
how easy it is to get a gun as opposed to how easy it is to learn how to drive a

1794
01:43:21.521 --> 01:43:23.230
car.
If you're driving a car,

1795
01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:26.970
you have to go through a lot of hoops and you have to learn has a should be,

1796
01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.220
you don't have to do that with a gun.
That's a problem.
It's a real problem.

1797
01:43:30.221 --> 01:43:32.550
You don't have to show competency.
You don't have to,
you know,

1798
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:35.170
they don't have to test you on your marksmanship or any of that.

1799
01:43:35.171 --> 01:43:38.740
I think cold bear did just did a thing the other night saying it's you have to

1800
01:43:38.741 --> 01:43:42.760
show more id to get sudafed than to get a gun.

1801
01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:46.630
Especially ammo.
There's more restrictions on sudafed than there are an ammo.

1802
01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.320
That's what it was.
That's what it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what it was.
Yeah.

1803
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:51.980
I had to buy some recently and when I bought

1804
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.920
<v 0>it or they had to get,
they had to get my id and I was like,
what?</v>

1805
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:59.270
Like you have to write down someone's Id when you buy sudafed and that never

1806
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:03.840
used to be that way.
Just go buy sudafed.
Oh yeah,
totally make a,

1807
01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:08.490
that's what we need to do.
Go back to the ace.
No Internet.
Everyone was still,

1808
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.090
the Internet's the fucking problem.
Yeah.

1809
01:44:11.091 --> 01:44:14.570
The Internet has recipes for how to make meth from cold syrup.
Yeah.

1810
01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.130
Remember when you started doing comedy,

1811
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:18.800
did you ever think you were gonna have to be doing tweets and shit like that?

1812
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:22.850
We were talking about that before the show.
We were both tweeting,
but yeah,
no,

1813
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:26.960
I mean it's,
it's a prerequisite.
If you want to be a successful touring comedian,

1814
01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:29.900
you have to tweet,
you have to Facebook,
you have to do,
I do three things,

1815
01:44:29.901 --> 01:44:31.970
Facebook,
tweet,
Instagram.
Those are my three things.

1816
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:36.020
I don't really do Facebook anymore.
I just couldn't.
I just kind of,

1817
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.890
I did Instagram,
Twitter,
I just started doing periscope a little bit,

1818
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.790
but I gave up on periscope.
Usually I've done a few in each one.

1819
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:48.650
It was me on the road like in a city and I have no car so I'm just like walking

1820
01:44:48.651 --> 01:44:53.651
a mile to like the closest like cvs or gas station supermarket to buy some

1821
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:56.240
groceries.
So like,
so the 20 minute walk I'll be like,
all right,

1822
01:44:56.241 --> 01:44:59.680
I'll just fucking periscope this shit.
Why don't you just rent a car then?

1823
01:44:59.681 --> 01:45:03.200
It's a good point.
But then I'm not really going anywhere,
you know,
go places.

1824
01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:03.921
Not really.

1825
01:45:03.921 --> 01:45:07.070
Cause I usually on the road it's like I have to get up early to do morning
radio.

1826
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:09.020
I got shows late at night and I'm just,

1827
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:11.060
I'm usually too tired to do anything during the day.

1828
01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:15.140
Why don't you take some vitamins,
eat some healthy food.
I do eat healthy food.
No,

1829
01:45:15.141 --> 01:45:17.210
I eat healthy food.
I don't do vitamins.
By do healthy food.

1830
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:21.260
When you're on the road,
you bring your own openers.
Not usually.

1831
01:45:21.261 --> 01:45:23.480
I'm not at that point in my career where I can really,

1832
01:45:23.481 --> 01:45:26.300
I'm not making enough money where I can do that.
You know?

1833
01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:31.430
I need to get up like another rung on the ladder and then I can be doing that.

1834
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:35.030
I think I'm like just full television show though.
I know,

1835
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:39.920
but I never translated anything into successful business.
Just,

1836
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:44.180
yeah,
just didn't do it.
I don't know.
I'm just not a good business person.

1837
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.500
You know?
It's like I remember her,

1838
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:50.790
like I remember doing this one show,
like a,

1839
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.040
it was a road show and a bunch of comics were on it and like there's two comics

1840
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:55.700
who were like,

1841
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:59.080
they didn't even have the better of the sets and they're selling tee shirts that

1842
01:45:59.081 --> 01:46:03.060
got their cds or selling left and right.
And me and a lot of color,
like,
you know,

1843
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:06.420
no one's even talking to us,
you know,
and we had great sets.
But yeah,
I'm,

1844
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:07.263
that's not,
I don't know.

1845
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:10.820
I've never been good at selling stuff or organization or anything like that.

1846
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:14.780
Yeah.
We just see you just go on the road doing your thing,

1847
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:17.770
getting the fuck out of there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I tried,

1848
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:22.790
I'm trying to like get to see the cities more and learn about it more instead of

1849
01:46:22.821 --> 01:46:24.480
just going in and out,
you know,

1850
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:27.320
you're looking to do more TV or just looking to do more standup now?

1851
01:46:27.321 --> 01:46:29.910
Like what are you trying to do?
Well that's a,

1852
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:34.200
I think I'm going to stand up has always been my main thing and still is.
Um,

1853
01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:38.450
I spent most of the last year,
uh,
when 30 rock ended,

1854
01:46:38.451 --> 01:46:43.430
actually I,
I stopped,
uh,
I didn't even have an acting agent.

1855
01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.510
I uh,
I and I wasn't looking for one and I haven't had an acting agent about two

1856
01:46:47.511 --> 01:46:50.280
years.
Uh,
when 30 rock I,
I just wanted to hit the road

1857
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:53.280
<v 1>and tour cause I was still doing tons of stand up.
I'll do in 30 rock,</v>

1858
01:46:53.281 --> 01:46:58.020
but I wasn't allowed to do go on the road much cause we were filming in the
city,

1859
01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:00.570
so you know,
like eight or nine months out of the year.

1860
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.970
So I just went on the road and that's all I wanted to do.

1861
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:07.770
And then with the sort of constant sleep deprivation of traveling and you know,

1862
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:09.840
morning radio and morning TV shows,

1863
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.920
I started actually drawing again and that's when I started the book sort of like

1864
01:47:13.921 --> 01:47:15.060
came out of that,
you know,

1865
01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:19.290
after several months I realized I had like 50 cartoons and I was like,
wow,

1866
01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:22.950
I think I'm working on a new book here.
And so I wasn't planning on that.

1867
01:47:22.951 --> 01:47:24.840
That's just kind of organically came to me.

1868
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:28.170
So I spent the past most of the past year,
a year and a half working on that.

1869
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.220
And then doing standup,

1870
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.180
I turned down a fair amount of acting stuff that came my way.
Um,

1871
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.970
and now the next big project I need to do as a stand up project.
Uh,

1872
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.980
but there will be a special or a 90 minute feature length standup concert film.

1873
01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:44.340
Uh,
and then I'll do an album with it because I still have never put one out.

1874
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:46.830
You know,
I probably shouldn't,
nothing.

1875
01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.770
I should have had probably five out by now.
Years ago.

1876
01:47:49.771 --> 01:47:53.550
I turned him down from comedy central because I always,
well this was,

1877
01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:55.350
this is probably like 10,
15 years ago,

1878
01:47:55.351 --> 01:47:58.980
I turned them down because of their censorship stuff.
I didn't,

1879
01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.030
now they're much looser with it.
Obviously they looser.
But then it was like,

1880
01:48:03.031 --> 01:48:05.670
there were subjects you couldn't talk about a lot of words you couldn't say.

1881
01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:06.870
And I'm like,
fucking,
I'm not doing it.

1882
01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:10.470
And I also never liked their ownership clauses where they owned,

1883
01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:12.750
they didn't just own that film.
The footage of you,

1884
01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:16.020
they owned all the writing and it also,
you know,
so if I wanted to,

1885
01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:17.130
if I wanted to do,

1886
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:21.180
let's say I had one joke from there and then I wanted to do that on my own
album,

1887
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:26.090
uh,
but I've like one line,
but I've added three new lines to it.

1888
01:48:26.091 --> 01:48:26.924
And you know,

1889
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.790
they either wouldn't allow you or you'd have to get lawyers and fucking get

1890
01:48:29.791 --> 01:48:31.050
permission.
So I was like fuck it.

1891
01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:35.580
So and then I've been trying to make my own for the past couple of years and

1892
01:48:35.581 --> 01:48:40.581
then this book project sort of presented itself and then uh,

1893
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:44.520
the,
so the,
at this point the only thing stopping me is May.
So,

1894
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:47.940
and I think I have so much material I know I can put out,

1895
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:52.830
I think what I'm going to do is just put out my recent most recent hour.

1896
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:54.510
But yeah,
I can,
I can put out,

1897
01:48:54.511 --> 01:48:58.260
I can go back the material I don't even do anymore and then put out probably two

1898
01:48:58.261 --> 01:49:00.430
or three others,
you know?
Yeah you should do that.

1899
01:49:00.431 --> 01:49:04.760
And you should just bang out like three specials in a year.
I might do that.
Yeah.

1900
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:08.160
Or maybe one or one special and then two other albums or something.

1901
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.210
Cause it's so important if people want to go see you that they can see something

1902
01:49:12.211 --> 01:49:16.160
online.
Yeah.
Find something that day.
Netflix along those lines.

1903
01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.760
Some clips online.
That's it.

1904
01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:20.880
But I don't have like any of the half hour hour stuff cause I always turn that

1905
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:23.310
down.
I think a lot of it was fear based too,

1906
01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:27.600
because I also have a lot of trust issues with people.
Like trust me,
I do,

1907
01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:32.640
I do trust jr I'm trusting anything.
No,
but no,
I respect you and trust you.

1908
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:37.440
Um,
but it's like,
I,
um,
you know,
so I have a lot of trust issues,

1909
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:42.300
period,
you know,
and then some of it's because I've been fucked over a lot,

1910
01:49:42.301 --> 01:49:47.060
but that's okay.
But then there's also the,
my own perfectionism,
it's like,
it's,

1911
01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.650
it's like,
oh,
as soon as you tape it,
then I'm going to think,
oh,

1912
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:54.400
I have this one other junk that goes on to that one.
We want it in there.

1913
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:57.370
I want the,
I want it perfect.
And he got,
you can't aim for perfect.

1914
01:49:57.371 --> 01:50:00.010
You got to just go with what you got at that time.

1915
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:01.420
And that's what that show represents.

1916
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.760
It's gotta be a representation of what you're doing right now in this one time

1917
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:09.820
where,
this is filmed,
example,
December of 2015.

1918
01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:14.590
Bambling this is Judah Freelander Bam,
this,
it exactly.
But it's,

1919
01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:16.300
it's hard to do that.
It's hard.

1920
01:50:16.301 --> 01:50:20.650
It's hard to nail it like that and locking in and,
and then not say,
ah,

1921
01:50:20.670 --> 01:50:24.100
but I could've done this.
I should have edited that out.
And that part was flat,

1922
01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.390
right.
Take chances.

1923
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:30.880
And then the other like blockage of my own area of mental blockage was,

1924
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:34.990
uh,
I'd,
I'd much better with that now,
but for a few years ago,

1925
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.130
I used to never have it.

1926
01:50:36.131 --> 01:50:40.900
Then a few years ago it kicked in was like that fear of like,
you know,

1927
01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:45.280
basic little like not just trolls but like,
you know,
bloggers saying,

1928
01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:48.500
oh this shit son.
Like they are going to shit on it.
And then,
cause you know,

1929
01:50:48.501 --> 01:50:51.050
if so many people,
like,
like if one blog says you,

1930
01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:54.730
you stink than all the other ones are just going to basically rewrite that one

1931
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.280
and then write the same fucking article.
And then before you know it,

1932
01:50:57.281 --> 01:50:59.620
you have all the fucking Internet saying you stink.

1933
01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:02.470
Or like the whole hipster half of the Internet saying,
you suck.

1934
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:06.730
So I never used to give a shit what people think,
but at some point,

1935
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:11.910
several years ago,
that kind of happened to me.
So I was like,
it did happen.
Yeah,

1936
01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.340
it did it.
Whereas it's just constantly like I got a lot of anxiety,

1937
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:18.420
like thinking if I put something out,
they're going to shit on it and never went,

1938
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:20.710
wait a minute,
so I'm going to suck and then I'm not gonna have a career.

1939
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:24.220
Know this happened because someone shit on you or you were worried about someone

1940
01:51:24.221 --> 01:51:27.520
shitting on you?
I was worried about it.
Yeah,
I was looking at her happened.
No,

1941
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:30.010
well no,
I've,
I've had,
I've had reviews where people like,

1942
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.210
like just completely shit on me and it's all,

1943
01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.190
none of it's factual,
you know what I mean?

1944
01:51:36.191 --> 01:51:39.970
It's basically like a professional troll,
you know?
Uh,
but,

1945
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:43.190
and you're always going to have that though,
man.
Yeah,
I know.
Yeah.

1946
01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:47.050
I've gotten much better with like not worrying about that shit,
but for,
you know,

1947
01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:51.310
three,
four years,
three,
four years ago I was,
I was having that really bad,

1948
01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:54.000
you know,
and I don't know what it was.
I,

1949
01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.690
I think it was all kinds of trust issues,

1950
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:59.080
trust issues I was having personally and stuff.

1951
01:51:59.081 --> 01:52:01.720
Cause I remember like when 30 rock was going on,

1952
01:52:02.230 --> 01:52:06.790
I'd go out on a date with a girl and then like 30 minutes in the date,

1953
01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.300
um,
she starts talking about her boyfriend and I'm like,
whoa.
I'm like,

1954
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:13.720
what are you talking about?
And she's like,
Oh,
I thought we were just,
you know,

1955
01:52:13.721 --> 01:52:17.290
going out for dinner on like friends.
And I'm like,
I'm like,
I asked you out,

1956
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:22.030
it's Saturday night.
And I'm like,
so,
so I go to like,
are you like,
are you,

1957
01:52:22.450 --> 01:52:25.030
are you cheating on your boyfriend and you're not in them anymore?
Like he is,

1958
01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:28.510
he had a town or you guys have an open relationship.
She's like,
no,
he's here.

1959
01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.860
I'm like,
well where is he?
And she's like,
I got the apartment.
I'm like,

1960
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.380
well fucking go.
Damn.
What the fuck you doing over here with me?

1961
01:52:35.410 --> 01:52:38.260
You know how many times this happened?
That happened a few times.

1962
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:41.650
Where like where girls would like want to like go out with me just to take

1963
01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:46.010
pictures so they can like tell their Facebook friends.
Oh,
so they

1964
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.880
<v 2>became friends with you because you were on television.
Exactly.</v>

1965
01:52:49.881 --> 01:52:53.990
So that romantically interested in you?
I think when that stuff was happening,

1966
01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.070
that's also,
I don't know,
I'm just guessing here.
I don't have the exact answers,

1967
01:52:58.130 --> 01:52:59.150
I'm just thinking out loud.

1968
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:02.960
But I think that's maybe sort of around the same time when I started worrying

1969
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:06.580
about like bloggers and shit,
like shitting on,
you know,
my friend,
uh,

1970
01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:11.680
Eddie has this theory about bill Cosby and about a bill Cosby when he started

1971
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:17.570
doing that to women and he thinks that that might've been the similar type of

1972
01:53:17.571 --> 01:53:20.030
situation where these women wanted to be around him,

1973
01:53:20.031 --> 01:53:23.660
but they were turning him down.
Okay,
Gotcha.
And he started drugging them,

1974
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:27.950
then he started raping him.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I never did that.
I just left.
Yeah.

1975
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:32.690
You're much better man than him.
But you know what I mean?
Like,
no,
that just,

1976
01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.650
that can happen where someone's attracted to you simply because you're a famous

1977
01:53:36.651 --> 01:53:40.930
person or hey,
this is a girl that I'm romantically interested in it.

1978
01:53:40.931 --> 01:53:45.140
I'd like to go anyway.
And they say,
yeah,
then you're at dinner.
So fucked up.

1979
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:48.050
Fuck man.
So you're,
you're talking to this girl,
you go,
Hey,

1980
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:50.950
do you want to go out to dinner?
And she's like,
yeah,
that sounds good.
Yeah,
yeah,

1981
01:53:51.250 --> 01:53:54.320
yeah.
And then all of a sudden you're on a date and just telling you about her

1982
01:53:54.321 --> 01:53:58.760
boyfriend.
Saturday,
it's 10 o'clock.
Yeah.
And you're thinking,
yeah,
look at you.

1983
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:03.690
I'm
just going to get some all right.

1984
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.900
And she's like,
yeah,
my boyfriend's waiting for me.

1985
01:54:06.190 --> 01:54:08.740
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
that,
she just casually mentioned him about something.
Oh yeah,</v>

1986
01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:11.480
my boyfriend and this or something.
I'm like,
Huh?
What?
Yeah.

1987
01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:15.220
And this happened more than once.
Yeah.
I remember one girl,

1988
01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:20.260
I remember one girl.
What did she,
I'm trying remember what she wanted to do.
No,

1989
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.820
no,
she wanted to,

1990
01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.100
it was something like buy jewelry now.
I can't remember.
I think I was,

1991
01:54:27.101 --> 01:54:28.630
it was time out New York magazine,

1992
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:32.110
they put me on the front cover of their like dating issue and they're,

1993
01:54:32.130 --> 01:54:35.140
they're like a holy spout dating and they headed thing of the on the thread said

1994
01:54:35.141 --> 01:54:38.890
like date this guide.
I'm like,
I'm like on the cover.
They like,
oh,
I'm fucking in.

1995
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.360
Yeah.
So,
and I remember one girl I think saw that and then she,

1996
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:46.540
she liked Facebook,
me or something like that and was saying low.

1997
01:54:46.541 --> 01:54:51.460
She wants to meet me and the southern.
So she wanted to go,
she wanted to go,

1998
01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:53.650
she wanted to write articles.

1999
01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:57.670
She wanted to follow me on a date and then write an article about it.

2000
01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.010
That that's what she wanted to do.
And I'm like,

2001
01:55:00.011 --> 01:55:02.530
why the fuck would anyone want to do that and why would I want to fucking do

2002
01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:03.364
that?
It's like

2003
01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:06.550
<v 2>I wouldn't want state wants you to meet a random girl,</v>

2004
01:55:06.551 --> 01:55:09.430
go on a date with her and she's going to hang out with you guys.
Cause

2005
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:12.160
<v 1>she wants to get a cause.
She's like an aspiring writer,</v>

2006
01:55:12.161 --> 01:55:14.940
so she wants to try to get,
you know,
articles written online.

2007
01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.970
So her way to do is to latch onto a famous person.
Right.
So there's always,

2008
01:55:18.971 --> 01:55:23.190
you know,
that kind of Shit,
you know.
So I uh,
and I had no,

2009
01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:26.140
and before any of that shit,
I always said trust issues with people.

2010
01:55:26.141 --> 01:55:28.540
So then that would make it even,
where's your trust issues come from?

2011
01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.400
If you are going to be doctor.
No.
Yeah.
I don't know.

2012
01:55:30.401 --> 01:55:33.340
I don't know what a psychologist does is always your whole life you've had this.

2013
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:35.830
Yeah.
I don't know.
Always with authority figures.

2014
01:55:35.831 --> 01:55:39.730
I've never gotten along pretty much in a new consider women authority figures.

2015
01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:44.190
No,
no.
That's just,
you know,
it's just a relationship.
So how many different

2016
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:46.230
<v 0>girls did that to you when you went on dates with him and they said they had</v>

2017
01:55:46.231 --> 01:55:50.230
boyfriends while there's that one I can think of.
Uh,

2018
01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.910
it probably happened like two or three times.
That's really weird.
Yeah,

2019
01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:56.970
that's super unusual.
But also,

2020
01:55:56.971 --> 01:56:00.030
but it'll happen after shows all the time where a girl would be really flirted

2021
01:56:00.031 --> 01:56:02.070
with you at another company.
Like,
dude,
you should jump on that.

2022
01:56:02.071 --> 01:56:05.370
I'm like her boyfriend's right there,
you know?
Yeah.
It's like,
you know,

2023
01:56:05.371 --> 01:56:07.920
she'll be flirty with me.
And I remember one time,

2024
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:11.160
one girl was like taking her shirt off,
showing her boobs,

2025
01:56:11.161 --> 01:56:14.520
hope me and God freer there.
This outside of the seller and a,

2026
01:56:14.521 --> 01:56:15.540
her boyfriend's right there.

2027
01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:19.740
He's taking photos of us doing it and stuff and other freaks.
Yeah.
You know,

2028
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:21.830
some people are just that way,
you know,
and other people are going to do,

2029
01:56:21.831 --> 01:56:24.240
do you guys should go with that governor?
Like her boyfriend's taking the photos?

2030
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:26.880
No,
I'm not going to fucking,
there's always gonna be people like that.

2031
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:27.743
People that,
yeah.

2032
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:33.120
I have a friend of mine that went with this girl and the girl told him that she

2033
01:56:33.511 --> 01:56:38.511
had a husband and the husband watched and coached her while she was blowing my

2034
01:56:39.751 --> 01:56:44.340
friend.
That's,
that's really weird.
Shit.
Deep.
That's the shit.

2035
01:56:44.341 --> 01:56:48.570
I don't want to get involved with deep weird pool.
Yeah.
I don't do that.
Yeah,

2036
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:51.840
I was saying to him,
I said,
how did that feel?
Gay?
She's like,

2037
01:56:51.841 --> 01:56:55.470
he's directing your pleasure.
The whole thing range.
That's just bizarre,

2038
01:56:55.471 --> 01:56:59.970
that whole thing.
But some people are into bizarre shit like that,
man.
Not me.
No,

2039
01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:04.320
no.
Some people are into weird shit though,
you know,
but I don't know.
I think,

2040
01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.940
you know,
so much of culture is so,
uh,
like,

2041
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:12.810
like even if you look at social media,
Instagram,
Facebook,
Twitter.

2042
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.640
If I wasn't trying to promote my shows,
I wouldn't be on any of that shit.
Right.

2043
01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.950
Yet.
Everyone's on that shit.
That's a good point.
You know,

2044
01:57:19.951 --> 01:57:21.000
like why are they on it?

2045
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:25.420
Like if you're on it and you just want to follow different people sort of get,

2046
01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:29.490
you know,
get some like you know,
ongoing kind of entertainment,
you know.

2047
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:30.623
But it's like,

2048
01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.300
like when people just take photos of them selves at the beach or their food and

2049
01:57:36.301 --> 01:57:39.270
they posted,
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?
What's the point?

2050
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:41.610
That's a really good point.
I've,
you know,

2051
01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:44.640
I don't think I've really thought about that.
Like I get why we're on it.

2052
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:48.330
I don't get what anyone else is on it cause I've been in entertainment for so

2053
01:57:48.331 --> 01:57:51.270
long and social media is just something that sort of came along the way.

2054
01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:55.500
What would I be doing?
Would I be even using if,
if I don't think I would know.

2055
01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:58.130
I got into my space to promote gigs I got,

2056
01:57:58.131 --> 01:58:01.600
I mean to Facebook for the same and 12 same.

2057
01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:05.460
That's really interesting.
And the Instagram,
same thing.

2058
01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.650
Like I know some people and they just follow,

2059
01:58:07.651 --> 01:58:11.970
they'll follow like their favorite like musicians and their favorite comics and

2060
01:58:11.971 --> 01:58:13.350
there,
you know,
so they're on their scroll.

2061
01:58:13.351 --> 01:58:17.400
They're getting some info and entertainment like throughout the day.

2062
01:58:17.401 --> 01:58:21.720
I understand that,
but,
but if you're actively posting,
I don't,
I don't,

2063
01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.830
I don't know if you know what?

2064
01:58:22.831 --> 01:58:24.780
It's almost like everyone has their own show basically.

2065
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.990
That's what the world's become.
Everyone's has their own shower,

2066
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.670
their own reality show.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is what it's like.
So,
yeah.

2067
01:58:31.770 --> 01:58:34.490
I'm sorry,
go ahead.
Go ahead.
No,
please.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
If you're in the show,
no,

2068
01:58:34.491 --> 01:58:38.640
no,
no.
I've,
you don't have to wait time.
It's all right man.
It's just in bed.

2069
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:42.310
Who were you saying don't feel bad when we saying all if a girl,

2070
01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:45.460
<v 2>like some of those girls,
like from a few years ago,
it was like,</v>

2071
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:50.750
it was almost like,
you know,
the date was me guest starring on their jazz.

2072
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:54.230
Exactly.
You know,
and I can maybe get them ratings,
you know,

2073
01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.540
that's a whole bunch of likes on their photos.
That's what it was like.
You know,

2074
01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:03.760
I went with the guy from 30 rock gets me thought he was going to get laid.
Ha Ha,

2075
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:06.760
lol.
I don't,
sometimes I don't even think they're thinking that.
Like,

2076
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.740
I don't even think that occurs to them sometimes.
What other dumb,

2077
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:16.270
well,
I don't know.
I think they're just so into like,
oh,
this'll give me,

2078
01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:19.030
people are going to like this photo.
They're not thinking.

2079
01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:22.330
I don't know that they all actually think it affects you as a person.

2080
01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:26.140
So it's like trolls don't think it affects you as a person often.
You know?

2081
01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.180
They're just like,
they're,
you know,
they're just talking shit.

2082
01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.370
They're just not thinking about it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2083
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.460
They're just using you as a target for their anchor.
Right,
right.

2084
01:59:33.461 --> 01:59:37.120
They don't view you as a human for the girl she's using.
Use the target.

2085
01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:40.360
You're a celebrity.
You're on a television show that she enjoys.
Look,

2086
01:59:40.361 --> 01:59:44.320
I'm here with him.
The guy from the thing,
I'm amazing.
I'm amazing.

2087
01:59:44.321 --> 01:59:48.610
I made magic happen.
The guy from the boxes is,
and he paid for my food.

2088
01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:51.640
It's a perfect impression.
Is that what she sounded like?
Perfect.

2089
01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.490
And then my boyfriend's has and then my boyfriend's has and he doesn't like you.

2090
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.130
I don't know why.
I never,
whenever he goes you'll be like,
oh yeah,

2091
01:59:57.131 --> 02:00:00.070
he likes you too.
Yeah.
But when you,
did you ask them,

2092
02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:03.810
does your boyfriend know that we're going to dinner together?
Not One time I did.

2093
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:07.270
She say she just,
she had nothing to say.
Oh God.

2094
02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:11.490
So just end the date right there and get out of there.
Uh,
no,

2095
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:13.060
I finished my food,
you know,

2096
02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.330
I think it lasted a little bit longer than just kind of like awkward and Shit.

2097
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.200
Yeah,
it was pretty lame.
Yeah.
How'd you guys,
end of the night?
He's a hugger.

2098
02:00:21.250 --> 02:00:25.120
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
How could you not remember what's it?

2099
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:28.000
How could you not remember that?
I don't remember.
You know,
I don't,

2100
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:31.810
I don't remember how it happened.
I just don't fucking know.
You know,
the,

2101
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:35.230
the idea that everyone has their own show is exactly what's going on.

2102
02:00:35.231 --> 02:00:39.880
And that's also when you see these like really self righteous tweets that people

2103
02:00:39.881 --> 02:00:42.280
put out.
Like,
what are they really doing?

2104
02:00:42.281 --> 02:00:45.700
They're doing exactly the same thing that you see people doing on reality shows

2105
02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:48.670
where there they're fucking acting.
You know?

2106
02:00:48.671 --> 02:00:51.470
You know when you watch a reality show and you watch someone there,

2107
02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:55.330
they're doing something or saying something very specifically to get a reaction,

2108
02:00:55.331 --> 02:00:58.450
whether it's,
I don't watch them,
but yeah,
I get what you're saying.
Yeah.

2109
02:00:58.570 --> 02:01:00.450
Like they know the camera's on them.
Yeah.

2110
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:05.050
And that's why they're acting in sort of an unnatural way or in a manipulative

2111
02:01:05.051 --> 02:01:09.580
way.
Right,
right.
And that manipulation applies to social media as well.

2112
02:01:09.581 --> 02:01:10.410
It's just a,

2113
02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:15.410
it's a less pervasive method of doing it and broadcast it to a million plus

2114
02:01:15.791 --> 02:01:17.230
people on a reality show.

2115
02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:21.700
You're broadcasting to 10,000 people who follow you on Twitter.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2116
02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:24.820
That's a big part of what people are doing it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like what is,

2117
02:01:24.821 --> 02:01:29.380
what's real?
It's also what Hashtag activism is.
What is Hashtag activism?

2118
02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.990
I think it's a lot of what it is.
Yeah.
No,
I think it can be.

2119
02:01:31.991 --> 02:01:35.530
I think it can be both.
I mean,
I,
I agree with you and I disagree because I think,

2120
02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:39.860
I think sometimes people are genuine,
but then some people are just,
you know,

2121
02:01:39.970 --> 02:01:43.340
two in the morning.
Yeah.
I mean there's no black or white in this.
Yeah,
yeah.

2122
02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:48.220
Or I should say,
yeah,
great.
I say great.

2123
02:01:48.221 --> 02:01:49.680
Is that okay?
I remember doing it

2124
02:01:49.810 --> 02:01:54.810
<v 1>stand up set on a show years ago in la called late Friday and I got,</v>

2125
02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:58.390
I remember doing my first joke,

2126
02:01:58.510 --> 02:02:02.260
it's a setup and a punchline and I say the set up part,

2127
02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:07.090
then I have a slight pause.
Everyone starts laughing and I was like,

2128
02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.870
what the fuck's going on?
That's the way.
They've never laughed there.

2129
02:02:10.871 --> 02:02:13.720
Ever have been in this job for two years.
They've never laughed at that point.

2130
02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:16.650
And then I get to the punchline and they're still having the setup.

2131
02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.280
They don't really left the punchline that much.

2132
02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:22.120
And then after about like three and the first of the first few minutes,

2133
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:24.850
we're all just weird like that.
And then after about three,
four minutes,

2134
02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:26.500
it kind of became like a normal set.

2135
02:02:26.690 --> 02:02:31.240
And then afterwards I found out that the entire audience was a paid background,

2136
02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.153
extra act.

2137
02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:36.450
<v 2>So,
and they didn't tell me that before going on.
So that's kind of like,
you know,</v>

2138
02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:39.360
reminds you what you were saying about,
you know,
everyone had on their own show.

2139
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:41.400
So they were trying to be,

2140
02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:44.490
they were acting and trying to act like an audience member instead of just

2141
02:02:44.491 --> 02:02:47.070
sitting there and just,
just let it happen.
You don't have to do anything.

2142
02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:52.530
I need background and everybody,
when Judah comes out,
he's going to say jokes,

2143
02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:55.590
don't want you to laugh it up on here.
Your best laugh right now.
Come on folks.

2144
02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:59.750
You can do better.
Is that all you got?
And that's the way.

2145
02:02:59.790 --> 02:03:03.760
So a lot of times comedy on TV is where it's just,
it's so fake,
you know?

2146
02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:09.540
<v 1>Well that's a more extreme example,
but it is like,
it's just the,
I don't know,</v>

2147
02:03:09.541 --> 02:03:14.220
but it's not easy to capture.
You know,
even when you see specials,

2148
02:03:14.221 --> 02:03:17.500
it's not easy to capture a real standup night cause

2149
02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.580
<v 2>those cameras in there and people know what's going on.</v>

2150
02:03:20.581 --> 02:03:23.970
It always adds a little bit of a different dynamic,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2151
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.690
You know,
Hunter Thompson was talking about that a long time ago.

2152
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:30.600
Documentary about,
yeah,
it was a,
he,
he started filming things,

2153
02:03:30.690 --> 02:03:34.200
started carrying things like carrying cameras around and filming things.

2154
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:37.620
And he was talking about,
um,
they were interviewing him for this,

2155
02:03:37.621 --> 02:03:40.800
a BBC documentary that they were doing.
I think it was BBC,

2156
02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.420
and he was saying that having a camera changes everything because you're not

2157
02:03:45.421 --> 02:03:48.240
capturing reality because the having the camera and knowing that it's being

2158
02:03:48.241 --> 02:03:50.610
filmed changes exactly what it is.

2159
02:03:50.611 --> 02:03:53.370
You become something different now because everyone's aware of the camera.

2160
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:57.730
And this is a documentary he made that he was now was about him.
Yeah,

2161
02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:59.970
it sounds great.
There's a few,
he's got a couple of,

2162
02:03:59.971 --> 02:04:04.740
I'm a big fan of a hundred times,
but,
uh,
uh,
the one Gonzo,

2163
02:04:04.741 --> 02:04:07.280
the life and times of hunters Thompson does.

2164
02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:09.330
I think that was what it was all better.
Yeah,
that was one.

2165
02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:14.740
And then there was another one feel fear and loathing and La in Hollywood,

2166
02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.330
I think,
I forgot which one it was,
but there's like,
there's a few of them,

2167
02:04:18.331 --> 02:04:21.390
you can find them online.
I'll check those out.
And that sounds really cool.

2168
02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.250
But they were at his place and Woody Creek,

2169
02:04:23.251 --> 02:04:25.830
Colorado with cameras and filming him and he's like,
well,

2170
02:04:25.831 --> 02:04:29.040
this isn't reality because you've got a camera.
As soon as you use that camera.

2171
02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:33.030
He was incredibly perceptive a person,
man.

2172
02:04:33.090 --> 02:04:35.650
That's pretty cool when it came to himself.
Interesting.
Yeah.

2173
02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:38.040
It's all sets of blind that people had in

2174
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.340
<v 1>their own life.
Yeah.
That's,
I mean,
I think that's,
uh,</v>

2175
02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.810
that's probably pretty common,
you know?
Fuck yeah.
It's way more common than not.

2176
02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.350
Yeah.
And I think it's,
I think it's good to admit that,
you know?
Yeah.

2177
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.960
I think that's one problem is we were like,
a lot of people don't admit that.

2178
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:55.400
It's like,
it's okay to have flaws.
You know,

2179
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:58.860
we all have flaws and that's all.
If you don't have flaws,
you're not human.

2180
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:00.820
And that's the thing about social media.
That's a weird,

2181
02:05:01.090 --> 02:05:05.240
it often shows people are showing themselves without the flaws.
So it's,

2182
02:05:05.241 --> 02:05:06.061
it's like you said,

2183
02:05:06.061 --> 02:05:11.061
it's like everything's kind of fake on a certain level and they also find a flaw

2184
02:05:11.371 --> 02:05:15.240
that you have and just fucking,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2185
02:05:15.630 --> 02:05:19.380
I taught target.
Yeah.
What did you say about black pay by Jude at?
Yeah,

2186
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:24.360
so I didn't,
black lung,
a lung.
It's a dark,
it's,
it's cigarettes.

2187
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:30.240
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a kind of thing that was kind of thing I used to worry about.

2188
02:05:30.250 --> 02:05:33.150
Like,
Oh,
you do one thing and flock,
they're going to get you out.

2189
02:05:33.151 --> 02:05:36.750
And I had a couple of drawings in here where it's paralysis by the way I draw
it.

2190
02:05:36.751 --> 02:05:39.600
And the way I worded,
I'm like,
am I going to get shit on for this?

2191
02:05:39.601 --> 02:05:42.870
And I was like a couple of them.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Listen,

2192
02:05:42.871 --> 02:05:45.300
I gotta get Outta here,
but let's,
uh,
let's highlight the book.

2193
02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:49.930
Good to have them here.
Yeah.
Not to beat up anybody to have one.
Yeah.

2194
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:54.030
That one you can get on Amazon for 35 cents and shipping is three nine nine.

2195
02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:58.490
The new one if rain 39 cents,
you can get your,
yeah,
I think,
you know,

2196
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.650
cause you can get used copies I think.
No,
it's like 14 bucks.

2197
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:04.170
But if you want to use to copy,
I think it's like 35,

2198
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:07.980
six three 99.
Yeah.
And if that,

2199
02:06:08.150 --> 02:06:09.660
you may not be a good salesman.

2200
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:12.330
I tell people to buy the shitty shit or an artist.
But yeah,

2201
02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:16.050
if the raindrops United,
this has been my big passion,
the past.
Uh,

2202

if you like be clea band or maybe even some of the old Gary Larson stuff,

2203
02:06:19.741 --> 02:06:22.050
