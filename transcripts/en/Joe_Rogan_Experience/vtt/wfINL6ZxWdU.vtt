<v Speaker 1>You can ask anybody who goes to like China driving over there is crazy.</v>

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.100
<v Speaker 1>They have lights but they don't follow them.</v>

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>They're like Christmas ornaments,</v>

5
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.224
<v Speaker 1>traffic lights.</v>

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>They're just over there blinking and no one's following them.</v>

7
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>When you see the two red lines,</v>

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.170

<v Speaker 1>You want to make a left hand turn in China,</v>

11
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't make it from the left hand side.</v>

12
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>You come all the way from the right and you turn over there.</v>

13
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Why don't,</v>

14
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

15
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>It's two weirdest thing I've ever seen them.</v>

18
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>because that's how they do it over there.</v>

19
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.701
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

20
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.031
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

21
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

22
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't ever turn left from the left lane from the right and you're over</v>

23
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:39.501
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

24
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>You turn way over there.</v>

25
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Can we find evidence of this online?</v>

26
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Google that I have.</v>

27
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Everything I say I know will be instantly googled.</v>

28
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but yeah man,</v>

30
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

31
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Me and Steve Byrne,</v>

32
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>we screamed like little girls at least 13,</v>

33
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>two times on the ride home.</v>

34
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>It is scary.</v>

35
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

36
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Didn't see one traffic accident,</v>

37
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>not one over there.</v>

38
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>And the bulk of the country drives on the right.</v>

39
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:05.504
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

41
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some confusion here.</v>

42
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the confusion is.</v>

44
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:10.724
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

45
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

46
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.503
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>some of the country in China drives on the right,</v>

48
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>but some drives in the left.</v>

49
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's where the,</v>

50
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:17.931
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>the issue is.</v>

53
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense to people?</v>

54
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Drive on the right side and half the people don't want he telling you,</v>

55
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:25.124
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

56

58
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they just go right in to the lane.</v>

59
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>What are we watching?</v>

60
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Accidents.</v>

61
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 1>This is Chinese trafficked.</v>

62
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say Chinese traffic cause you know someone's going to get run</v>

64
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This guy cannot do this.</v>

105
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:50.570
<v Speaker 1>He must back up and rethink and get a helicopter.</v>

106

<v Speaker 1>That's the only way he's getting across that lane.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

127
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>these people on Bikes are insane.</v>

128
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to cross the traffic.</v>

129
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.351
<v Speaker 1>They just say,</v>

130
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:23.711
<v Speaker 1>ready,</v>

131

<v Speaker 1>You know what they saying?</v>

135
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it has to do with the Chinese culture and the way they interact with</v>

136
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

137
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>They mind their own business.</v>

138
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't look to the left into the right.</v>

139
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>They just keep,</v>

140
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.973
<v Speaker 1>keep straight.</v>

141
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>

142
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

143
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.681
<v Speaker 1>they're socially,</v>

144
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.180
<v Speaker 1>this is explained to me by a Chinese man that the,</v>

145
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:44.451
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

146
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:44.661
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

147
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the way they're socially,</v>

148
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

149
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>sort of a groom to interact with people and walking.</v>

150
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.890
