<v Speaker 1>This gives me anxiety.</v>

14
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>You know what's cool about surfing is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those moments,</v>

15
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>like there's very few things in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world other than like,</v>

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno how to relate that,</v>

17
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like that moment right there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

18
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>it was like the pinnacle of like who I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am,</v>

19
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>what I do best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That moment,</v>

20
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>that wave coming in at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that minute in my life where I was in</v>

21
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>a right square foot of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that wave came in,</v>

22
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>that was the best.</v>

23
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the best days in history</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that surf spot.</v>

24
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>and I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was prepared,</v>

26
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I was healthy at the right board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right equipment,</v>

27
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>the right energy level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't sick.</v>

28
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>everything was just lined up and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves are lined up and the swell was</v>

30
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>lined up and the wind was lining up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tide is lined up and I was in the</v>

31
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>perfect spot when that wave came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch the video all the time?</v>

32
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every time I do I remember all those</v>

33
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>things because it seems so much so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much luck had to do with it.</v>

34
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a line in the stars</v>
<v Speaker 1>aligning and it almost seems like</v>

35
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>something I'd want to watch every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like brick get,</v>

36
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>get the day going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know your first kiss from a girl.</v>

37
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

38
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>That like mind blown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

39
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like an important moment in my</v>

40
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to like have this moment in time</v>

41
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is right there.</v>

42
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And so I think as an adult you very</v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely have those moments left.</v>

43
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like a really like mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding and exploding moments.</v>

44
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

45
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>this is life hundred percent life right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

46
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think we're all chasing.</v>

47
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people sitting in traffic outside</v>

48
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>right now driving the freeway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not having those moments.</v>

49
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Not right then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>

50
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem with life is that</v>

51
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>people aren't having enough of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments and when you're a 75 yards away</v>

52
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>from that elc a few weeks ago and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an hour to,</v>

53
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>to really think about what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where you,</v>

54
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>where in your life and you know how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to 75 yards away from this animal,</v>

55
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>the whole year of practicing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>target and all the millions of arrows</v>

56
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>you shot and all the preparation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

57
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>and then this thing stands up and time's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticking and that moment is there for the</v>

58
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>taking and it's so easy to fuck up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

59
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>it all happens the way that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hope to visualize it though.</v>

60
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Those moments don't happen very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We were like working for the government</v>

128
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and we're trying to decipher like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tape.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like we have to find out where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidnappers being held home and now you</v>

131
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be audio experts in a room</v>

132
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got it.</v>

133
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>We've got whole man out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It could be or it could be.</v>

136
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm home here now because he gives out</v>

137
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 2>his address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

138
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more time at 2195 and we cut it off.</v>

139
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 2>We cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat me on me.</v>

140
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These can be anything I'm home,</v>

141
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 2>homey on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you felt calm while it was flipping?</v>

142
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

143
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen cars flip,</v>

144
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it for years,</v>

145
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I know it's possible.</v>

146
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So I get in there and I got turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at a race in 1998.</v>

147
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I was racing at Daytona and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I got turned around and the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm flipping for the first time in my</v>

149
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>life and this car is like over 3000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 pounds.</v>

150
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:30.334
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

151
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but it flies up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's paper,</v>

152
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:34.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing in the world.</v>

153
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so you're weightless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.040
<v Speaker 1>and what it felt like to me cause so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car rolled on its side and uh,</v>

155
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480
<v Speaker 1>came down kind of on its side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like somebody rolled a prop wall</v>

156
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>of grass up against the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

157
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>When I was on my side and I could see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>

158
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was right side up.</v>

159
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Because as you're flipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force pushes you down in the seat so</v>

160
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>you feel it turned ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel gravity all the time.</v>

161
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>as a cars flipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

163
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you're pushed into the seat so you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

164
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you feel weight of yourself in the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never changes.</v>

165
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:12.400
<v Speaker 1>You never kind of come up out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene like that,</v>

166
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like somebody wrote a prop</v>

167
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grass up against the side of the car</v>

168
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>and then against the roof and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>against that side,</v>

169
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and then this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.650
<v Speaker 1>it kept doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

171
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just the weirdest feeling and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel completely safe.</v>

172
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like,</v>

173
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going to harm me,</v>

174
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

175
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

176
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

177
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we always talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

178
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.770
<v Speaker 1>get your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.150
<v Speaker 1>owned to something because the spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your arms just go like this.</v>

180
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you watch a lot of old wrecks</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sixties and seventies,</v>

181
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the guy's arms come flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the window and they're just kind of</v>

182
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:47.100
<v Speaker 1>flopping around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't pull it.</v>

183
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spinning so fast,</v>

184
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't pull it in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>your arms would go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you know you're going</v>

186
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>upside down and he grabbed the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steering wheel and Kinda,</v>

187
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

188
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll flip my pickup truck one time on</v>

189
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Christmas Day and I wasn't holding on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steering wheel and my arm went out</v>

190
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.690
<v Speaker 1>for like a split second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It banged around in the,</v>

192
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the window seal and I was like,</v>

193
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.801
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I got it back in and grabbed a hold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steering wheel with both my hands.</v>

195
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And so ever since then I've like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>now I know like anytime I'm in a crash</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have your hands a hold of</v>

197
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

198
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the one thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't control your,</v>

199
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you're strapped in with your seatbelt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything but your arms are and you</v>

200
00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can go anywhere.</v>

201
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And in that moment when the car's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling or barrel rolling or flipping</v>

202
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fast.</v>

203
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your arms just go this way.</v>

204
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>The craziest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only fear I guess is that</v>

205
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>your arm could get outside the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get crushed or something.</v>

206
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause you guys have had that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the discourse in this country has</v>

207
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 1>completely collapsed and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you love it though?</v>

208
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>This course is cloud because my rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>are enough for discussion,</v>

209
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>let alone a vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever people sit down and have a</v>

210
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>talk about my life and freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to end badly for me.</v>

211
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So if people can't talk to each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

212
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll go our separate ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live peacefully.</v>

213
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>So you'd rather not talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go peacefully.</v>

214
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's political opinions and</v>

215
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>preferences should have as much impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life as their sexual preferences.</v>

216
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>You want to fuck dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a threesome?</v>

217
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care if you're my friend and that I'm</v>

218
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to impact me and it</v>

219
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't impact me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing with,</v>

220
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>oh you want more welfare?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

221
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Go live your life that way instead of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming some shouting match on your</v>

222
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 1>front door and exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Instead of you and your buddies coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and scare the shit out of my kids.</v>

224
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

225
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean very few people deserve that.</v>

226
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few people deserve that.</v>

227
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the disengaging from political</v>

228
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>discourse as a strategy for just overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>civility,</v>

229
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but also worsening political discourse</v>
<v Speaker 1>on purpose to make it so that people</v>

230
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>can't actually form coalitions and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything done.</v>

231
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 1>But it is amazing how personal people</v>
<v Speaker 1>take other people's opinions on things.</v>

232
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the people jet it,</v>

233
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is like when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dating and you think,</v>

234
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

235
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 1>this girl likes the same kind of music I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

236
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a very weak correlation.</v>

237
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of people who are right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing who are good people and there's</v>

238
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>lots of people who are left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are good people and there's lots of</v>

239
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>people who are right wing who are bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

240
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a very weak correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

241
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cultural signifier.</v>

242
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 1>You probably came from the same culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people just take the culture of</v>

243
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>what they grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to just dismiss it,</v>

244
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's higher schools of thought just</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they vote differently from you is</v>

245
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>as a personal level that's you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing out a lot of quality people.</v>

246
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps Erickson did before him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

247
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

248
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take an automatic process and you</v>

249
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>interrupted in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when you're shaking hands with</v>

250
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's such a familiar process</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you start,</v>

251
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:49.141
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

252
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to grip this person's hand now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm gonna move my hand up and down</v>

253
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:53.420
<v Speaker 1>with them a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll take my hand away.</v>

254
00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just kind</v>

255
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 4>of do it automatically and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something about interrupting that that</v>

256
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 4>leaves people</v>
<v Speaker 4>really flummoxed and the world it,</v>

257
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 4>cause they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really caught off guard.</v>

258
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Like if you imagine somebody comes up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you in the street and says it's not half</v>

259
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.490
<v Speaker 4>past seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

260
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.540
<v Speaker 4>your reaction isn't to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

261
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's 20 past nine.</v>

262
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Your reaction is to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a sort of,</v>

263
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 4>you think like you've missed something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're trying to make sense of it.</v>

264
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>

265
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:24.300
<v Speaker 4>puts you on the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at that point if you to,</v>

266
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 4>if you've got somebody who's fairly</v>
<v Speaker 4>suggestible and people coming up on</v>

267
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 4>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such an odd moment for them anyway.</v>

268
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:34.291
<v Speaker 4>They're naturally very suggestible that</v>
<v Speaker 4>a clear instruction to sleep or whatever</v>

269
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 4>you want to give them tends to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 4>very deeply and very often than you'll</v>

270
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>

271
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 4>I'll shake hands and I'll break the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern to the handshakes.</v>

272
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll often take their hand and lifted up</v>

273
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 4>to their face and say sleep and show</v>
<v Speaker 4>them their hand like that and they just</v>

274
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 4>sleep and well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not sleep that it's a kind of,</v>

275
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like,</v>

276
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

277
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.650
<v Speaker 4>they'll do anything from eyes closed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>head drops down to just drop like a,</v>

278
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 4>like a dead weight on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

279
00:12:58.421 --> 00:12:59.650
<v Speaker 4>what I found is most interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

280
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:00.484
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

281
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 4>like applying this in slightly more</v>
<v Speaker 4>useful everyday situations was as a sort</v>

282
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 4>of like a self defense technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was walking,</v>

283
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between,</v>

284
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>must have been like 20 or something.</v>

285
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 4>And I was at a magic convention and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was walking from one hotel to another</v>

286
00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 4>and I'm dressing like a three piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>velvet suit as this skinny British law.</v>

287
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I might as well have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

288
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 4>punched me in the throat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tattooed across my face.</v>

289
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.430
<v Speaker 4>And this guy comes up and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

290
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 4>he's drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's about three in the morning,</v>

291
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 4>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive is with his girlfriend,</v>

292
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.720
<v Speaker 4>clearly looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

293
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 4>he sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he comes up to me and he says,</v>

294
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:39.731
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

295
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 4>what do you fucking looking at when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at?</v>

296
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 4>And because I had spoken about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to deal with this sort of thing,</v>

297
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:47.680
<v Speaker 4>but it never found myself in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

298
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 4>I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I said to him,</v>

299
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wall outside,</v>

300
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:57.121
<v Speaker 4>my house isn't four foot high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I guess there's an equivalent of</v>

301
00:13:57.661 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 4>this with a sort of adrenaline dump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called,</v>

302
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:00.580
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in martial arts.</v>

303
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:01.130
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

304
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just like he's got all this</v>

305
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline and then a thing like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

306
00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 4>which is just out of context.</v>

307
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Like it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like talking gibberish.</v>

308
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just out of context.</v>

309
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now suddenly his thinking that I've</v>

310
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've missed something.</v>

311
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 4>So now he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was hitting,</v>

312
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 4>you went what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said his girlfriend walked off and</v>

313
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

314
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 4>the wall outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my house isn't full for high.</v>

315
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 4>I spent some time in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the walls that were very high,</v>

316
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the ones here that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're tiny,</v>

317
00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:29.390
<v Speaker 4>then nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he just sort of broke down.</v>

318
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.510
<v Speaker 4>He sort of went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

319
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.830
<v Speaker 4>ha and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start crying.</v>

320
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.641
<v Speaker 4>What you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

321
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't quite crying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just,</v>

322
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.600
<v Speaker 4>it was like all the adrenaline and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything just,</v>

323
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 4>just flooded out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he sat down and I ended up sitting</v>

324
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 4>next to him on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

325
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

326
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 4>on the road side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm asking him,</v>

327
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what I was,</v>

328
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 4>the plan was I was going to try and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stick his feet to the floor and I had</v>

329
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 4>his whole plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just kind of collapsed and sat down.</v>

330
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the,</v>

331
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 4>cause I knew it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is highly suggestible state and</v>

332
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 4>like either way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment of aggression in past,</v>

333
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 4>but I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ended up weirdly sitting with them,</v>

334
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 4>asking him what had happened that</v>
<v Speaker 4>evening and his girlfriend did.</v>

335
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 4>I think she'd bottled somebody or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something horrible had happened.</v>

336
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 4>She said we'd got out with all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggression,</v>

337
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.940
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good one,</v>

338
00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just have like,</v>

339
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be just a song lyric or just</v>

340
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some weird kind of thing that you can</v>

341
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 4>just go into it in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

342
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 4>if someone's running at you with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>knife,</v>

343
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just,</v>

344
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of strangely taking control</v>

345
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.603
<v Speaker 4>of a situation.</v>

346
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
