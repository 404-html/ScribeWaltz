The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.750
<v 0>Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.813
<v 2>Right?</v>

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.630
I can't tell ya how many times on this podcast we've talked about growing your

5
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.170
own food,

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.200
about how great it would be if people figured out a way to utilize like empty

7
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.741
spaces in neighborhoods or a lot on a block and put in a garden and then boom,

8
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.740
somebody sent me a link to your Ted talk and I said,
Ron Finley is on it.

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.930
You're on it.
And you've been doing this for a while.
Tell me,

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.440
tell me how you got started in this.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.950
<v 1>It was real simple.
Ain't no damn food where I live,
you know?
So my thing was,</v>

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.250
if it ain't there,
you put it there.
It's,
I mean,
I,
and I,

13
00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:59.100
I think these neighborhoods are by design.

14
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.480
I think this whole food system is to me,
a form of slavery for everybody.

15
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.550
You know?
And I think a lot of people don't get it.

16
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
They want to control your life.
And if you control the food,

17
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.410
you can draw with a word.

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
<v 2>Do you think it's by design where someone's set out and said,
okay,</v>

19
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.660
we want to take these people and we want to keep them impoverished.

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.290
We're going to keep them ignorant and want to keep them in this,

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
this cycle of crime and poverty with no escape?

22
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
Or do you think it's convenient for them to ignore it because they don't get any

23
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.570
benefit on trying to make it better?

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.190
<v 1>They do get a benefit is so much money being raped from these communities there.</v>

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.040
It's not that they're poor.
I mean,
to me it's all by design.

26
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.970
It's too perfect of a storm.
Not to be by design.

27
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.650
The fact that you have what,
four corners,
but you have six fast food restaurants.

28
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.240
These restaurants are not making no money.
Bullshit.
You know,
it's,
it's,

29
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:59.290
it's like in the school system.
Come on.
I'm sure you've been in the schools,
Joe.

30
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.380
Yeah.
Till you can't tell me that's not by design.

31
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.860
You can't tell me the food they're eating in these schools from day one.

32
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.410
Isn't that,
you know,
it's garbage,
you know,

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.670
<v 2>is definitely garbage.</v>

34
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.600
But I always felt like it was more of an opportunistic thing than a by design

35
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.010
thing.
Like it's very,
um,

36
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.710
it's very fun to sit around and think about like the cabal of Illuminati that

37
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:25.450
controls the world and like to break that down into and to get all the way down

38
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.070
to urban neighborhoods and to think about it.

39
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:31.540
Like it's by design that these neighborhoods are the way they are.
Um,

40
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.580
but I always wonder how much of it is actually just people taking advantage of

41
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:39.850
people who are in a situation when there's no other options where they don't

42
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:42.040
have anything better until a guy like you comes along.

43
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.130
<v 1>Oh,
I'm,
I'm one person,
but yeah,</v>

44
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.870
<v 2>but you're one person with a message and that's all it takes some time.</v>

45
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.950
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's crazy that I'm,
that I'm even here.
I mean,
how I'm here,
it's,</v>

46
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.780
I didn't plan that it is,
you know,
and all of a sudden,
you know,

47
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:01.690
I plant a seed in the ground and shit in Greece.
I mean,
I mean,

48
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.280
cut a,
I'm an old man.
I'm,
I'm in England,
you know,
from,
from planting the seed.

49
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.890
In the ground and south central so it's everywhere.
Right

50
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.560
<v 3>Joe,
you know what I'm saying?
That's how it works.</v>

51
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.650
Sometimes it just takes someone to do something and everybody goes,
oh yeah,

52
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.030
exactly.
That's what's happening.
When I was a kid,

53
00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:23.930
my stepdad was a part of this community garden thing.
Like it was,

54
00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:26.750
he was going to college and there was this,
um,

55
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.500
this thing that they would do with a class where they would have,

56
00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.500
everybody would have shifts,
you know,
they would have to take care of the garden.

57
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.200
And I remember thinking like,
what a great idea.
Like this is a,

58
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.310
it was amazing idea.

59
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:41.270
Like why shouldn't everybody grow their own food if you just,
we have one lot,

60
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.040
one lot.
If there's a hundred houses on a block,
one lot is just gardens.

61
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.430
You got everybody's food right there.
Because if you do that,

62
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.020
you're destroying the system.
Come on.
I mean,
that's what it is.
They just can't,

63
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:57.950
why is it illegal to plant food?
That's where it gets weird.

64
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.210
Weird,
right?
Joe,
tell me how illegal it is,

65
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:06.780
but I'm saying weird in that like how,
how are the laws written?
Like what,

66
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.880
what is illegal?

67
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.920
<v 1>Well,
I'm now the laws in La have been changed,
you know,</v>

68
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.660
say thank you guys too,
you know,
because of these nails in my hands,
you know,

69
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:21.120
from,
from me being put up on that on the wall.
But um,

70
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.390
a lot of places it's still against the law.

71
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.680
And why would it be against the law to grow food,
you know?
Um,

72
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.130
that's what I'm saying about this,
this whole slavery thing,
man.

73
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.910
<v 3>Well it's,
it's a suburban thing too.
There was some folks,</v>

74
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:38.340
was it Detroit or where was it?
Where they got arrested for uh,

75
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.050
for having chickens?
Yeah,
so I think it was Illinois.
I don't remember him,

76
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.120
but these people just had a normal like backyard chicken coop.
Where's it?

77
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.610
Michigan,
Michigan.
And they got arrested.

78
00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:52.310
They went to fucking jail for having chickens.

79
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.380
<v 1>When I first did,
when I first put my garden on my parkway,
I mean,</v>

80
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.720
I literally got a warrant.

81
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.480
This is the time you saw is not the first time.

82
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.380
That's the second time because I guess I'm kinda thick,
like the Italians say,

83
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.730
you know,
uh,
he don't get it.
Uh,
but yeah,
no,
I got it.

84
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.560
I had to go to court,
you know,
twice to make sure,
hey,
get it out,
you know,

85
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:19.090
take this out.
You can only have this and this.
If some guy says you can,
well,

86
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.700
you can keep the trees.
I kept the trees and somebody came back,

87
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.260
you're getting cited for the trees.
Take,
I said,
take everything out.
Why Dude?

88
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.260
There's,
there's,
there's nothing to eat around here and you,
and you're going to,

89
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.520
I'm going to get penalized.

90
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.230
I have a strip of land is that usually people leave their dressers and trash and

91
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:39.550
condoms and toilets and sinks and shit on the,
on the,

92
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.290
on the parkway and all of a sudden I beautify it and it's like,
oh no,

93
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.230
this is against the law to have beauty out here,
dude.
You can't do that.

94
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.350
<v 3>So did they find you when you were planting these things or did someone,</v>

95
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.650
<v 1>somebody called a neighbor called and um,
motherfuckers</v>

96
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.990
<v 3>grown blew it and that's it.
But that's,</v>

97
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>it's cool because I tell people to embrace your haters because they make you</v>

98
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.340
famous.
You know?
Cause the next thing I know,

99
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.341
I'm on a 27 floor suite overlooking the harbor in Vancouver about to do the

100
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.480
first ted I got did the got,
that took me to the big Ted,
you know,
so,

101
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.890
so it was,
it was,
it was kind of weird.

102
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.690
I never forget this moment man.

103
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:24.980
I was looking in the window looking out at the Harvard and you know,

104
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.670
so I saw my reflection in the window and I'm like,
Damn Dude,

105
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.520
you standing here because of some hater.
You know,

106
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.500
you're in another country and some damn sweet because of somebody tried to get

107
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:39.200
you in trouble,
you know,
planting carrots.

108
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 3>Well that's sort of the,</v>

109
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.320
someone getting mad at you sorta put energy into it.

110
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.300
It made it more,
more vital.
Made the whole thing there was more behind it,
right?

111
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.840
<v 1>Yeah,
totally.
Because,</v>

112
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.040
because I think a lot of people woke up and saw this is the shit is stupid.

113
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.240
You know,
what,
why,
why are you disguise beautifying his neighborhood,
you know,

114
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:04.240
it's not costing you anything.
And,
and,
um,
and,
and,

115
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.090
and this is against the law.
So fortunately,
um,
Steve Lopez,
you know,

116
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.630
from the La Times who is a beast to me,
you know,
Steve,

117
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.420
don't put Steve on nothing cause he's gonna tell your Mama's maiden name,

118
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.940
the prostitute you were with,
you know,
the dog you left on the fridge of Steve,

119
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:25.050
don't play the radio,
he don't play,
you know.
So,
um,

120
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.310
he got ahold of it and I'm my councilman,
Herb Wesson,
you know,

121
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.050
I love him dearly now.
And um,
he saw it,
he said,
damn,

122
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.320
I guess you right.
And he credits me too,

123
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.260
has bringing this really to his attention.
Where before,

124
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.160
before it was like the guys breaking the law just deal with him like that,

125
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.670
you know.
So now it's,
it's,
it's the law and that's beautiful.

126
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.680
And he gave me a plaques,
Herb Weston,
you know,
actually gave me this food hero,

127
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.440
black full of food day,
um,
you know,
a couple of months ago.

128
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.840
<v 3>That's amazing.
So essentially those two guys.</v>

129
00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:02.410
So Steve Lopez and who's the other gentleman?
Uh,
counseling and Herb Wesson,

130
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.430
Herb Weston.
So those two guys essentially were the,
the,

131
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.150
the force behind they saw what you were doing and they were the force behind

132
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.660
getting it didn't start out like that,
you know,
it didn't,
no.
Hell No.

133
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:15.310
They threw me under the bus before.

134
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.810
<v 1>Not,
uh,
not,
not,
uh,
Steve Lopez.
Not Steve,</v>

135
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.380
not Steve,
but you know,
the city through,

136
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.180
let's just say the city threw me under the bus because they had,

137
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:32.280
they looked and realized that,
oh,
he did this before,
you know,
so I said,

138
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.380
no,
repeat offending exactly.

139
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.980
<v 3>Is it again,</v>

140
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.670
<v 1>I wonder why he wasn't no damn humming birds and butterflies get his ass out of</v>

141
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.270
here.
Flowers.

142
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.860
They wasn't having it.
So yeah,
so that,
but now they see,

143
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.270
and it's beautiful because now herb has actually,
uh,

144
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.850
he built a named in the area named after his wife.
So they sit in the,

145
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.520
and it was on a lot that's been vacant for years.
So it's,
so they're seeing it,

146
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.570
I don't know.
And they're supposed to address the fact that,

147
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.770
that I brought up that 26 square miles of vacant lots in the,

148
00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:11.850
in La that and they said,
wow,
you're right.
You know,

149
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:15.570
we need to give up some of this space for people to grow gardens.

150
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.470
And it's just like you said,
what about if one lot on this block?

151
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.710
What about if every block had,
and that's where I,
that's where I'm at.
Joe.

152
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.220
Just imagine if you planted your parkways,
but just again,

153
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.450
it's like you creating a neighborhood,
you creating system,

154
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:34.620
you creating safety and you're creating health all in the same al at the same

155
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.450
time.
It's dangerous,
dude.
It's good,
but it's dangerous.
What's the danger for,

156
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.910
uh,
for the people that don't live on your block,

157
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.630
the people that setting the prices at the supermarkets,
you know,
cause your,

158
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.180
your visit to the supermarkets are now going to be less frequent.
Right?

159
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.060
But how much influence to the people that own the supermarket is actually have,

160
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.610
do you think they have a lot?
They have a lot of influence.
I mean,

161
00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.100
you gotta think,
look,
it's not called big ag for,

162
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.250
for just for a reason.
You know,
we need,
we have to buy a shit.
You know,

163
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.800
they need somebody divided and guess what?
You know,

164
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:09.300
it's just like the dialysis centers.

165
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.510
I didn't see any dialysis centers driving in over here,

166
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.130
but you go to every hood you go to in the United States that I've been to,

167
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.380
there's a dialysis center there because people have diabetes cause and why and

168
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.330
why couldn't can't these dialysis center come in and say,
hey man,

169
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.600
if you change your diet for a week,
you might not need us.
Hell No.

170
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.010
We've created a whole nother medical industry that did not exist.

171
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.040
<v 2>You fly over La and you look down at all those people that need food.</v>

172
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.100
It's amazing how poorly it's planned out.
Yep.

173
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.600
When you think about all the lawns that are on these fucking golf courses that

174
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.640
use millions of gallons of water,
I mean,

175
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:50.250
I don't know if you've ever seen the statistics on when we are,

176
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.370
we're going through an insane drought right now for folks who don't know.

177
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.230
There was a recent story that said that we need 11 trillion gallons of water to

178
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:01.140
bring it up.
Just tobacco to where it's supposed to be.

179
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.180
Just to bring us back to baseline,
this is a place that I go to a,

180
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.850
it's to hone ranch is about,
uh,
an hour and a half north of here.

181
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.450
And they had this lake that was like one of the best bass fishing lakes in

182
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:17.451
southern California and all the bast died because the water level got so low.

183
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.710
There was no oxygen in the water,
the,
the,
the,

184
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.070
all the vegetation died and all the fish to start floating to service.

185
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.940
And the guy who works there was telling me like trophy bass,
like big,
you know,

186
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.760
seven,
10 pound bass just floating to the surface.
Wow.

187
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.670
<v 1>And what,
what I see is this was,</v>

188
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.130
this is not new Joe.
They knew this,

189
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.210
they knew that what kind of climate we have and all of a sudden we're at

190
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:44.680
critical mass and now all of a sudden if there,
oh,
uh,
yeah,

191
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.640
let's do something about the water.
No,
dude,

192
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:48.740
you should have did something about the water.
30 years ago.

193
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:53.180
You knew it was a problem.
You know where we live.
So why doesn't everybody,

194
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.000
aren't we collecting water off the roof of every damn house in this,
in,

195
00:11:57.001 --> 00:11:59.860
in this city,
man,
it's,
they could address this,

196
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.420
all these millions and millions and trillions of gallons of water when it rains

197
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.490
or,
or just goals through the,

198
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.300
through the sewer system and none when you can collect that water.
It's true.

199
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.840
And my point was the amount

200
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.030
<v 2>water that it takes to water this fucking golf courses is obscene.
Yeah.</v>

201
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.850
I mean it's incredible,
but it's gotta be Green.
Come on dude.

202
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.630
Shit gotta be Green Joe.
Why are you playing?
Isn't that amazing though?

203
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.090
What do you think about the amount of money?
I mean,

204
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.900
obviously their money and it costs a lot of money to join country clubs and
shit,

205
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:34.470
but water is kind of a shared resource.
It's everybody's,

206
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.450
and if you looked out at la,

207
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:40.160
that giant mass of La and how few gardens or are,

208
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.150
how few areas are growing food,
it's,
it's really kind of crazy

209
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.050
<v 1>when you look at what we pay for a bottle of water.
That's crazy.</v>

210
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.140
When you use crazy,
we literally pay more for water.

211
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.500
Then we pay for gas and nobody bottled water and nobody's,

212
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:01.010
nobody's addressing the air of the girls.
Price is $3 Oh my God.
You know,

213
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:04.590
it was like,
dude,
you paying like $4 a gallon for water.

214
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.130
Do you don't realize that.

215
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.760
<v 2>I was in Alaska and we were staying at this place on the Prince of Wales Island</v>

216
00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:15.320
and it's a way up high and it rains every day there and you could literally take

217
00:13:15.321 --> 00:13:19.670
your glass and Dicky dip it into the water and drink.
It gets pure.

218
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.870
It's pure rain water.
And it's so funny because it felt so,
I'm like,

219
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:26.690
are you sure?
And they were drinking.
I'm like,

220
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:28.910
can you show you could just drink this water?
And then I thought about it,

221
00:13:28.911 --> 00:13:33.650
I'm like,
how crazy is it that we're like,
we're scared to drink most water.

222
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.690
Like we're scared to drink fucking tap water.

223
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:37.210
A lot of people worried about tap water.

224
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.750
They have these Brita filters and charcoal filters and filtration systems in

225
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:45.320
their houses and shit.
But you know,
in the last guy,

226
00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:46.580
you just dip your glass in there.
Yep.

227
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.360
<v 1>Oh,
that's supposed to be because the water has been treated,</v>

228
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.660
you know,
it has all kinds of shit and it has a fluoride,

229
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:58.800
it has all kinds of added stuff in the water to make it not harm us.

230
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:02.700
But everything,
I've read them fluoride,
it's not sexy.
Yeah.

231
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:06.030
Fluoride is not good for you.
Yeah,
it's not,
but it's in your water.
So

232
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.440
<v 2>never did a series of studies on fluoride and Iq levels and it's,</v>

233
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.780
yeah.
And I cue levels on children and the higher the level of fluoride was,

234
00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:18.990
it corresponded with lower Iq rates.
And Joe's like a conspiracy.
Joe,

235
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.120
I don't know if it's a good thing or if I think there's a legitimate,

236
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.390
there's a legitimate belief that there's a conspiracy for maintaining fluoride

237
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:31.680
in water.
Well,
who the fuck doesn't have toothpaste?

238
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.770
<v 1>Well,
it's,
it's a guy who worked at,
um,</v>

239
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.130
I saw a story recently works at,
um,

240
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.140
in Sacramento I think for the water treatment and hid heath.

241
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.020
He quit his job because of that.

242
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.640
And he's an advocate for take the flow right out of this water.
We need it.

243
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.220
You're ruining our kids.
You ruin.
And you know,
it's like the health problems.
Um,

244
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.800
but I,
it's too many.
That's what I'm saying to me,
you asked as a conspiracy.

245
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.190
It's too perfect dude.
There's too many people benefiting.

246
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:05.120
There's too many people benefiting from these kids and not being educated,

247
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.660
you know,
has the industrial prison industrial complex.
We got the,

248
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.830
the medical industrial complex,
the military industrial complex.
I mean,

249
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.750
we got too many complexes that in big ag that are benefiting man,

250
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.640
you know,
um,
and what we're paying for this food and where it comes from,

251
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.970
you know,
I,
I don't need,
I don't need my,
you know,

252
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:29.830
my tangerines to come from Cameroon or some damn place,
you know,

253
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.380
<v 3>especially in La.
Yeah.
I'm here all year round.
Yeah.
Gross Shit.</v>

254
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.750
All you need then as somebody you can't grow.

255
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.830
I got bananas growing on the street in front of my house and I had a doctor,

256
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:44.510
it's like,
you can't grow bananas in,
in La.
I'm like,
yeah,
Dude,

257
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.100
stop.
You know,
he's a doctor.
So I had to like,
yeah,

258
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.160
this is on the street,
dude.
You see that?
You know,
it's ironic.

259
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:54.620
One of the few things he can't grow in America.
It's cocaine,
right?

260
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.530
The climate wise,
it doesn't grow here.
It's like one of our big problems.
Oh,

261
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:05.300
is it a problem?
That'd be the opposite.
It's a problem that we have it here.

262
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.930
Like cocaine is a problem in the United States.
They can't even be grown here.

263
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.070
Is it still the problem?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
That's always going to be a problem.

264
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.840
Or you did you think that's by design?

265
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.110
I think definitely there's an issue with legalization because adults should be

266
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:23.120
able to do whatever the fuck they want.
I think you can go into cvs,

267
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:24.400
you can buy whiskey,
you know,

268
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.250
you could buy enough whiskey to drink yourself to death.
Literally.
Any,

269
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.780
any problem?
No,
no problem with her.

270
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:34.010
Or you can get a doctor to give you a prescription for a bottle of pills and

271
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:36.950
who's to stop you from just throwing the whole thing down your throat with that

272
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.680
whiskey and killing yourself.
No one can stop you if you're alone,

273
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.000
but yet they want to shield you from marijuana,
which has never killed anybody.

274
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.900
Mushrooms just never killed anybody.
All those things are schedule one drugs,

275
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.010
which are much more illegal than those pills or that alcohol,

276
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.360
which is ridiculous.

277
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:58.361
And that's clearly by design and in place clearly because there's a thing called

278
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.080
the,
um,
the,
the,
you know,
there's the,
ever see those commercials,

279
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.850
a partnership for drug free America.

280
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.270
They got millions of dollars from alcohol,

281
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:11.600
tobacco and pharmaceutical companies,
which is hilarious.

282
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.720
It's hilarious that drugs are spending money to keep other drugs that are less

283
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:21.550
harmful.
Illegal.
I did a joke about it.

284
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.160
I said this like hookers doing commercials against strippers.
It's,

285
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:28.340
it really is what stripper stripper is the gateway drug

286
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.780
and they are,
but that's a conspiracy for sure.
I mean they,

287
00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:39.320
they actively conspired to keep marijuana and other drugs and aren't as

288
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:40.154
dangerous.

289
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.840
<v 1>Hang is,
how did the drugs get here?
You know,
I mean,
come on,
it's,</v>

290
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.580
it's too many.
It's too much.

291
00:17:47.581 --> 00:17:52.560
The wait is way much for this drugs and just all of a sudden find a place where

292
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:56.910
they find them.
Man,
this is stop.
You know,
that that whole outlet,

293
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:00.310
that whole Ollie north,
you know.
Dang.
Yeah.

294
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.720
<v 3>Freeway,
Rick Ross.
I haven't,
I've had him on the podcast couple of times.</v>

295
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.020
I mean he told the story about how he brought the drugs in through the help of

296
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.490
the CIA.
I got you can't say anything.
No,
I can,

297
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:14.490
but I'll tell you later later.

298
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.170
I can't tell you.
Sorry.
Yeah.
But there's,

299
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.490
there's obviously there's a lot of issues with people trying to protect the

300
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:27.120
money that they make and it against the,

301
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:28.800
the greater good of mankind.

302
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.190
And that's what you believe is going on with the urban farming.

303
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.550
And the reason why this,
the,
these,
these cities are set up the way they are.

304
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.740
<v 1>Well,
you see it.
I mean,
you,
you see it,
uh,
uh,
it's,
it's just like I said,</v>

305
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:46.830
you go from one place to the next place,
to the next place.
Then it's like,

306
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.040
and you realize,
Oh shit,
this is by design.
It can't,
it just can't.

307
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.280
Why is this the same as it is in Euston?

308
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.110
Has It is in Philadelphia,
has it,
is in Louisiana,

309
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.680
you know,
it's coming on.
It's,
it's,
it's totally,
and there's like,

310
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.210
there's no money that the whole no money thing.
It's bullshit.
You know,

311
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.210
if there was no money there,
the corporations that are there,

312
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:15.240
the medical corporations that are there,
you know,
wouldn't be there.

313
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.720
And they have,
they're putting people on these drugs and you will take it

314
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.480
<v 3>this for the rest of your fucking lives.</v>

315
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.790
And there's a lot of money in those drugs.
Come on,
stop.

316
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.440
<v 1>Yeah.
I tell people you don't need drugs.
You need a garden.
You know?
It's true.</v>

317
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.190
<v 3>And,
and a lot of ways it's true.</v>

318
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220
There's a myth that that's a thing about nutrition when it comes to doctors that

319
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:38.430
very few doctors have a long or prolonged education on nutrition.

320
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.410
They know very little.
I know it's shocking troop that you bring that up.

321
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.273
It's like,
like,

322
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.980
<v 1>so Mike,
some I've talked to doctors.
Ah,
we had maybe a week.</v>

323
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.980
<v 3>Yeah.
Nutrition,
nutrition,</v>

324
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.010
<v 1>just what you put in your body to make you healthy.</v>

325
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.240
And you've only had a few hours in class on that.

326
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.100
<v 3>Well,
this is the way I try to tell people to look at it.
When they're skeptical.</v>

327
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.430
The only thing that you take into your body to help your body recover and grow

328
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.910
is food.
That's it.
There's nothing else that goes in there that makes your body,

329
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.640
the devil ought to health except water.

330
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.560
The health of your body is directly related to the nutrients you take in.

331
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.600
If you have less nutrients like the reason why,
you know,
I mean your,

332
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.740
if your body doesn't have enough calcium,

333
00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:30.570
we'll start pulling it out of your bones and you'll get osteoporosis.
This all,

334
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:33.130
all sorts of ailments.
Selenium,

335
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.700
a lack of selenium has been directly related to strokes.

336
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.480
There's all sorts of essential minerals,
trace minerals that you,

337
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.680
a lot of times people are not even getting from the food that they buy in stores

338
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.190
and all of these are necessary to have a complete healthy,

339
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:53.110
balanced body,
right?
And if you don't have those things,

340
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.200
your body starts going haywire and that's where diabetes comes in.

341
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:57.850
That's where all sorts of diseases come in.

342
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.660
All sorts of cancers are directly related to nutritional deficiencies.

343
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.920
There's all of that can be avoided at least to a certain extent by healthy food.

344
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.310
<v 1>It is.
But I mean in that,
and then you ask,
is it by design?</v>

345
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.830
Of course you got a kid in elementary school and they start from day one eat and

346
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:18.110
shit.
You know what I'm saying?
And then throughout their life they eat and shit.

347
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.000
Now you've compromised their bodies,

348
00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:24.230
you compromise their brains and and in their DNA has changed because of this

349
00:21:24.231 --> 00:21:28.100
food.
Food is as opposed to be alive,
you know,
and,

350
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:31.610
and when you grow it,
I think that's what I teach.
That's what I say.

351
00:21:31.611 --> 00:21:35.570
If kids grow Kale,
they eat care because they see the connection.
They see,

352
00:21:35.571 --> 00:21:39.410
I planted this little bitty ass scene and now I have this and I can eat it.

353
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.730
So there's a connection there.
There's a connection.
Soil is alive dude.

354
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.990
And people don't realize that.
People don't risk,
oh,
that's dirt.
No,
that's,
no,

355
00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:52.610
that's dirt.
But this is soil and this shit is having sex 24 hours a day.

356
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.090
There's this shit happening in the soil.
It's the same thing with water.

357
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.780
We think Wa water is an organism that's alive,

358
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.830
but w we don't look at it like that and I always do.
A lot of times when I,

359
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.730
when I do talks,
I ask people say,
what's the most important thing to your life?

360
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.280
And um,
they'll like,
oh my,
my,
my husband,
my dog,
my,
you know,

361
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:17.470
my baby Mama.
And then no one ever says like joke.

362
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:20.930
What's the most important thing to your life?
The most important?

363
00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:23.090
The most important out of everything.

364
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.560
<v 3>Health.
No.
Air.
Air is the most important thing.</v>

365
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.100
You're fucking,
if you're on food here,
food,
you should none.

366
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.630
Mr Mma,
you should know.
Okay,

367
00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:41.160
somebody put your ass in a choke hold and you got all the blood because the

368
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.540
blood off your brain,
which that's what a choke hold does.

369
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:47.360
A lot of people think it's cutting the air off.
It's actually,

370
00:22:47.361 --> 00:22:50.430
if you can't hold your breath for a long time,
if I choke you,

371
00:22:50.431 --> 00:22:52.730
you're going out pretty quick.
You can only,

372
00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:55.800
you get choked out in like two or three seconds.
It's pretty well,

373
00:22:55.801 --> 00:23:00.801
some people can't go without air for for like 30 seconds to a minute.

374
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.290
Let me tell you something.
If someone's choking you for a minute,

375
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.210
like holding onto a choke,
you're fucking done.
You're done is a big difference.

376
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:12.500
Treat of holding your breath.
You can hold your breath for a minute.
No,
exactly.

377
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.950
But because people who done it for like 20 David Blaine do some crazy stunt,

378
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.180
they did it for like 15 skin divers,
deep dive free divers.

379
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.810
<v 1>But I'm saying to people,
nobody thinks of air,</v>

380
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.050
so we're not taught how to breathe ever.
You know,

381
00:23:28.051 --> 00:23:31.470
unless you go to some yoga classes,
I mean,
you know them.
You realize.

382
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.910
So everybody takes Air Force for granted to me.
They never bring it up.

383
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:39.780
It's like damn without air.
And I think it's because you can't see it.
Right.

384
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.440
You know?
So it's not that important unless you're flying to Mexico City or,
or,

385
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.830
or China

386
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.330
<v 2>or Singapore.
Right.
Did you see that shit?
I posted on Twitter.
Oh my God.</v>

387
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.320
Take a look at this.

388
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.700
There was a thing that I posted on Twitter today where they're,

389
00:23:53.701 --> 00:23:56.240
they're talking about,
I think it's Singapore,
was it Singapore,

390
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.460
Shanghai or some shit,
some place in an Asian country.

391
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.610
Beijing.
That's what it is.
That's fucked up.

392
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.290
And there they got to the point where everybody's walking around with gas masks

393
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:12.650
on.
Their city is toxic and they're forced to live there.
They're stuck.

394
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.210
And then somehow or another in this quest to make money and industry look at

395
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:21.260
these,
uh,
these images.
Watch as he scrolls down.
Look at this fucking town man.

396
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.970
But you can't see any,
you know,
you see like a hundred yards and that's it.

397
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.040
<v 1>Those are not gas mass either though.
Oh Damn.
You got a baby with a gap.</v>

398
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.720
A righteous gas masks on.

399
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.620
<v 2>Yeah.
It's fucked.
And those kids are going to get super state.
Yeah.</v>

400
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.220
<v 1>So now they're using gas masks</v>

401
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.650
<v 2>cause the king,
they wanted a marathon with a gas mask off.</v>

402
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.510
<v 1>Look at that beautiful architecture and you have to,
and the heirs</v>

403
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.680
<v 2>that,
but you could only see like a hundred yards out.</v>

404
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.210
Everything after that is just in the fog.
And that,
look at that.
That's insane.

405
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.250
Dude.
I flew into Mexico City recently and it tripped me the fuck out.
I've,

406
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.610
I flew into Mexico City and I took pictures and I put into my Twitter.
I'm like,

407
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:04.570
this is crazy.
You fly,
it looks like there's a fire.
Right.

408
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.690
You know how like when La sometimes like over the one on one,
they have those,

409
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.750
those fires that we will start making their way down.

410
00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:13.930
And if you're anywhere near there,
it's like,
it's like you're in a cloud.

411
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.430
It's all just smoke.
That's what it looks like in Mexico City.
It's fucking crazy.

412
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.820
It's been scared to go to Mexico three.
I mean,

413
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.360
<v 1>I mean,</v>

414
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.170
even the ruins they found underground where they built the city over these,

415
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.500
you know,
these ruins,
uh,
you know,
and I was,

416
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.270
I mean I had one point and had property over Mexico,
but it's,
I don't know,

417
00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.550
Mexico City was just always scared the shit out of them.

418
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.900
<v 2>Well,
it's really crazy as far as traffic,</v>

419
00:25:37.901 --> 00:25:40.960
but that's what it looks like when you fly in and crazy.

420
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.790
That took that shit from the plane.

421
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.360
That photo was just regular photo from the plane.

422
00:25:46.361 --> 00:25:48.680
I took a few of them cause I couldn't believe it.
It's crazy.

423
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:50.080
It's like you see the amount of pollution,

424
00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:53.530
like this is madness and there it is right there off of my Instagram.

425
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:58.030
And then on top of it,
what's really crazy is the gridlock.
It's,
you know,

426
00:25:58.031 --> 00:26:02.500
sometimes in La there's some assholes that the lights turning yellow and they

427
00:26:02.501 --> 00:26:04.810
still weasel their way into the intersection.
They block it off.

428
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.560
Everybody else in Mexico,
that's all they do.
That's all they do.

429
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.530
There's all gridlock all the time.
There's gridlock this way.

430
00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:13.570
There's gridlock that way and the light turns green,

431
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.720
light turns red and nobody's going anywhere and they just kind of weaseling in

432
00:26:16.721 --> 00:26:19.720
front of each other and everybody's trying to get ahead and no one gets
anywhere.

433
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.940
And you're like,
this is crazy.
Wow.

434
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.360
But then not honking at each other and they're super chill about it.

435
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.270
But it's normal for them.
It's so normal for them.
Who

436
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.120
<v 1>wants that to be an arm?
I mean,
and I think that's what happens with with,</v>

437
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.600
I think that's what happens with these kids.
And a lot of these neighborhoods,

438
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.180
it'd be,
it'd be that situation becomes normal.
I mean,
with me,
you know,

439
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.170
people were asking me,
why did I start growing food?

440
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.490
It took me a while because it becomes,
I have to do this to get this.

441
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.190
So what you do Joe,
that's what I do.
I do that.

442
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.950
But you don't realize how it's lunacy.

443
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:55.420
You don't realize why the fuck I need to do this,
you know,

444
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.640
why do I have to go out of my area to get healthy food?
You know,
when it's like,

445
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.370
Whoa,
it should be right here.
I shouldn't have to do this.

446
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.670
<v 2>Got You started on this path.
Like how to do what it was,</v>

447
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:07.470
the first thing that you planted.

448
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.540
<v 1>I mean,
you know,
we've got,</v>

449
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.780
we can go back to elementary school when we had the petri dishes,

450
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:16.170
when you put the seeds with the Brown paper towel and you watch them grow on the

451
00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:20.010
side of the Petri dish and you plant them and you got beans.
I mean,
uh,

452
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.010
the thing here,
it wasn't nowhere being in the city.
And I,
you know,

453
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:26.810
I grew up in south central,
there was really nowhere to plant person.

454
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.150
We had stuff growing in the yard and the yard occasionally,
but it wasn't,

455
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:34.350
it wasn't something that,
you know,
that we was,
hey,
let's get in the garden.

456
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.320
What were,
what did it to me has an adult.

457
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:42.210
I remember going to the store and there was a tomato and it's,
you know,

458
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.170
and it's had a label on,
it says coated with Shellac,
you know,

459
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:49.800
to preserve and Alex your lack,
that's the shit.
We use them.
What shop for the,

460
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:53.620
you know,
for the wood when we,
you know,
set lack really,
dude,

461
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.110
they coat tomatoes with this tomato said coated with Shellac.

462
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.980
And I'm like,
damn,
when the last,
I ain't heard that word since the 70s,
you know,

463
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.270
and I'm like,
I'm cool.
And that kind of,
that was one of the things,
I mean,

464
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:10.440
I've always been,
um,
you know,
somewhat healthy.
I mean,
I had a brother that was,

465
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:10.980
uh,

466
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.980
used to have like Barrow 50 Gallon barrels of Spiralina plankton,

467
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:19.830
you know,
back in the day.
And so I was around it,
you know,

468
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:23.610
we used to go up the Antilles was one of the biggest health food stores here.

469
00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:27.130
It used to be and um,
Pacific design center man.

470
00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:30.690
And that was the place to go to pick up girls.
So uh,
you know,

471
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:34.310
to the health food store.
So um,
I've been in it but this,
that,

472
00:28:34.311 --> 00:28:35.640
that's basically what did it.

473
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.310
I remember that tomato and I'm like this is not cool.

474
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.790
<v 2>This is crazy.
This is a paper that was written on it.</v>

475
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[inaudible] Vera Base Gel surface coating for shelf life extension of tomatoes.

476
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.220
That is insane.
Sassy.
See don't you love the Internet?

477
00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:57.221
Sometimes at the abstract shall lack whatever that means.

478
00:28:58.321 --> 00:28:59.420
I'm an Aloe Vera Gel.

479
00:28:59.421 --> 00:29:04.421
We used to develop an edible surface coatings for shelf life extension of tomato

480
00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:05.151
fruits.

481
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:10.151
The coding was prepared by dissolving d waxed and bleach shall act in an

482
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.630
alkaline acquiesce medium as such,

483
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.920
as such as well as in combination with a g incorporation of agg and soul

484
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.080
[inaudible] coding improve permeability characteristics of the coding.

485
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.040
What the fuck is all of that?
That's so crazy.

486
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.440
That is fucking quick.

487
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.500
<v 1>I mean,
I remember that like,
like it was just,</v>

488
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.900
<v 2>did they,
oh my God,
I never heard of that before.</v>

489
00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.190
<v 1>And I was just like,
and then,
you know,
you</v>

490
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.900
<v 2>just wake up and you realize that all this stuff does not need to be in our</v>

491
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:51.280
food.
You know,
the high fructose corn syrup,
the stuff and might have a thing.

492
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:55.740
You know,
I,
I do a thing with these kids sometimes when I,
when I taught at,
um,

493
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.700
at schools and uh,
I'll bring snacks and I said,
no,

494
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.040
but you can't eat them.
I said,
I want you to get on your phones,

495
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:06.670
get on your computers.
I want you to tell me what these ingredients are,
you know?

496
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:09.700
And they'll say,
oh,
this is is,

497
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:14.701
I'm such and such and it's related to hypertension and diabetes and Dada.

498
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.110
And they'll get another one.
Oh,
cancer doctor.

499
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.250
And somebody always comes up with this line that they can't read.

500
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.670
The word is so damn long that they can't five bus as a perfect you were,

501
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.120
you're the one I was waiting for.
It's real simple.
If you can't read that shit,

502
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.860
don't eat that shit.
Nothing,

503
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.930
nothing in nature that I know of that there's adequate has 16 letters.

504
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:40.420
You know what I'm saying?
So it's real simple,
man.

505
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:42.730
And you just go on a thing and you're like,
wow,
damn,

506
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:44.600
they straight trying to kill us.
You know what?

507
00:30:44.601 --> 00:30:47.980
That's when you realize it's like you got,
they're putting poison in the food.

508
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:51.790
Why?
When you can have,
and then the stuff is cheaper then.

509
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.260
Then oil like potato chips,
oil,
potatoes and salt.

510
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.690
Okay,
but you have a potato chip that has this,

511
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.660
this category of stuff and it's less than an oil.
Why is that?

512
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.950
Don't they have to buy barrels of that bullshit?

513
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.410
Shouldn't it be more money instead of less money?
Well,

514
00:31:07.411 --> 00:31:08.760
there's government subsidies,

515
00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:12.020
which is where it gets really weird when it comes to corn that you know,

516
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.820
every corn farmer,
if they grew corn,

517
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.160
the way they're growing it right now without government subsidies,

518
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.620
they'd lose money and they'd stop growing corn.

519
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.770
They get money from the government to grow corn.

520
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.120
If you've never heard of this before,

521
00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:27.300
you got to watch a fascinating documentary called king corn.

522
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.410
I urge everybody out here who's like never seen King Kong.

523
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.360
It's amazing.
It starts out with these guys.
They go and they get their,
their,

524
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.710
their body tested like their blood tests and,

525
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.910
and it turns out that like most of the carbon in their body comes from corn and

526
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:47.410
then they start carbon.
Yeah.
All the,
like literally like that the,

527
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.210
the building blocks of your body,
like the food that you take in.

528
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.340
And like I just tweeted something,
uh,

529
00:31:53.341 --> 00:31:57.140
earlier today from my friend Lee camp who's a standup comedian,
is also,
uh,

530
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.111
an activist.

531
00:31:58.111 --> 00:32:03.111
And one of the things that he tweeted today was about how two out of three

532
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.870
corners,
oh,
three out of four items in the grocery store contain corn.
Yep.

533
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.560
That's fucking crazy.

534
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.750
<v 1>Genetically Modified corn.</v>

535
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.020
<v 2>Well that's also,
well,
almost all corn is genetically modified.</v>

536
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:19.120
If you go back to the original corn,
it depends.

537
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.850
It depends on what you consider genetically modified.

538
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.630
Whether it's in a lab where they're splicing genes or whether it's just the way

539
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:28.690
they've,
you know,
they've changed all sorts of,
yeah.
Hybrids.

540
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:32.950
And they've changed all sorts of plants over the years to make them yield more.

541
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:37.270
And corn used to be like a scrubby little vegetables are very small and now it's

542
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:39.070
this big fucking healthy thing.

543
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.560
But the crazy thing is a lot of the corn that there's,
these people are growing.

544
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:47.090
You can't even eat it.
Yeah.
It tastes like shit.
Well,
a lot of it's for fuel now.

545
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:52.060
Yes.
For fuel or for feed for cows,

546
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:56.660
sick when cows are supposed to be eating grass,
you know,
bizarre.

547
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.400
<v 1>I tell people,
I said,
you,
you're,
you're,
you know,
I started with soil.
I mean,</v>

548
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:02.810
I started,
I made compost.

549
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:06.110
Compost to me is one of the most sexiest thing on the planet,
you know,

550
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:10.070
cause it's like,
that literally makes my nipples hard when I make compost.

551
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.550
And,
um,
and,

552
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.860
and I tell people,
so your plants eat soil,
they don't just grow in it.

553
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.440
That's where their nutrients come from.
So you need healthy soil.

554
00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:27.140
So basically to meet you,
you know,
they tell us you are what you eat.
It's like,

555
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:32.090
no,
you are what you eat,
eats,
you know,
literally.
So with the cows,

556
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.090
they're supposed to be eating grass.
That's what,
that's what they're do.

557
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:39.800
But now we're feeding them corn,
we're feeding them all this other stuff.
And um,

558
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.293
can they,

559
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.810
are they digesting this the way you know that they were meant to digest?

560
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.880
<v 2>No,
you're,
you're eating animals that have been fucked with.
Yeah.</v>

561
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.120
That's why they're so fat.

562
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:54.250
The thing about the difference between wild game and like a cow that you buy

563
00:33:54.251 --> 00:33:57.790
from a grocery store is that the cows have these layers of fat,

564
00:33:57.791 --> 00:34:01.900
which makes it delicious when you cook them.
Cause it's all juicy and fat,

565
00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:05.050
but easy,
easy.
But it's not really very good for you.

566
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:09.130
It's just all that extra fat.
It's just,
it's unnecessary.

567
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.290
And grass fed beef I think tastes better.
I mean I buy grass fed beef.

568
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:17.060
It's leaner buffalo.
Yeah,
it doesn't,
you know,
you,

569
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.310
it cooks quicker but it's a,
it's a better meat.
It tastes better.

570
00:34:21.311 --> 00:34:22.870
You get used to that flavor.

571
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.960
But some people use that corn fed sick flavor of beef.

572
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.100
<v 1>Well,
I think,
like I was saying with the kids,</v>

573
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:31.310
with their DNA being compromised with this food,

574
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.570
now their taste buds are adjusted for this garbage,
you know?

575
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:38.210
So when you give them real food,
it's like,
that's nasty

576
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.270
<v 2>moose.
You ever have moose?
That fucker over there?</v>

577
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:44.750
I shot that one a couple of weeks ago.
I left.
Yeah.
Oh,

578
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.830
you don't even know Dan really liked that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had a treated,
yeah,

579
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:51.950
he cut all the meat off of it and then you boil the head,

580
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.150
there's a wire in the back.
You scramble the brains and pull it out the back.

581
00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.550
Yeah,
that's it.
Worse.
Where do you get time for all this shit?
I find it right.

582
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.520
Find time I make it.
I don't really have time.

583
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:05.990
I somehow or another just do shit.

584
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.810
And then I have a bunch of people scrambling after me trying to get ahold of me,

585
00:35:08.811 --> 00:35:13.270
but I'm out of cell phone range,
shoot animals.
But I,

586
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.340
my goal was by the end of 2014 to have all the meat in my house from wild game.

587
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.370
And I'm there because I have 400 pounds of Moose in my freezer.

588
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:25.990
Because of that most,
you'll never even seen moose on a menu.
Nowhere.
It's,

589
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.420
we can't get it commercially.
It's only available in the wild.

590
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:32.660
Like you literally cannot buy it commercially.
You can't,
he can't sell it.

591
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:33.494
You can't buy it.

592
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.010
In some countries they sell and by elk in America,
the only way you could buy El,

593
00:35:39.011 --> 00:35:42.390
cause most of it comes from New Zealand where they allow it in New Zealand,

594
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:45.300
they grow these animals over there,
but there's no predators.

595
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.970
So New Zealand has like no regulations on hunting.

596
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.040
You could just go in there and like any,

597
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:53.940
you could go there right now and shoot a ton of elk,
shoot geese.

598
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:56.250
You could shoot anything the fuck you want.
You don't need tags.

599
00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:00.330
And the reason being is they have an over abundance of these game animals.

600
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:02.430
I like very precious here.
Yeah.

601
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:06.300
Like in America or in Canada where I shot that these animals are regulated.

602
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:08.460
Like you can't just go and shoot them.

603
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.330
You have to have a tag and they limit the amount of tags that people get every

604
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:14.220
year.
So like if they,
they've,

605
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.070
they monitor the population from the air and the ground,

606
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.740
they don't want to make sure that they know pretty,

607
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.200
pretty close to exact how many animals are in the area and they,

608
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.410
that that way they issue tags and the tags being how many animals you're allowed

609
00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:27.550
to do

610
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.430
<v 3>kill.
How do you get it back to United States?
Well,</v>

611
00:36:30.431 --> 00:36:33.010
I had a guy drive that back for me from it,
from Canada.

612
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.500
So a long process if it wasn't for,
uh,

613
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.500
for him driving it back when had to ship it and it's really expensive,

614
00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:40.270
but it's expensive to have someone drive it back to.

615
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.420
And then the one on the right,
that's a mule deer from Montana,

616
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.830
I shot that won a couple of years ago.
That was the first animal ever shot.

617
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:52.390
And that was like,
that was only about 90 pounds.

618
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:56.860
It was 180 pound animal,
maybe about 70,
70 to 90 pounds of actual meat.

619
00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:01.150
Did you have to stock them?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Both of them.
You have to stalk them.
Yeah.

620
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.080
Yeah.
You got to sneak up on them.

621
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.580
You got to make sure you're in the right area of the wind.

622
00:37:06.581 --> 00:37:08.200
Can't be blowing towards them.

623
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.350
You want to make the wind blown in your face so that they can't smell you.

624
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.360
That's the thing is smell you.
They don't know what the fuck you are saying.

625
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.590
If they had an ar 15 and yo ass side of that,

626
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.510
what would that make the Shit Lou?
Cause they antler thing.
They too far.

627
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.330
<v 2>Listen,
I'm not always,</v>

628
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.280
people always want to say talk about like things being even,

629
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.840
I'm not interested in even.
Okay.
I'm interested in eating at us.
Okay.

630
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:37.070
This whole idea,
is it fair the pressure rifle does?
No,
it's not fair at all.

631
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.260
I'm a cheater.
I'm 100% cheating.
I shot a bear with a bow and Arrow too.

632
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:45.390
I'm going to meet and bear stu tonight.
Bear on the real real.
Yeah.

633
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.090
I'll show the pictures under real kind of bear.
Black bear.

634
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.480
Black bears are delicious.
What would that and in the valley that was in Canada,

635
00:37:53.481 --> 00:37:57.210
in the valley,
that was in Canada.
That was in Canada.
Beer.

636
00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.490
You shout a receipt receded,
fuck around.
You know he bears.

637
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.970
That's a gay dude in receipt.
That's the Moose right there.
Yeah,

638
00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:07.640
that's the Moose I showed a couple of weeks ago.
But I'll show you the bear.

639
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.550
And you know a lot of people have these ideas about bears that are based on like

640
00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:12.770
Yogi and Booboo,
right?
Let me,

641
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.090
let me explain to anybody who thinks that bears these cuddly,
cute animals.

642
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.751
First of all,

643
00:38:17.751 --> 00:38:22.340
bears will fucking kill you 100% not only would they kill you,

644
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:26.450
one of the reasons why you have to kill bears like mature boars,

645
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.070
is to keep the bear population healthy because bears eat bears and one of the

646
00:38:31.071 --> 00:38:34.940
things they do is the,
the male bears loved eat cubs stars.

647
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.060
The cubs can't get away.
They're all cannibals.

648
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.170
That's one of the most fucked up thing about bears is that they're almost 100%

649
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:45.970
cannibals.
So their DNA is,
it's kind of Funky,
but it's,
you know,

650
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:50.410
it's survival there.
It tastes like a pig fucked a deer.

651
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.130
That's what it tastes like.
It's like a combination between a pig and a deer.

652
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.750
How would you know that,
Joe?
That's my bear.

653
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.520
That's the bare of shot.
Wow.
Yeah.
Shut that with the you guys bear dude.

654
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:04.840
Well that's,

655
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.890
that's it's close to fair as it gets a bow and Arrow with a bear crossbow.

656
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.900
No regular content on bow.
I mean it's not really fair.
No,
it's not fair.

657
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:17.100
You get to do barrier camel flash shit and be in a tree and all that.

658
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.200
Just talking all that shit.
Actually,
we were on the ground,

659
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.010
but a problem with shooting in a tree is,
um,

660
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.400
you're shooting down and one of the things about a bear is you want to make sure

661
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:30.460
you go straight through both of the lungs to kill him like that,

662
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.820
that you shoot through both lungs.
They're dead in 30 seconds.

663
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.600
Within 30 seconds they're gone.
But when you shoot down,

664
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.990
sometimes if you're shooting at an angle,
you're going to get one lung.

665
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.980
They might survive.
They'd be like really badly wounded and get away.
So it's,

666
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.610
especially with a bow and Arrow,
it was very important that you're very accurate.

667
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.500
You've got to practice like a motherfucker.

668
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:55.270
I was practicing hours every day shooting 150 hours a day every day getting

669
00:39:55.271 --> 00:39:58.630
ready for this hunt.
So,
and that was,
that's a rifle.

670
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.990
You shoot a moose with a rifle,
boom.
That soccer was down in seconds.

671
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.030
But I'm doing it for a couple reasons.
One for the meat,

672
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.660
because the meat is delicious and is the only way to get moose meat unless you

673
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:13.750
know somebody who should.
I wish I knew.
I should have brought some for you man.

674
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:18.760
And bear me.
I mean,
yeah,
that's crazy.
Yeah,
it's good.
Bear me is good.

675
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.720
We're just not exposed.

676
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:22.420
If you talk to people that live in Canada that live up there,

677
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:24.700
that hunt them on a regular basis or Alaska,

678
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.790
people that hunt them on a regular basis.
Like when we were in Canada,

679
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:30.670
when I was heading in Moose camp,
we ate a a bear roast.

680
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.210
We had a bear roast while we're up there.
It's good.
It tastes good.

681
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:37.420
It's an interesting,
neat.
So what do they would have bears eat?
No.

682
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:40.170
What do Lucy Moose,
those are herbivores,
you know,

683
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:44.020
so they're all eating grass and you know,
different leaves and they get that big.

684
00:40:44.021 --> 00:40:47.650
They are,
I know our mess.
That was 900 pounds and that wasn't even a big one.

685
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.800
I mean,
you look at his antlers,
that's not even a big moose.
My Buddy,

686
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:55.570
my buddy Ben,
he shot one that was about 1400 pounds while we were there.

687
00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.640
It was fucking huge.
That thing walked down into the road.
We were,
we were,

688
00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:04.330
we were driving actually on the way to spot where we're going to hunt and this

689
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:08.050
fucker just walked out onto the road and we were like,
Holy Shit.

690
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.670
It was huge.

691
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:14.100
Just towering over the truck that we were in and he jumped out and he shouted at

692
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.090
like 240 yards from the road.
Yeah.

693
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.720
But my point is like,
that's the type of animals we're supposed to be eating.

694
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.470
I was feeling shitty the other day.
He killed Bambi.
He's Dad fucker.

695
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.340
That's not bammies dad.
Bambi is a cartoon.
Yeah.

696
00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:34.070
Bombies if I didn't kill Bambi,
his dad,
he would have gotten his asshole eaten by

697
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.610
<v 3>coyotes.
They would eat them.
Asshole first.
I'll show you videos.</v>

698
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.490
That's how they do it.
They,
they attack the legs,

699
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.810
they pull the hamstrings apart to the deer can't get away and they start chewing

700
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:48.980
on the asshole.
I'm not kidding.
Maybe that's where all the flavor is.
It must be.

701
00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:52.320
Yeah.
I don't think they have good tastes.
Right.

702
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.070
The point is if you don't do it,
it's not like they're going to live forever.

703
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.660
Like everybody has this idea that these animals are beautiful.

704
00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:02.680
Are you going in there?
Kill him.
They're going to die,

705
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.740
flowed over us.

706
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:10.180
It's a fuck load of us to Joe and we're going to fucking die people.

707
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.520
Okay,
I'm here for me.
They're not there for you.

708
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.060
They don't give a fuck if they not fucking with you.
Do.
Oh,
but they would.

709
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:21.350
If you were wandering through the woods,
why wouldn't you be?

710
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.050
Why should they be allowed to want it to the woods and you can't,

711
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.280
oh my cause team people,
team people.
Ron.

712
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.070
Okay,
I'm not on team.
Bear bears.
Don't give a fuck about you.
Yeah,

713
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.620
Ben,
they're delicious with you in their territory.

714
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.740
What's mine and around this hippie mother fucker know they're turning around in

715
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.250
his mind.
You know why?
Because I'm a human.
Yeah.
It's,

716
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.400
if I have a tag and it's legal and the humans have deemed at the numbers need to

717
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:52.790
be dropped,
that's legal.
That's my territory.

718
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.250
If I'm out there with the right,
that's how you have to think.

719
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:59.310
If you want to bring back that meat or are you a vegetarian by no,
stretch it on.

720
00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.390
There you go.
So what are you doing?
You getting food from a supermarket?
Hitman.

721
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.530
That's where you're doing weird.
No,
no.
My Shit is,

722
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.970
I get my shit from some guys that raise it.
The older guys personally.

723
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.290
So you have a relationship with farmers.
They grow grass fed meat.
No doubt.

724
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:19.430
So you'd all healthy stuff tried to,
yeah.
Yeah.
No,
that's the most healthy though.

725
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.200
That's the game I was telling you.
I wasn't feeling good.

726
00:43:22.201 --> 00:43:23.650
And the other day I was feeling kind of rundown.

727
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.140
I cooked myself a moose steak and when you eat it,
you're like,
whoa.

728
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:31.970
So do you,
do you butchered the shit to photos?
I'll show you.
I got proof.

729
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:33.830
I saw this woman,
man,

730
00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:37.940
she posted some pictures on Facebook where she laid out cable and they brought

731
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:40.730
up a deer or something in and right there on the table and they,

732
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:45.200
they chopped it up and made 'em deer steaks and shit.
Yeah,

733
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:48.660
that's how you do it.
Yeah.
It takes a long time,
but that's how you do it.
Okay.

734
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.580
And when you do the classes to duty Shit,
I got super lucky.

735
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.920
And then I learned from some hunters,
you know,

736
00:43:54.921 --> 00:43:57.140
I learned from some real experience guys.

737
00:43:57.141 --> 00:43:59.720
My friend Steve Rinella was the first one that takes me out hunting.

738
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.220
That's where I got that mule deer.

739
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.940
And he has a TV show that's on the outdoor network called meat eater.
And,
um,

740
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.200
what you do is,
you know,
you,

741
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.150
you essentially do what people have done for thousands of years.

742
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:14.420
She'd take the skin off and you cut it into meal size portions.
I mean,

743
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:18.350
that's what it's all about.
Do you guys use the skin?
Ah,
you can,

744
00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.000
you know something.
You guys use the skin,
Joe?
No,
I didn't use this again.
No,

745
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.370
I mean you can,
but I don't have any use for it really.

746
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.430
But if you leave it in the woods,
it gets eaten.
I mean it,

747
00:44:29.431 --> 00:44:32.100
it's not like it goes to waste.
Animals eat it.

748
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.880
<v 2>I mean,
there'll be rodents and all sorts of animals that eat it.
I mean,</v>

749
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.580
it's a part of the,
when you,
anything you leave behind,

750
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.800
it becomes a part of the ecosystem.

751
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.630
The idea that it goes to waste being composed.
Yeah,
it does.
We turn the compost,

752
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.110
everything.
That's why I said everything turns to compost.
Everything.

753
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.750
It doesn't even just turn the compost animals eat it.

754
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:56.450
Like if you leave behind the bones,
wolves will come and pick the bone.
The park,

755
00:44:56.451 --> 00:45:01.230
coyotes will come.
You know,
th the cycle is,
is enormous.
I mean,

756
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.350
the cycle of life is enormous.

757
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:07.110
So like I would prefer if I could use every part of the animal,
like the bear.

758
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:09.840
I have the rug,
it's coming to me and the bear skin rug.

759
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.470
I'll use that in my house,
you know?
But,
um,
the,

760
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.160
if you leave stuff behind,
it's not going to waste.
Animals are going to eat it.

761
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.390
You know,
it's all a part of this.
The continuous cycle.
No dough.

762
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.910
My point being those animals are as healthy as you're ever going to get.

763
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:27.420
I mean they,
there's no antibiotics,
no human intervention whatsoever.

764
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:29.640
They are as close to nature as possible.

765
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:33.120
The problem is with 300 million Americans there,

766
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.210
there's not enough game animals for everybody.
Just be out.

767
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.890
But that doesn't stop you or me or anybody else who really wants to do it.

768
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.340
If you really want to put in the effort,
you can acquire your own meat.

769
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.930
I've seen these guys that that's how they,
like with the Buffalo,

770
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:53.460
they literally have a truck that they take,
right?

771
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.040
Like right there where they killed soon as they killed a buffalo.

772
00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.420
It's [inaudible].
It's done.
And you're dealing with,
with a buffalo,

773
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:05.280
you're dealing with a 2000 plus pound animal that's more than a thousand pounds

774
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:08.250
of just meat.
It's incredible.
I mean,

775
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.140
and buffalo is delicious.
Yeah.
The problem with buffalo is very little.

776
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:16.730
Buffalo is wild.
Most of it is like there's,

777
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:20.820
there's some buffalo ranches in California actually we can go and hunt in quotes

778
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:21.923
a buffalo,

779
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.130
but you're hunting in a high fence operation where they have like a couple

780
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:30.240
thousand acres and these animals live this permanently inside these fences and

781
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:32.730
you just go seek them out and shoot him.
I mean,

782
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.460
it's more wild than a farm for sure,

783
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:39.900
but it's not like really wild in some cheat and shit.

784
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.080
May and may were hunting buffalo wild buffalo in Mexico.

785
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.120
That's that.
Yeah.
Those are real buffalo.

786
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.480
Those are buffalo that were actually introduced in the 1950s they brought like

787
00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:56.481
30 buffalo down there and now they have a huge sustainable heard in Sonoma.

788
00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.200
It's sustainable.
Yeah.
I mean there's,
there's a lot of them.
There's,

789
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.590
there's a large population of buffalo and Mexico,

790
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.470
like the United States has tags.
Like you have limits.

791
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:10.020
They'd tell you how many of you can kill and when you can,

792
00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:11.570
and when the population is dropped,

793
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:14.940
they reduced the tags and then you have to enter into a draw.
You know,

794
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:17.400
that's how most it's done in most parts of the country.

795
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:21.360
Like there's places in the country where like elk especially very difficult to

796
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:24.960
get a tag and certain places you put in you might not get one for four or five

797
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:28.110
years.
So we are now,
they,

798
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.010
since the natural

799
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.280
<v 3>predators,
what would have been,
are no longer there.</v>

800
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:35.560
So we were taking their place.
Well,

801
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.650
there are definitely still natural predators almost everywhere where these,

802
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:41.650
these kind of large game animals,
there's mountain lions and wolves,

803
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.870
especially in Canada,
Canada,

804
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.470
they have so many wolves in Canada that where I was in DC,

805
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:49.840
they have no limit to the amount of wolves you can kill.

806
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.480
They want you to kill wolves.
We got coffee.
Oops.

807
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.380
Here at Hollywood they might like coyotes.

808
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.030
Jackals.
Hmm.

809
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.470
But the point being that I have a garden in my house,
um,
we have chickens,

810
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.850
my wife and I,
we have 24 chickens.
We get all our eggs from these chickens.

811
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.280
So we get fresh eggs.
You get blue and green eggs,

812
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.520
they're blue and green and Brown.
And they look different.
Man,

813
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:16.730
when you crack those eggs,

814
00:48:16.731 --> 00:48:21.070
it's hard to cut dark orange yolk because it'd be glowing and it's so healthy

815
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:26.020
for you because my chickens are wandering,
we feed them,
we feed them some tables,

816
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:30.040
graphs like vegetables and we will actually feed them like some fish or some

817
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:32.680
leftover before or game meat or something like that.

818
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.670
But they also wander around the yard.
So they're constantly eating grass.

819
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:41.170
They're kind of like,
when you see vegetarian raise chickens.
Right.
Guess what?

820
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.430
You're not supposed to be there.
Fucking omnivores chickens are dinosaurs.

821
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.320
That's what they are.
Yeah.
They're dinosaurs that survived.

822
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.640
I mean that's really is what they are.
And they eat everything.
They,

823
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.290
they wander around the yard and they eat.

824
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.790
Like my wife will like lift up rocks and they text slugs.

825
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:02.020
They go fucking crazy for worms and slugs and bugs.

826
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.330
It's kind of cool to watch them do it.

827
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.190
I used to have a friend and I used to take my,
um,

828
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.070
those grubs.
Yeah.

829
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.520
I used to take the grips from the compost and give them to their chicken.

830
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:18.160
They go crazy.
Right?
Yeah.
Mine are cool because they're like,

831
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.460
we have so much interaction with them that they're like my friends.

832
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.930
Like I go see them,
I go,

833
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:26.130
hello girls and I opened up the gate and let them out into the yard and they,

834
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.200
you know they run through your legs and stuff.
They're so used to us.

835
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.870
We could pick them up but yet they make food for us.
You have a rooster or to no.

836
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.060
Yeah.
Why do you say it like that?

837
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:40.350
Cause that mother fucker will wake up your neighbors man,
I don't want,

838
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.270
I opened the gate once at the pupil had this rooster man,

839
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.460
the chickens are in there and the rooster,
I didn't even,

840
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.920
he was like six feet in the air clause.
Done like fuck you up.
I'm like,

841
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:57.500
I'm cool.
Testosterone motherfucker.
Chickens.

842
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:00.540
Testosterone is a terrible,
which is a hell of a dreaded,

843
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.190
it's the reason why the buildings are so tall and offenses are so high and the

844
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:10.300
guns are so strong.
It's all testosterone.
If it was only women on the planet,

845
00:50:10.301 --> 00:50:13.450
they just be some fucking arguments.
A few hair pulling matches

846
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:19.330
or testosterone is what's up.
My friend Remi.
Um,
he,
uh,

847
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.830
he has chickens and his neighbor had a rooster that was coming over and fucking

848
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:28.580
his chickens and just going crazy.
And so he put a concrete,

849
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.480
<v 2>like there's the,</v>

850
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:33.410
that you apparently by these roosters that are like made out of cement.

851
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.430
They look like a rooster and he placed it in front of the chicken coop and this

852
00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:41.810
rooster came over and started fighting with the concrete rooster and just got

853
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:46.670
his ass kicked.
Just I fell down and kicked it and stop coming around.

854
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:51.530
We need
you.
Right?
He's like,
that rooster,

855
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.720
fuck me up.
And he would try,

856
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.890
he just came over and picked it and kicked it and just said,

857
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:00.200
fuck this and just literally stop coming around

858
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.060
<v 1>when you see what they do to these chickens though,
man.
It's terrible.
Yeah,</v>

859
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:09.200
it's pretty bad.
It's pretty,
it's pretty bad.
It's,
it's,
I didn't know that,

860
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:09.771
you know,

861
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:13.040
that they do these chickens like that and to see this chicken's feathers and

862
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:17.990
body raped up and scarred up.
It's like,
Damn Dude.
Is it that?
Yeah,

863
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:18.883
I'm cool on that.

864
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.750
<v 2>Yeah.
When you bought chickens that have been factory farm too,</v>

865
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.270
there's,
it's illegal in a lot of places to film the conditions,
right?

866
00:51:28.271 --> 00:51:33.271
Like they've made laws against exposing how inhumane it is to raise chickens

867
00:51:34.661 --> 00:51:39.070
like that,
which is what kind of a fucking law could you have that would,

868
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.300
that would prevent you from exposing something that most people think should be

869
00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:45.140
illegal?
Like QMAP engine that,

870
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.620
<v 1>no.
Well,
I mean,
we have,
I mean,
we,</v>

871
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.440
we need those chicken sandwiches at these fast food restaurants,
man.
You know,

872
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.530
it's crazy.
It's really cool,
neat and quick.
So,
I mean,

873
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:58.040
when you think of the numbers,
the,
uh,
you know,
I,

874
00:51:58.041 --> 00:52:03.041
I remember like the guy that runs the food at La Unified,

875
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:07.070
he was like,
he telling me,
Ron,
I've already served 300 and some thousand meals.

876
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:11.630
This breakfast is this morning,
you know,
and you think,
God damn,
you know,

877
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:16.310
I've had substance something thousand hundred thousand chickens,
lunches,

878
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:20.150
and you're like,
and that's just,
you think that's just a school?
You know?

879
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:24.740
What about everybody else?
Right?
So,
yeah.
So yeah,
it's,

880
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.830
I don't know how are we going to do that?
But I think it's a numbers issue,
right?

881
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.240
Yeah,
it is.
But you know,
we have this,
we can't feed everybody.

882
00:52:32.241 --> 00:52:35.510
We don't have enough food to feed.
Everybody know you guys waste.

883
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.540
They said it's up to 50% of the food now that's to produce.

884
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:42.530
They say it's 50% of the food is going back to waste,
man.
So I,

885
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:45.980
my whole thing is like I don't need you to feed me dude.
You know,

886
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:47.820
and I guess you are on the same tip.
It's like no,

887
00:52:47.821 --> 00:52:51.410
I got got my bow and Arrow and I got my ar and I'm cool.
You know,

888
00:52:51.411 --> 00:52:53.630
I feed my and I got my chickens.
Yeah,

889
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.930
<v 2>yeah.
If you could feed yourself,
it would be ideal.</v>

890
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.180
The problem is a lot of people that live in apartment,

891
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:01.910
they don't have a lot of them.
They don't have the land.
They have the space.

892
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.240
And that's where like your idea of using the medians and using empty lots like

893
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:13.070
God,
there's got to be enough room on every block and it should be mandated.

894
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.110
I mean if we have,
look,
if you look at La,
you look at the grid of La,
if,

895
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.560
if,
if it's set up the way it's set up and,
and doesn't,

896
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:25.980
it should be engineered to have these spaces in it.
And if it was engineered

897
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.110
<v 3>to have these spaces,
one on every block,</v>

898
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.200
it wouldn't look much different than the way it looks now.

899
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.890
But it would supply food to everybody that lives on those blocks.

900
00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.030
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean it,
it's,
it's perfect.</v>

901
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:42.220
I don't know why they said that's what I'm saying and that's why they have to

902
00:53:42.221 --> 00:53:42.970
know this.

903
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:43.630
<v 3>Do you think it,</v>

904
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:47.140
but who are they when you say they have to know this or you think that they're

905
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:50.230
taking advantage of the situation as it exists now?

906
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:51.910
Or do you think they actively engineered?

907
00:53:51.911 --> 00:53:55.140
Because this situation has been there for a long fucking time now.

908
00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.570
So people that are in power right now or they've essentially,

909
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.770
they've stepped into power after the,
the,
the,
it was already in place.

910
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:06.400
<v 1>Yeah.
But if everybody started growing in food,
think of this,</v>

911
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:10.710
the system that you attack and eliminate [inaudible] they,

912
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.180
they have these things called lobbyists and everything.
Man,

913
00:54:13.181 --> 00:54:16.210
they're going to be up in an uproar.
Man.
That's a real problem,
right?

914
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.280
<v 3>Yes.
Are fucking creepy.
They're creeper.
I really are.
I mean that,</v>

915
00:54:21.281 --> 00:54:24.940
that situation is very strange that someone came up with that shit though.

916
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:29.620
I don't know.
Demon spawn.
It's this fuck.

917
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.750
There's a lot of things,
special interest groups.

918
00:54:31.751 --> 00:54:36.751
The fact that the supreme court made it so corporations can donate money like an

919
00:54:37.121 --> 00:54:40.210
individual as much as they want,
which is just fucked.

920
00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:44.090
And then you have people that are paid to say that this should is healthy and

921
00:54:44.091 --> 00:54:47.080
yes,
and that's what's crazy.
And it's like,
how do you sleep?

922
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:50.020
<v 1>You know,
like the,
these companies that have,
I'm like,</v>

923
00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.680
do you guys eat this shit that you produce or have had?
Do you have,

924
00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:56.590
you drank the Koolaid and uh,

925
00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:01.780
<v 3>I don't fucking Doctor Oz was on TV talking about Miracle Diet pills or miracle</v>

926
00:55:01.781 --> 00:55:02.470
cures for.

927
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:07.130
<v 1>Yeah.
And Dr and Dr [inaudible] is my dog too,
man.
Yeah.
He my mind.</v>

928
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.910
He's cool.
You know what I mean?
It's cool peeps,

929
00:55:10.911 --> 00:55:14.060
but I don't know what the hell that was about.
I mean the same thing with

930
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:19.740
<v 3>exactly what I was about
talking to her.
I was just thinking about that.</v>

931
00:55:19.741 --> 00:55:22.110
Numerous has five 50

932
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.800
24th nobody drives a 24 potholes.
They destroy your wheels.

933
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:32.730
Everybody gave up on Rems,
right?
Remember what spinners?

934
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:34.620
Spinners was a tipping point.

935
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:38.580
It's like people had nice rims and then the spinners and everybody went,

936
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:44.740
yeah,
let's shut this shit down.
It's time to shut this shit down.

937
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:49.440
And then we had to bring a pack and now everybody has stock rims.
You know,

938
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:54.780
Doctor Oz is not interested in no 24 standard,
19 inch wheels are fine.

939
00:55:55.230 --> 00:56:00.030
He just wants to just drive around and just listen to music and nice Mercedes.

940
00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:02.670
Thinking about those diet pills,
making them all that money.

941
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.610
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
what's his name?
What was,</v>

942
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:09.240
what was Dr Phil had a problem some years back,
you know with what?

943
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:14.110
But the same kind of product kind of thing.
Endorsing that Shit.
Chris bitches,

944
00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:17.220
but we never get in trouble.
Oprah should be president,
man.

945
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:21.210
I'm telling you though.
Everybody wants a woman president.
Why Not Oprah?
No,

946
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.890
I think,
I think Michelle should be President

947
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:28.930
<v 3>Obama's yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Why is that?
Why do you think?
I don't know.
She just,</v>

948
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.100
she's sexy and she's just seemed like,
she just seemed like a beast man.

949
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:36.640
She just seemed like she,
she know what time it is.
I Dunno.
Well,

950
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:40.360
it wouldn't be a bad thing for a woman to be president because I think women are

951
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:43.870
much less,
wait,
wait,
whoa.
Back Up.
But the first person,

952
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:45.880
they ha they were trying to get in there.

953
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:50.600
Elizabeth Warren or Mission Hillary Clinton?
No.
The chick that can see,
can see,

954
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:55.390
you can see Russia from her front porch,
you know,
or some shit.

955
00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:59.230
That was just a ploy to get scared white people to vote for carrying her.

956
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.990
That's all that was.
That was like,
but they loved her.

957
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.260
They loved her concept of her,
but once it was exposed,
which she really is,

958
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.180
then they didn't like her.
That's why it didn't work.

959
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.160
They found out she's a fucking moron.

960
00:57:12.161 --> 00:57:14.630
When Katie Couric was interviewing her like,
oh my God,

961
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.830
what magazines do you read?
What newspapers do you read?

962
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.220
It's like a vicious and read.

963
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.610
She doesn't read shit so wrong emails.

964
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:30.010
It's true.
She's a fucking on that interview.
It was like,

965
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:35.870
you realize and they lampoon the shit outta her on Saturday night.
My Dad.

966
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.010
Yeah.
It was bad though.
While it was great.
I mean that's what made a,

967
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:39.461
what's her name?

968
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:44.110
What's the funny woman that did her on Saturday night live that made her famous?

969
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:47.460
That's what made her famous essentially.

970
00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:52.630
Well then then that Lisa Ann porn star dinner and those,
uh,

971
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:56.440
that made her famous to those porn videos when she played Sarah Palin.

972
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.680
Don't pretend you don't know.
No,
I look at him.
He slept buyer.
Who does this?

973
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:02.520
Porn porn.
No,
I'm not saying,
I'm not just saying,

974
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.950
I'm just saying that I haven't done in dove in porn every day,

975
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.320
but,
but no,
I'm at least saying no,
I don't see,
I'm not like you do it.

976
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:15.640
I don't get invited to the conferences and all that shit.
Yeah,
whatever.
I don't,

977
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.620
I don't go to anything.
This is what I,
I go to,
I go to a UFC fights and I shoot.

978
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:23.710
How many stores?
Daddy?
Oh,

979
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.820
Bambi.
Bambi and Yogi and blue.

980
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:32.200
Blue and gold.
That's right there.
I shot him right in the Dick.

981
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.670
I'm going to eat a bowl or burger later tonight.
Yeah,
no,

982
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:41.920
you got to put me up on that.
I mean,
I tasted good too.

983
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.390
I wish I brought him in for you.
You eat snake.
I have eaten snake.
Yeah,

984
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:49.840
it's weird.
It's very lean,
you know,
but it's very good for you.

985
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.970
You know what's really,
really good for is alligator.
I,

986
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.490
I've only had it like a restaurant where it was like frozen and thawed out and

987
00:58:57.491 --> 00:58:58.324
it wasn't that good.

988
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.260
But apparently according to the people that like actually hunt alligators,

989
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:07.010
they do the protein analysis on the meat.
It's like twice as much protein,
beef.

990
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.100
I mean,
it's something you can get it in.
Um,

991
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.160
you can get it in Louisiana where they have so many alligators now.

992
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.570
Those stupid alligator shows those swamp people and it's fucking redneck

993
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:19.180
hillbillies wandering around shooting these alligators.

994
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:22.070
They shoot 500 of them a season.
They're allowed to shoot

995
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.880
<v 2>500 alligators a season.
That's how many there are.
I mean,
they're infested.</v>

996
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:30.040
<v 1>So what does the season though is that I know here is that it's usually a come</v>

997
00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:34.390
on,
you said a couple of months?
Well,
it depends on the animal.
I've head gate,

998
00:59:34.391 --> 00:59:37.880
I've had a,
I think I've had a gate or,
um,
uh,

999
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:42.910
was it poor boy or something real?
Yeah.
Wow.
No,
I mean Louisiana,

1000
00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.850
I'd be big as a house if I lived there.

1001
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.520
The food deep fried the fuck out of everything.
I'm just saying the food is,

1002
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.700
it's flavor dude.
You can't find that flavor nowhere else.

1003
00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:55.690
And that shit is just like,
oh my God.
Yeah.
I don't,
I don't,

1004
00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.010
I go and it's like,
Damn Dude,
you know,
I try not to eat like two weeks before.

1005
01:00:00.011 --> 01:00:04.390
I know I'm going to Louisiana because I know I'm just going to fuck
you.

1006
01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:08.800
Like spicy food.
I love that show,
man.

1007
01:00:08.801 --> 01:00:12.630
Come on man.
Good Cajun restaurant in La.
Uh,

1008
01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:18.760
not like Louisiana.
I haven't found nothing.
That's,
that's like Louisiana,

1009
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.710
that Real Gumbo.
I mean,
even when you go to house of Blues and in Louisiana,

1010
01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.210
it's a whole nother game.
And I,

1011
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.890
and I remember seeing Dan Aykroyd once here and at the House of Blues in

1012
01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:32.350
Hollywood,
you know,
and I just,
I mean,

1013
01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:37.120
I was in Louisiana and I think Ada House of Blues Shit three times,
you know,

1014
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:41.500
so I'm like,
damn,
that's good.
The food was the bomb.
And I'm,
I told,
you know,

1015
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.200
accurate say man,
this,
this food man,

1016
01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:47.840
y'all need the same food that he didn't take it too good.
I said,
y'all need to,

1017
01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.060
y'all need the same food that they got it and knew that you're the chef you got

1018
01:00:52.061 --> 01:00:53.080
in Louisiana,
man.

1019
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.350
He say he didn't take it to grin on his face,
kind of a change.

1020
01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:03.180
So look man,
you know,
I thought it was putting them up on,

1021
01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.750
I thought I was putting them up on game.

1022
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.910
<v 2>He's a squirrely dude.
Yeah.
You ever hear them talking about Ufo shows?
No.
Oh,</v>

1023
01:01:08.911 --> 01:01:13.620
he's hilarious.
He's fucking believes every damn story of Ufo was ever he.
Yeah.

1024
01:01:13.621 --> 01:01:15.450
He does all these UFO documentaries.

1025
01:01:15.451 --> 01:01:19.380
He's always the narrator for these UFO things.
Apparently he's just on Ufo nut.

1026
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.010
Okay,
so what do you think about chem trails?
What do I think about chem trails?

1027
01:01:23.011 --> 01:01:25.890
Yes.
This is the reason,
and this I did a special on a shot,

1028
01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.320
an episode of this for the Scifi show.
The I did.

1029
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:32.730
When you see those clouds across the sky,
when a jet is going across the sky,

1030
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.940
that is absolutely 100% a jet engine reacting to the condensation in the

1031
01:01:39.211 --> 01:01:43.980
atmosphere.
When a jet engine is driving or flying through condensation,

1032
01:01:43.981 --> 01:01:46.680
the way it spins and the heat temperature,

1033
01:01:46.681 --> 01:01:51.681
the changing of the temperature of the air causes artificial clouds and this is

1034
01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:56.250
scientifically documented.
No one in the scientific world disagrees with it.

1035
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.293
However,

1036
01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.080
when you talk about has the government sprayed things from the sky 100% they

1037
01:02:03.871 --> 01:02:06.630
definitely have.
Not only have they done it,
it's documented.

1038
01:02:06.631 --> 01:02:10.440
These tests have been documented.
They did one in,
was it Detroit?

1039
01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:15.030
I think it was Detroit where they,
they wanted to test during the Cold War.

1040
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.290
What would happen if the United States got a face sprayed?

1041
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.880
Some sort of a biological age and like a biological weapon.
So they sprayed this,

1042
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.740
these particles into the sky.
Which Detroit?
Yeah.
When we,

1043
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.090
who we don't need Detroit.
Let's just test these.

1044
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.720
They said that these were innocuous particles and they wanted to measure them

1045
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:38.400
and they definitely for sure have experimented with cloud seeding.

1046
01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:42.450
They know how to start rain and rain.
That's what happened in Vietnam.

1047
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:45.000
Oh yeah.
They did a lot of shit in Vietnam.

1048
01:02:45.001 --> 01:02:47.620
They did a lot of experimenting in Vietnam.
Well,

1049
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:50.850
it's one of the things they do whenever they go to war.
Whenever they go to war,

1050
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:51.530
they bust out.

1051
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:55.350
Also look at the fucking depleted uranium shells they denied using and the

1052
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:59.730
original Iraq war that caused all these veterans to get sick as fuck.

1053
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.740
All that Gulf War syndrome.

1054
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:07.190
Most scientists believe that it's directly from depleted uranium for sure.

1055
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:11.070
They used and they denied it for the longest fucking time,

1056
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.170
but they use these depleted uranium shells.

1057
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.200
Apparently they just blow through everything tanks and armored w weapon

1058
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:23.790
carriers.
They just boom,
depleted uranium is so insanely dense.

1059
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.570
It just goes through everything and that's it's fucking nuclear waste,
you know.

1060
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.210
So they're creating these weapons out of nuclear waste.

1061
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:33.150
The shit has a half life of like a 100,000 years.

1062
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:37.440
So these soldiers are around these burnt out husks of these,
uh,

1063
01:03:37.441 --> 01:03:41.130
these tanks that they shot with the shit that breathing it in and they all get

1064
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.670
deathly deathly ill and that,
that's a fact.

1065
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:48.090
And that's something where they get away with experimenting with things like,

1066
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.940
look,
we're already killing a million fucking people.

1067
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.640
Let's experiment with some shit.
So that's what they do.

1068
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.100
And then that shit still in the air though.
Yes.

1069
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.820
But as far as like what people think chem trails or like you see those clouds

1070
01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:03.900
across the sky and every like,
oh,
the government spraying us.
No,

1071
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.230
that is not what happens.
And when you say that it,
it,

1072
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.850
the real problem is it throws everything else into question because it's so

1073
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.990
easily disproved.

1074
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.960
It makes it look like people are being kooks and then it makes it,

1075
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.710
it makes everybody like,
like,
oh,
the fucking sky is falling.
I,
no,
no.

1076
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:22.920
It's a fucking artificial cloud created by a jet engine.
It's that simple.

1077
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.690
Ready in grids though,
because flight patterns are in grids.
It's real simple.

1078
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:32.810
When you see planes flying from Burbank to Phoenix or you're going the same

1079
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:35.520
route every time and they crisscross each other.

1080
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.170
Everybody's looking for some crazy grand conspiracy when it comes to these chem

1081
01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:40.890
trails,

1082
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:45.890
but it is 100% jet engines interacting with condensation.

1083
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:47.430
We talk to scientists,

1084
01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.400
we talked to people that believe in people that don't believe,

1085
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:54.300
people that believe in conspiracies and believe in chem trails at their fucking

1086
01:04:54.301 --> 01:04:55.860
loony there.
Lily,
any man,

1087
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:58.940
they didn't do the work and when you talk to them about w the,

1088
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.960
the actual fact like you show them like a real jet engine that is interacting

1089
01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.410
with the condensation,
the atmosphere and creating these artificial clouds.

1090
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.470
All of a sudden they don't want to believe that those are the government made

1091
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:14.490
that video.
Not another fucking southwest,
not it to fucking flight.

1092
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:17.620
It's a flight flying out of Burbank.
They're not spraying Matt.

1093
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:19.930
Oh the aluminum and Barium.
We did this.

1094
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.720
We have this interview with this guy who was talking about aluminum and Barium

1095
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:25.690
in the soil,
and that's the aluminum embarrassments proven.

1096
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:30.140
We did sample tests of this water and it had aluminum and Barium in it.
But I,

1097
01:05:30.141 --> 01:05:33.040
I talked to the guy said,
well,
it says sludge here in this,

1098
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:37.870
in this exam says sludge.
I go,
what a sludge mean.
And he goes,
well,
I don't know.

1099
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:40.060
You tell me what it means.
I go,
okay,
let's Google it.

1100
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:44.440
So I googled sludges water mixed with dirt.
I go,
see you have dirt and water.

1101
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:48.940
I go,
do you know that dirt is like,
has a big percentage of dirt,

1102
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:52.990
is fucking aluminum.
Like aluminum is in dirt everywhere.
It's a natural,

1103
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:56.920
it's a natural metal.
It's all over the fucking world.
There's aluminum.

1104
01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:58.420
It's like one of the most common metals.

1105
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.110
So what you're saying is your dirt tested positive for being dirt.

1106
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.040
And that's not evidence of a fucking conspiracy.
Not only that,

1107
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.310
you know how ridiculous it would be to try over.

1108
01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.480
They're trying to control the population.

1109
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.140
They're fucking controlling themselves to their spraying entire cities.

1110
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:16.840
You'll stupid.
That is the idea that they're spraying cities.

1111
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:21.200
<v 1>Great.
And,
but my whole thing is when we look at the food,</v>

1112
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:24.920
what's the difference?
What are these people?
What is making this bullshit food?

1113
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.680
What are they eating?
Joe,
here's a real chem trail.

1114
01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.920
You want him a real chem trails that burning gasoline in the sky.

1115
01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.360
That's the real chem trail.

1116
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:34.660
<v 2>The real chem trails.
The thing that people aren't even worried about,</v>

1117
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.350
the thing that everyone knows,
everyone knows you get into a jet,

1118
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:39.310
you fly to New York,

1119
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:44.670
that fucking Chet is burning in the sky 30,000 feet above your head.

1120
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.890
That's not innocuous,
right?
That shit is bad for you.
Or people around airplanes,

1121
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:55.540
airports,
there's a high level of the asthma,
lung disorders,
diseases,

1122
01:06:55.690 --> 01:07:00.220
they're breathing in burning fumes.
That's real as fuck.

1123
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:01.290
<v 1>Well,
I mean it's like this,</v>

1124
01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.040
that apartment that burned down next to the freeway and downtown.

1125
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.850
So it was so funny that it would happen because a friend was talking,

1126
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.190
you know how they have,
if you lived here,
you'd be home.

1127
01:07:11.191 --> 01:07:14.100
Now you know how they have those banners and,
and she was like,

1128
01:07:14.101 --> 01:07:17.340
what about if there was a banner we put on the building and said,

1129
01:07:17.341 --> 01:07:21.570
if you lived here,
you'd have cancer,
asthma,
you know,

1130
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.950
and all kinds of shit is know what they already know that you don't do not build

1131
01:07:25.951 --> 01:07:28.260
buildings that close to it.
The fucking freeway.

1132
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:33.240
And you've got these people's balcony literally 50 feet away from the freeway.

1133
01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:34.650
I don't know.
It's crazy.

1134
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.950
<v 2>By the way,
is not just a fumes.
It's fucking break dust.
Yeah.</v>

1135
01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.160
People don't think about that brake dust when you will.
You clean your wheels.

1136
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.040
If you take your car to a car wash and he tried to clean your wheels,

1137
01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:50.630
all that shit that,
that black powder,
that fucking shits in the air,
man,

1138
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.260
that shit's in the air and it gets in your lungs.
And people that live in cities,

1139
01:07:54.261 --> 01:07:58.340
like in New York City,
they're sucking in brake dust all day long,

1140
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.230
all day long.
You know,
if we really cared about people,
we would,
first of all,

1141
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.890
we would change it.
We would make a carbon ceramic breaks.

1142
01:08:06.891 --> 01:08:09.780
It'd be mandatory because it limits the amount of brake dust.

1143
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.500
They're more expensive,
but you can get them on performance cars,

1144
01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.220
but it limits the amount of brake dust drastically.
Like if you have carbon

1145
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:18.860
<v 3>ceramic breaks in your car,
you don't get brake dust or anywhere else.</v>

1146
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.380
It's different.
And they could choose,

1147
01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.860
they could come up with some sort of a material that's not so fucking toxic.

1148
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.690
That's shit that you're breathing in.

1149
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:32.050
You're breathing in a combination of the chemicals that are being burned in the

1150
01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:36.830
androgens gas,
the pollutants.
It was a lot of shit.
The,

1151
01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.050
and they,
what kills me is they,

1152
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:43.040
they've done these tests and they said it should be at least 200 yard,

1153
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:47.180
some crazy 200 yards away.
That's almost a safe zone.

1154
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.130
And it keep building these living,

1155
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.670
these buildings where people live in right next to these freeways.

1156
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:57.560
Even school's right next to freeways like that.
And it's like,
no,
it's no concern.

1157
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:58.423
You know,

1158
01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:02.510
it's just convenient and people are willing to live there and they just bury

1159
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:06.980
their head in the ground like an ostrich,
you know?
Yeah.
There's a lot of that.

1160
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:12.050
Well,
the reality is what we've constructed as far as like modern urban cities,

1161
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:16.170
they're not natural or not natural,
and they're not well thought out in,

1162
01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:19.550
in that it's not healthy for your body.
Nope.
It's not an optimal,

1163
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.330
they say that people that live in cities that will die an average of 10 years

1164
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.110
earlier because of the fact that you're taking in these pollutants and toxins

1165
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.330
and someone who lives in the country that falls exact same sort of diet in

1166
01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:31.400
lifestyle.
Wow.

1167
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:35.150
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
I mean that's,
we in,</v>

1168
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:40.460
instead of making homes for us to live in,
you know,
that,
uh,

1169
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:43.940
that,
uh,
accommodate us.
I think it's like you said,
it's just the opposite.

1170
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:46.160
These houses are not made for us.

1171
01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:48.620
They're made for this space that when they're not,
I mean,

1172
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:51.300
even when you think of the,
um,
you,

1173
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:55.100
if you take the sun and the moon into account when you're building,

1174
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.770
which was a lot of these things,
oh,
this is the property I'm building.

1175
01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:59.500
What's fits in here?
They don't take a lot of the,

1176
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:04.190
the natural resources resources in,
into account when they're,
when they're,

1177
01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:05.930
when they're doing these construction projects.

1178
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:09.460
<v 3>Yeah.
Without a doubt.
And then they're not worried about the effect of,</v>

1179
01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.400
it's going to have on these people that live right next to the city or right

1180
01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:14.500
next to the freeway.
Rather,
they just know,
look,

1181
01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.880
we have this lot and we can make x amount of money if we put a hundred apartment

1182
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:23.320
buildings in this lot,
fuck it,
let's build.
And they just build.
It's dark,

1183
01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:28.020
<v 1>man.
It's just,
it really is this weird.
It was weird.
The people are willing to,</v>

1184
01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:30.390
we got to find some light,
man,
you know,
this and that.

1185
01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:34.230
And that's kind of why I started,
you know,
what I'm doing.
I mean there's,

1186
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:34.891
this is one thing,

1187
01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:38.340
but what you're doing with growing plants is you're actually filtering the air.

1188
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:41.370
No doubt.
That's one of the reasons,
well,
when,

1189
01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:45.710
you know what I love about the fight,
you're filtering the air.
Um,

1190
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.780
and the conversations that I have that I would never have had if this garden

1191
01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:56.040
wasn't there.
I mean,
people that I have,
you know,
homeless guys is man,

1192
01:10:56.041 --> 01:11:00.720
I love walking by here.
I walked by here every day and it makes me feel good,

1193
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:04.880
you know,
and,
and,
or the interaction with these kids that are,

1194
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.730
have a guy that comes by every day to point him,
his kids in a wagon,

1195
01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:12.390
he points out everything and tells her what it is in Spanish,
you know,

1196
01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:17.160
so I a busload of kids from Harvard,
you know,
come wow.
And it's like,

1197
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.690
and to me it's like,
wow,
really this is,
but one thing is like you said,

1198
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.730
you're changing the ecosystem.

1199
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.780
I get up every morning and I get to see hummingbirds,
I get to see butterflies.

1200
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.800
I get to see the beads that took over a Trashcan,
you know,
for two and a half,

1201
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.970
three years now,
you know,
I gave him a new condo recently,
you know,

1202
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:37.650
with a window in the back.

1203
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:42.360
But do you raise bees or they just lived the day they came.

1204
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:46.950
And now I mean,
I'm kind of forced to deal with them.
Um,
yeah,

1205
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.560
but I'm,

1206
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.570
I'm cool with them because what's beautiful is all they have to do is fly 25,

1207
01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:54.330
30 feet to get,
you know,
and they're back to their hive.

1208
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.470
So they get the sunflowers that I have planted on the front and um,

1209
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:01.890
they're doing their pollination thing.
So it,
it's a win win.
I mean,

1210
01:12:01.891 --> 01:12:04.530
and that's the thing is that that whole,
if you build it,
they will come.

1211
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:07.530
So I have pollinators,
I get to see butterflies,
I get to see,

1212
01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:12.180
but also get these damn baby bears that they call raccoons.

1213
01:12:12.181 --> 01:12:15.780
And you know,
they're crazy.
I think.
Stop Dude,
this scary.
No,

1214
01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:19.530
it says hell and they don't,
they don't run.
No.
You know,
they don't run.

1215
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:21.570
And it's like you ripping up my garden,
dude.

1216
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.930
And you just turn around and look at me and say,
you see these claws dude,

1217
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:28.260
I will fuck you up.
Yeah.
They don't give a fuck about people know man,

1218
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:33.000
those urban Ratko knowing their big dude,
they're kind of the kind of scary,

1219
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.640
well they know how to open up trash cans.
Yeah.
First of all.

1220
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:37.110
And they're getting a lot of food.
Yeah,

1221
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:42.111
I heard that's all special one on PBS or something where in Japan they had

1222
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.360
people had them cause there was this little cartoon and they were all,

1223
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:46.710
oh so all the kids,

1224
01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:51.270
all of a sudden everybody had raccoons until they grew bigger and they start

1225
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:53.130
tearing up the house and then what they did,

1226
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:57.480
they just put them out of the house and now they're ruining like all this

1227
01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:01.800
ancient this way you architecture in um,

1228
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.660
in Japan.
I mean just tearing shit up.
Yeah.
Raccoons.
Are there.

1229
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:09.330
Interesting animals.
Cause they kind of have like little hands,

1230
01:13:09.331 --> 01:13:13.230
like a person because that's how they opened to get the trashcan in broad

1231
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:16.800
daylight,
man.
They'll just turn over trash cans and,
but I have raccoons.

1232
01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:21.120
And then I mean one day,
literally I'm going,
I'm leaving going,
I was like nine,

1233
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:24.600
10 o'clock.
And I walked out and I see this possum,
you know,
on one side.

1234
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:28.500
And I'm like,
Damn.
And they see this possums are scary as hell to me.

1235
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.480
That just dead.
They just,
and then he disappears.

1236
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:36.480
And then I hear of shirt rustle in the tree and then there's this raccoon,

1237
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:40.200
it's underground.
It's like trying to go into my flower beds.
I'm like,

1238
01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:41.550
what the hell is this?
What it was?

1239
01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:46.350
Is this Alison Wonderland with the cook just menagerie and shit.
You know,

1240
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.420
I'm cool man.
But I can't,
I mean I,
I,

1241
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.160
I love the interaction,
you know,

1242
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:58.680
I love the people who,
the conversations I love,
you know,

1243
01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:02.580
cause I keep plants growing and I give people like if they like something,

1244
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.330
I'm like,
here,
I keep seeing Linds man here grow your own.

1245
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:07.890
You went to something like,
like my sunflowers here,
take it,
throw you off.

1246
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:12.040
Would you ever want to live in a place that's like more,
um,
more of like

1247
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.750
<v 3>a outdoor environment,
like you know,
more of a rural environment.</v>

1248
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:21.010
What do you like the fact that all this is happening in there

1249
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:24.450
<v 1>in the city?
Um,
yes and no.
I mean,</v>

1250
01:14:24.451 --> 01:14:26.880
and I think that's why a lot of people have,
you know,

1251
01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:30.900
they have the stuff and in parts of the valley in Malibu and places like that

1252
01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:35.200
where you can kind of have that kind of thing.
I mean,
uh,

1253
01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.650
where they have these big ass properties where you,

1254
01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:42.140
you do that and you have to come down the hill,
you know,
to um,

1255
01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:46.380
to go to the property,
um,
grocery store or something.
Yeah,
exactly.
I don't know.

1256
01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:51.030
I mean I like,
I like the city,
you know,
but also,
I mean I used to camp and stuff,

1257
01:14:51.031 --> 01:14:52.830
so I mean I appreciate that.

1258
01:14:52.831 --> 01:14:56.490
I appreciate the fact like you brought me back when you talked about the water

1259
01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:57.360
because you know,

1260
01:14:57.361 --> 01:15:02.310
the whole thing we learned is the snow runs down and then it hits all those

1261
01:15:02.311 --> 01:15:03.620
rocks and all that rockets.

1262
01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:07.260
The rocks are filtering the water and that water's just crystal fresh.

1263
01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:10.470
And it's clear because it's been filtered and filtered and filtered and filtered

1264
01:15:10.471 --> 01:15:12.000
by nature.
You know,

1265
01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:16.650
my whole thing is all this waste and all this fucked up shit is because of us.

1266
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:20.490
We all are.
Waste is US mother nature don't waste nothing.
We do.

1267
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.640
<v 3>And what's really crazy is human beings.</v>

1268
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.150
If we had been around in this form for whatever,
a hundred thousand years,

1269
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:29.240
the world's been around for four or something billion years,

1270
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:32.900
but we've only been fucking it up for like a hundred right?

1271
01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:38.200
That's kind of crazy.
I mean,
since the industrial era,
so what,
150 years,

1272
01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:42.240
whatever it is,
that's nuts.
And in that time we fucked dad.

1273
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.820
We've talked to like Japanese people that uh,

1274
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:51.590
are in the Sushi and like,
oh my God.
And that that used to,

1275
01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:56.000
they used to be able to pull like just so many tuna out of the ocean and now

1276
01:15:56.001 --> 01:16:00.720
it's hard.
It's not the same anymore.
The numbers of depleted drastically.
I mean,

1277
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:01.740
in our lifetime,

1278
01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:05.780
<v 1>these whales that are,
are,
are being beached.
And then people wonder why they,</v>

1279
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:07.320
they see the open,

1280
01:16:07.321 --> 01:16:10.290
they open these wells and it's like tons of plastic inside of them.

1281
01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:15.080
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
There's that kind of a lot of birds that accidentally feed there.</v>

1282
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:19.390
They're young chicks,
they feed them plastic.
They don't know what a plastic is.

1283
01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:22.240
They think it might be a fish or something and they're trying to feed it to

1284
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:23.110
their chicks and they,

1285
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.520
they find these dead chicks on some of these islands draws Dominique's filled

1286
01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:32.170
with plastic and these mat,
these a cigarette lighters didn't never ever,

1287
01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:34.680
ever deteriorate.
No nothing.
It was

1288
01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.130
<v 1>like we,
I mean and,
and it's like I asked some,</v>

1289
01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:41.760
it's like the same thing with something as simple as leaves.
We throw,

1290
01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:45.000
it's a nuisance stuff.
We throw it away.
They,
we don't see that has,

1291
01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.210
has a resource.
Those are,
that's soil dude.

1292
01:16:48.211 --> 01:16:52.920
That's rich as soil.
If he brought it,
and I tell people,
I said,
who gardens?

1293
01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.550
Who Gardens in in the forest?
No damn body.

1294
01:16:56.551 --> 01:17:00.810
So how the hell did we have 350 50 foot trees,
Mother Nature Blade,

1295
01:17:00.811 --> 01:17:04.680
the game plan down.
And we just keep trying to change the,
no,
go back to nature.

1296
01:17:04.681 --> 01:17:08.670
Go back to the real shit long.
Why don't we,
why don't we emulate,

1297
01:17:08.671 --> 01:17:11.480
why don't copy what she's doing?

1298
01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:15.580
<v 2>Have you ever gone to the rain forest and the Pacific northwest?
No.</v>

1299
01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:19.870
It's amazing up there because the ground is really,
really soft.

1300
01:17:19.871 --> 01:17:20.860
Like when you step on it,

1301
01:17:20.861 --> 01:17:24.700
it's like smooshes under your feet because it's literally six,

1302
01:17:24.701 --> 01:17:29.350
seven feet of leaders that have just dropped down there and that the lower you

1303
01:17:29.351 --> 01:17:33.280
go,
the it becomes dirt.
And as it decomposes,

1304
01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:36.340
like the lower you get,
it's feeding the soil.

1305
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.273
<v 1>It's Kinda,</v>

1306
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:41.670
it's kinda making this own concourse is making his own soil and nutrients
though.

1307
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.910
I mean then when you think of that whole process,

1308
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:48.350
it's like a circle when you think,
okay,
this the,
the,
the tree knows it's,

1309
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:49.221
it's winter.

1310
01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:53.540
So it's going to shed its leaves and those leaves create a mode for the tree.

1311
01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:54.530
So when it rains,

1312
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:59.130
the water stays there and then those leads turn into soil.
I mean,

1313
01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:02.960
it's that simple,
but it's also one of the most complex things on the planet.

1314
01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:07.640
<v 2>Take table scraps and like eggshells and all these different things.</v>

1315
01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.310
We throw them away and they just go into a garbage somewhere.

1316
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:14.720
But if we took those and put them in a compost pile and then added leaves and

1317
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:17.420
all that stuff,
it's incredible nutrition for those plants.

1318
01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:19.140
<v 1>Well,
my whole thing is I tell people,</v>

1319
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:24.620
to me it's compost made me realize that nothing ever dies ever.

1320
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.910
Okay.
Because if this leaf that you hear this crunchy sound,
cause it's dried out,

1321
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:33.840
that crunches energy,
but you put it with a Greenlee and all of a sudden,

1322
01:18:33.841 --> 01:18:37.260
so how does this shit heat up to 150 degrees?
If it was dead,
wait,

1323
01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:41.220
where did this heat come from?
If this is dead?
That's the weird thing,
right?

1324
01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.290
That he,
when you,
when you take a picture

1325
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.700
<v 2>fork and do a big compost pile,
you lift it up.
You see steam.</v>

1326
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:52.110
<v 1>No,
I,
I just recently I had some meat and I had my,</v>

1327
01:18:52.111 --> 01:18:53.760
I have some compost,
um,

1328
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:58.790
bands that I just had made and I put some meat in the middle of the compost Bin

1329
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.230
and this Shit Cook,
Dude.
I mean,
I,
I,
when I flipped it over,
this stuff was like,

1330
01:19:04.231 --> 01:19:07.560
you hit,
put it in a dam,
you know,
skillet or something.

1331
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:11.970
That's how I DePaul's could,
and it was crazy.
It is.
While they mean this heat,

1332
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.090
I mean,
and I think that's what it took me too.
It's like damn,

1333
01:19:15.091 --> 01:19:18.570
I wonder if the survivalist in the F that get in the forest,

1334
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:22.980
I wonder if this is a technique they use to keep the keep warm,
you know,

1335
01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.280
is to do a leaf pile or some shit like that.
Cause I mean,

1336
01:19:26.281 --> 01:19:30.000
you think of the heat that comes off of a compost pile.
Um,
will Allen,

1337
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:32.370
who has growing power and what he does,

1338
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:35.190
he heats his greenhouses with compost.

1339
01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:37.380
He builds the compost on the side of these.

1340
01:19:37.381 --> 01:19:41.670
He has these giant hoophouses and that's how he heats him is with compost.

1341
01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.690
And where does she say these greenhouses up?
Although he has,
um,
in,
um,

1342
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.530
he's in the Midwest and um,
she,
she's looking at my willpower.
He's,
um,

1343
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:54.570
he's a bad ass.
Um,
he's,
um,
got kids training them how to grow food sheet.

1344
01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:59.720
He has like this closed loop system where he does the fish,

1345
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:04.150
the fish and that fish,
the water from the fish goes into his double,

1346
01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:07.800
double tiered.
Um,
greenhouses are plants.

1347
01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:11.900
And so they watered the plants and then you eat the fish and he sells Easter

1348
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:12.743
fest.
So He's,

1349
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:15.060
<v 2>yeah,
my friend Jason just started doing that in his basement.</v>

1350
01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:18.660
He said it's incredible.
Like he spent months setting it up,
but the,

1351
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.010
the water and the poop from the fish oil's down.
Yeah.

1352
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:27.910
It filters down into the soil,
grows the plants from it and it's amazing.

1353
01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:32.250
Then he eats the plants.
Exactly.
And these systems,
these closed systems,
I mean,

1354
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:36.080
you can have one of those in your fucking basement and provide yourself with a

1355
01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.510
lot of food.
Hydroponically.

1356
01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.910
<v 1>A lot of,
a lot of this,
a lot of stuff has grown.</v>

1357
01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.650
A hydroponic aquaponics and hydroponics.
Yes.
Um,
and I mean,

1358
01:20:45.651 --> 01:20:47.060
I think that's the way,
I don't know.

1359
01:20:47.061 --> 01:20:52.061
I haven't been convinced on the flavor come compared to soil yet on the high on,

1360
01:20:53.841 --> 01:20:58.310
have you tried it?
Yeah,
I mean,
but now I want to do a serious,
like get down.
Okay.

1361
01:20:58.311 --> 01:21:02.450
I got four different six different vegetables from the ground or six different

1362
01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:05.210
vegetables.
The same thing from hydroponic.

1363
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.360
I mean a couple lives I have done cause I had one of those towers to,

1364
01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:13.610
someone gave me and I wasn't really convinced that the flavor,

1365
01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:17.550
I think that something about that soil,
do you know the best way to do it?

1366
01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.930
You know?
I mean I ain't saying it's the best but yeah.
Hell yes.

1367
01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.340
But at least with the aqua

1368
01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:28.130
<v 2>panic is edible and his solution.
It's a solution.</v>

1369
01:21:28.131 --> 01:21:32.790
It's a way to do it and it's better for sure than relying on supermarkets.

1370
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:35.100
Totally.
The more you can be self reliant,
you know,

1371
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:39.380
<v 1>but and that's where the day and that's where the defiance comes in and that's</v>

1372
01:21:39.381 --> 01:21:43.370
where that's,
that's where,
that's what a gangster come into me,
you know?

1373
01:21:43.371 --> 01:21:46.340
That's why I changed that.
That's why it was why you use gangster.

1374
01:21:46.341 --> 01:21:50.090
I said because growing your own food is gangster.
How's it?
How's IT Gangsta?

1375
01:21:50.091 --> 01:21:53.600
Because you're,
you're being self reliant,
you're taking care of yourself,

1376
01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:57.290
you're being a fucking bad.
Are you stepping away from the system anytime?
To me,

1377
01:21:57.291 --> 01:22:00.590
you step away from the system,
that Shit's gangster.
You know what I'm saying?

1378
01:22:00.591 --> 01:22:02.380
And in my whole thing is,
you know,

1379
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:07.130
we got these old Hollywood rappers and shit does doing this thing where you
know,

1380
01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:07.311
they're,

1381
01:22:07.311 --> 01:22:10.760
they're rapping about all this violence and all the shit they do and they live

1382
01:22:10.761 --> 01:22:14.330
in behind gates in Calabasas someday,
you know,
and they still,

1383
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:18.050
they still selling this bullshit on the streets.
So what did we have?

1384
01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:21.860
We have these kids emulating that shit that he made it look with and they,

1385
01:22:21.861 --> 01:22:22.221
you know,

1386
01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:26.510
so my thing was to give these kids something else to know the soil was gangster

1387
01:22:26.511 --> 01:22:30.260
dude,
you know,
let this,
let this shovel be your weapon,
you know,

1388
01:22:30.261 --> 01:22:34.610
not some gun I not singing about gang banging and Crippen and yo acids driving

1389
01:22:34.611 --> 01:22:38.580
around in a Bentley stop and not,
and they'll have no connection,
you know,

1390
01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:42.650
to that.
So my whole thing,
stop it,
stop,
stop pimping these kids like that,

1391
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:43.101
<v 2>that,</v>

1392
01:22:43.101 --> 01:22:46.620
that is the term to pimping these kids because they're capitalizing on this.

1393
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:51.890
There's this need to make something out of a terrible situation with that.

1394
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.590
So they,
they take pride in that terrible situation.

1395
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.110
Take pride and the violence and the gang bang,
the crime,

1396
01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:01.920
all that bullshit that really if they've escaped from it,

1397
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:04.770
they should be trying to figure out a way to help people escape from it.

1398
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.100
But instead of doing that,

1399
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.610
<v 1>they're pimping them.
Exactly.
In a lot of them,
I mean some of them have done it,</v>

1400
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:12.220
but a lot of them,
a lot of them haven't done it right.
You know,
and then,

1401
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:13.830
and they singing about it.
So my whole thing,

1402
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.000
I wanted to give these kids something else to look at,
man,

1403
01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:21.001
someone else till two to possibly grow into something else that where they can

1404
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:25.180
design their own life rather than this life that's been designed for them

1405
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:26.011
<v 2>now.</v>

1406
01:23:26.011 --> 01:23:30.720
What was it like when you did that Ted special and the one that I got ahold of

1407
01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:33.480
and I was like,
all right mom,
families on this,

1408
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:38.510
because I had been talking about the idea of that for a while and I had never

1409
01:23:40.471 --> 01:23:44.280
seen anybody that was like really promoting it until you,

1410
01:23:44.281 --> 01:23:47.760
which is kind of crazy if you really think about the fact that people have been

1411
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:48.930
growing things since people.

1412
01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:54.140
<v 1>Why?
That's how you,
that's how you colonize places.
That's how you,
hey shit,</v>

1413
01:23:54.141 --> 01:23:56.870
this soil's good.
Let's put the,
let's pitch the tent right here.

1414
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:58.790
That's how people set up shit.

1415
01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:02.290
<v 2>But for some reason,
until you came along and did a ted talk,</v>

1416
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.230
there weren't a lot of people that were doing this in an urban way,

1417
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:08.080
especially not people that were being publicized.

1418
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:11.930
<v 1>I think,
yeah,
I think that's what it was.
I mean that's,
it was,</v>

1419
01:24:11.970 --> 01:24:16.280
they were out there and me,
I'm a fashion design to dude.
I wasn't,
you know,

1420
01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:19.940
I wasn't,
is that what you do?
You make cloud was supposed to,

1421
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:23.750
that's what I did and to shit what,
oh eight when this recession,

1422
01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.070
this depression that they keep telling us it's a recession happen,
you know,

1423
01:24:28.071 --> 01:24:31.130
and it just,
it just hit it put me in a choke hold dude.
You know,

1424
01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:34.100
phone stopped ringing and people like we'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a

1425
01:24:34.101 --> 01:24:38.270
hamburger today and shit.
You know,
so it just,
it just fucked me up,
you know.

1426
01:24:38.271 --> 01:24:43.160
So this,
I,
I had other stuff that I did,
you know,
did some personal training.

1427
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.300
I did this just to keep alive,
should you know,
caching bottles in and shit.

1428
01:24:47.690 --> 01:24:51.980
And um,
I was start growing more and my food,
you know,

1429
01:24:51.981 --> 01:24:54.410
and I start giving the food away and the reason,

1430
01:24:54.411 --> 01:24:59.250
that's why I haven't on the street,
Ted,
find out about you.
Wow.
This,

1431
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:04.010
that shit.
It was so some serendipitous shit man.
Cause what it was,

1432
01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:09.800
I see a girl,
um,
Melissa painter did a video on me for,

1433
01:25:09.801 --> 01:25:14.300
I'm just company Wondros and um,
about about,

1434
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:18.740
cause they found me on um,
on um,
the La Times.

1435
01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.710
So they came by,
hey,
find this guy,
do a piece on him.
So that,

1436
01:25:21.711 --> 01:25:23.780
so they did this piece.

1437
01:25:23.781 --> 01:25:27.730
And so one day I'm watching Ted and this,

1438
01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:30.980
the guy that did put the garden in the White House and you know,

1439
01:25:30.981 --> 01:25:34.400
he was real boring,
but I'm like,
damn,
this guy say the same shit I say,

1440
01:25:34.401 --> 01:25:38.940
but kind of white light,
you know,
and uh,

1441
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:44.360
the same kind of shit.
And so I'm like,
Damn.
So I,
I emailed Melissa like,
well,

1442
01:25:44.361 --> 01:25:47.690
check this out.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should be teaching,
maybe I should,

1443
01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:50.360
because she's all,
you need to be teaching.
You need to be doing it.
I'm like,

1444
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.750
I don't have a clue what the fuck I'm doing.
And I'm just,
you know,

1445
01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:56.960
I'm just doing it and making it happen.
And so,
so I sent it to her.

1446
01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.240
Okay.
So then,
um,
uh,
I don't know,
30,

1447
01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.580
40 minutes later go back to my computer and this,

1448
01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:08.810
this message on the computer says,
Hi Ron,
we've been watching you.

1449
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.220
And I literally pushed my seat away from the table and I'm,
I literally,

1450
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:15.260
there's nobody,
even in all,
I said,
what the fuck is up?

1451
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:21.680
And I read Ted said something about Ted.
Dot.
We want you to come to Vancouver.

1452
01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.740
And I didn't even finish reading it.
I'm like,
yeah,
how hot.
Real funny.

1453
01:26:24.741 --> 01:26:29.210
So I sent Melissa emails like,
yeah,
you real funny dude.
You know.

1454
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:33.130
Oh,
I sent it back to them though.
Who the fuck is Miller?
Who's Melissa?

1455
01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:37.370
That's what I get.
And I'm like,
yeah.
Right.
So I sent her on her email.

1456
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.590
She's caught,
are you

1457
01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.670
<v 4>[inaudible] have anything to do with it?</v>

1458
01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.540
<v 1>My air.
Right.
I talked to you and send you a Ted.
In 30 minutes later,</v>

1459
01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.290
I'm getting invited to Canada to do tit.
That's how that should happen.

1460
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:55.420
So they saw to her video on one of the guys who's now one of my good friends,

1461
01:26:55.530 --> 01:26:59.770
um,
nick wine bar.
He,
he,
he found a video online.

1462
01:26:59.771 --> 01:27:01.000
That's what he does for tech.

1463
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:04.990
They literally scoured the Internet and different places and fine.

1464
01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.770
You find these stories and um,
that's how I wound up doing the Ted,

1465
01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:13.000
which was called the worldwide talent search.
They had never done it before,

1466
01:27:13.001 --> 01:27:16.000
so they literally went around the world looking for speakers.

1467
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.890
And where I came in,
I was,
I was so last,
but I wasn't even,

1468
01:27:20.891 --> 01:27:24.340
even in none of the brochures because they finally,
then we got head,
his guy.

1469
01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.640
So I was the last person in the last city of the whole tour and I was the last

1470
01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:35.740
person on stage and I had never done that shit.
The four,
well,
you did great.

1471
01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:39.340
No,
no,
that was never done.
Let's see.

1472
01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:43.540
This one got me to that one.
Okay.
So it was like a,
almost like an audition.

1473
01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:48.610
I didn't know.
Yeah,
it was,
and I almost,
I said,
Brian,
you could just,
just leave,

1474
01:27:48.611 --> 01:27:52.570
just get on a plane and go.
You're going to embarrass yourself,
dude.

1475
01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.860
It's like,
leave,
leave.
You're gonna to embarrass your son.
Were you nervous?

1476
01:27:56.950 --> 01:28:01.630
Fuck yeah.
I was nervous.
Are you kidding me?
Well,

1477
01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:04.870
were you nervous?
Just public speaking as well,
the whole thing.

1478
01:28:04.871 --> 01:28:08.770
And being dyslexic and screwing up the lines that I thought I was supposed to

1479
01:28:08.771 --> 01:28:11.380
read and no one paid attention,
no one there.

1480
01:28:11.381 --> 01:28:15.490
They thought it's because they saw this video that was shot over its days.

1481
01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:17.200
They thought around,
we're not worried about you.

1482
01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:20.590
And I was looking at these college kids and these professionals and they have

1483
01:28:20.591 --> 01:28:25.450
these polished as pro presentations and I'm like,
Damn Dude,

1484
01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.180
how are you going to compete with them?
But why?
Why?

1485
01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.590
I wound up being the last one.

1486
01:28:29.591 --> 01:28:34.330
And I wound up getting a standing ovation that was in Vancouver.
So that's how,

1487
01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:39.400
that's how,
that's what happened to.
So I just let,
I literally,
I remember Joe,

1488
01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.840
my foot was about to hit the stage and I said,
dude,
you got to represent,

1489
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:46.510
you gotta represent Yo son was,
you got to represent your hood.

1490
01:28:46.511 --> 01:28:48.340
You got to represent La,
you got to represent,

1491
01:28:48.341 --> 01:28:51.060
you can't come in this country and fuck up and right.

1492
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:52.930
And when my foot hit the stage,

1493
01:28:52.931 --> 01:28:55.840
I literally still at the bullets forwarding gonna Fall,
you know?

1494
01:28:55.841 --> 01:28:59.800
And that in the end I went out in our,
our rock days.
I mean you,
if you watch it,

1495
01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:03.120
you can see the nerves kind of.
But if,
you know,

1496
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:07.410
compared to my two big 10 big Ted,
that shit was just like,

1497
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:12.370
oh,
I should change.
It's changed my life dude.

1498
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.410
And a sense of,

1499
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.990
from the moment I Gannon stays to the moment I went off stage,
it was just,
Eh,

1500
01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:22.320
it ain't stop.
I mean that,
that was,
I didn't expect that.

1501
01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.970
I didn't expect that kind of,
I didn't expect that dude.

1502
01:29:26.971 --> 01:29:30.720
I didn't expect people to react.
Like I didn't expect that kind of reaction.

1503
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.490
<v 2>Well,
it makes sense.
It all makes sense.
And you do a great job.
I mean,</v>

1504
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:39.050
what you're saying makes sense.
And you do a great job of expressing yourself in,

1505
01:29:39.051 --> 01:29:42.960
in a,
in an authentic way.
You are you on stage,
right?

1506
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:45.810
You're not trying to be somebody,
you're not a politician who,

1507
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:47.610
me too fucking good.

1508
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:52.710
<v 1>I can be.
No.
And I tell people don't change.
But that's good.
No,
it was,</v>

1509
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.800
it was an,
and I think that's what threw me,

1510
01:29:55.801 --> 01:29:59.310
because you hear hearing all these brilliant people,

1511
01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:02.460
all these academics,
and they,
you know,
when all these people would,

1512
01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:06.120
all these dudes,
you know,
letters behind their name,

1513
01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:10.110
Phd and all that Bush and then my remedial ass,
you know what I'm saying?

1514
01:30:10.111 --> 01:30:13.620
And it's like,
how do we do,
why are you even here?

1515
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:18.060
<v 2>God is,
that's authentic and refreshing to a lot of people,
like the people,</v>

1516
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:23.450
they're getting tired of hearing the same sorta land monotone.

1517
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.530
You're being yourself and also your message resonates.

1518
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.590
Like it makes sense to people.
But hearing what you're saying,
they're like,
yeah,

1519
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:36.580
why don't we grow our own food?
Yeah.
That would be a great utilization of space.

1520
01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:39.100
<v 1>So,
no,
when I saw,
I mean,
I got,</v>

1521
01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:43.150
I got a massive standing ovation from there and it was,

1522
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:47.440
it that,
that I,
it hit me,
man.
It was like,
whoa.

1523
01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:51.050
And I'm too in,
it just,

1524
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:56.200
it just changed everything.
Wow.
It just changed everything in the end.
I mean,
I,
I,

1525
01:30:56.201 --> 01:31:00.920
um,
I got,
I got mad respect for Ted,
you know,
I mean,
a lot of people are,

1526
01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:04.930
it's a call with,
it's this,
it's this,
it's what I always hear.
I know you had,

1527
01:31:04.931 --> 01:31:07.300
what's his Eddie Wong.
You had Eddie,
I saw your shit.

1528
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:12.000
<v 2>Yeah.
Anybody that Eddie's rich and they're trying to make them have a roommate.</v>

1529
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.980
Right.
Was like,
can I get my own fucking hotel?

1530
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.790
<v 1>He could've got his whole fucking room stop,
dude.</v>

1531
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:22.560
He doesn't lie that he's not a liar.
Did they make you stay with somebody?

1532
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:25.170
No.
No.
I just stay by herself.

1533
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:29.430
Maybe that's why they didn't make me stay back with a scared

1534
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.730
little Chinese guy.
That motherfucker in the room with somebody else.

1535
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:40.650
It's funny because I did,
I did this.
I had the best time.

1536
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:45.150
I did this conference called mad for him.
Um,
you know,
in Copenhagen,
you know,

1537
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:48.310
native Sepi,
who's the owns noma,
which is,
you know,

1538
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:50.700
notice the best restaurant in the world.

1539
01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:55.740
And this conference was like all chefs and food writers,

1540
01:31:55.741 --> 01:31:58.770
like food people from literally all over the world,
man.

1541
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.820
And I had a girl to come visit me,
she,
I met her there and she came,

1542
01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.890
visited me to,
to talk about a project and she says,
yeah,
Ron,
you,

1543
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.610
you came out and you scared everybody,
you know,

1544
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:14.611
but it was like you changed the whole co you changed the whole atmosphere of the

1545
01:32:14.711 --> 01:32:19.390
whole conference after you,
you know,
cause basically once I did my piece,

1546
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:21.480
it wasn't everybody just fired.

1547
01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:24.870
Everybody just got naked if I get and just like let it hang out.
Yeah.

1548
01:32:24.871 --> 01:32:29.170
There wasn't none of that pretentious bullshit.
And she said,
but I said,
I scared.

1549
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.590
What did I do?
She says,
you just came out and,

1550
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:34.990
and you told people to raise their hands up and cause I did this thing for

1551
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:39.950
Ferguson there,
you know,
and I'm like that.
I said,
Oh yeah,
the big black guy.
Ah,

1552
01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.450
you know.
So it's funny,
it's funny to hear that though.

1553
01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.900
I don't see it,
but,
um,
you know,
it's,
I,

1554
01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.590
I've had a lot of fun and I met a lot of great people,

1555
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:53.440
but I've also this shit where,
you know,
I got people,

1556
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:58.550
this woman and they want me to come to this place in Ireland and this is what I

1557
01:32:58.781 --> 01:32:59.080
get.

1558
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.680
They want you to come and they're going to pay your fare and they're going to

1559
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:04.920
put you up.
But they're not giving,
you know,
paper,
you know,
they ain't,

1560
01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:08.350
it ain't no honorarium.
Danes giving,
you know,
speaker's fee.
And it's like,
what?

1561
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:12.910
You want me to do a keynote and you want me to do,
uh,
you know,
a panel.

1562
01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.810
So basically it comes,
it's almost like I'm entertaining your people

1563
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.540
<v 3>and they're paying to get into this conference,
may add money.</v>

1564
01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:22.070
What the fuck is that?

1565
01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:25.840
<v 1>Um,
you get that a lot man,
where it's like,
you know,
people were in,</v>

1566
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:29.800
I have to to end and shit,
so I get this shitty ass email just like,
well,

1567
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:34.050
I guess no one else ans asked him for honorarium or fee.

1568
01:33:34.051 --> 01:33:38.390
So I guess this is not a fit for Ron.
Good luck in what he does at a diner.

1569
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:43.190
And it was like real snarky kind of kind of like the nerve of you to ask us to

1570
01:33:43.191 --> 01:33:43.840
pay you.

1571
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.270
<v 3>Right.
But you don't do what you do for free.</v>

1572
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:48.580
This I send my kids to private school.

1573
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:53.050
Well you know they have that south by southwest festival festival.

1574
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:57.730
I keynoted I opened south by southwest eco last year.

1575
01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.860
I was the key.
I opened whole conference and they will never show my video.

1576
01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:06.340
I say something crazy.
No,
I mean I kind of clown.

1577
01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:09.370
I clowned him just about what we're talking about,
you know,
about,

1578
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:10.480
about not paying people.

1579
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:15.180
They offered to have me come down and they wanted me to perform there and uh,
do,

1580
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.820
do some fucking thing they were doing on podcasts and they,

1581
01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.880
they offered me a pass to go to see and they're like this passage where $1,200

1582
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:28.690
to see all these other fucking people who aren't getting paid,

1583
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.740
they want or need a fly in on my own dime myself and pay for my own fucking food

1584
01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:39.080
and work for free.
And they were going to give me a pass.
I was like,
no,

1585
01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:42.280
and do you see how much money they make?

1586
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:46.530
<v 1>And,
and what I did,
literally,
I didn't go deep,</v>

1587
01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:49.740
but I did kind of see,
I mean,
I told the whole all,
I said,

1588
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:53.730
hold on a minute and this,
you know,
and I had a tip,
I had a bucket of friend,

1589
01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.770
a paint bucket,
and I had a sign assists tips.
I said,
hold on.

1590
01:34:57.810 --> 01:35:01.400
So I got the tape and I put tips on the bucket.
Then I got on stage.

1591
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:05.390
People are fucking dying laughing,
you know,
some of the tweets were like,
oh,

1592
01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:09.170
Ron Finley just entered the stage with a tip bucket details later,
you know,

1593
01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:13.790
so and,
and I kind of clowned him about,
you know,
why am I here?

1594
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:14.743
You know?

1595
01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:18.250
<v 2>No,
it's,
southwest airlines is a fucking big company.</v>

1596
01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:20.680
They have a lot of money and they're the sponsor of this whole thing.

1597
01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.500
It's called south by southwest.

1598
01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:26.740
They have a fucking southwest airlines plane on all their pictures and brochures

1599
01:35:26.741 --> 01:35:28.960
and shit.
Like,
where's the money going?

1600
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:33.100
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
no,
it's,
it's,
it's,
but it's exposure.</v>

1601
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:37.900
Joe,
you need to,
I tell you,
you know what I say about exposure?
I said,

1602
01:35:37.901 --> 01:35:42.820
too much exposure.
Give you an ammonia,
your knife.
Frostbite.
Yeah,
exactly.

1603
01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:46.930
Tia.
Dude.
You know who's going to be in the audience,
Joe?
No,
I need a check,
dude.

1604
01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.990
Fuck who's in the audience?
You know what I'm saying?
So your response,

1605
01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.400
that's not your responsibility.

1606
01:35:51.401 --> 01:35:55.720
If you want me to come somewhere and you want me to inspire and do what I do,

1607
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:59.800
I need to check because you're taking me from what I do and it should be

1608
01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.840
<v 2>as well.
It's like the exposure should be as well as financial compensation.</v>

1609
01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:06.600
Thank you.
It's like,
yeah,
there should be some exposure.

1610
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.070
They should be able to say,
hey,
Ron will be able to pay your fee,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1611
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:12.450
and here's a good thing for you.
It's exposure.

1612
01:36:12.451 --> 01:36:17.100
But the say that the exposure is your pay.
He was fucking ridiculous.

1613
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:21.430
<v 1>That's really,
I did get,
I did get a,
I did,
I think,</v>

1614
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.980
well they reimbursed me for my flight.

1615
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:28.660
<v 2>Aww.
How cute is that?
We remember.
That's insane.
It's insane.</v>

1616
01:36:28.661 --> 01:36:32.260
If they're charging money for people to perform and the not paying the people,

1617
01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:36.820
<v 1>I mean that,
that's one,
that's one of my things now,
so,
and everybody's,</v>

1618
01:36:36.821 --> 01:36:40.930
and I want to send this woman a real bad letter just to say,
you know,

1619
01:36:40.931 --> 01:36:43.120
just like you don't do what you do for free.

1620
01:36:43.121 --> 01:36:47.290
Don't think that I'm supposed to be honored to come and speak on to pound on a

1621
01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:51.190
panel and keynote your event for free.
Just because you've given me a ticket

1622
01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.850
<v 2>and it's a conference.
It's,
I mean,
it's just things festival.</v>

1623
01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:57.540
It's sponsored by a major corporation.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1624
01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.120
It's profitable.
It's a profitable thing.

1625
01:37:00.150 --> 01:37:02.730
There's a lot of people that are working there.
They're all getting paid

1626
01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:07.680
<v 1>to do what they do.
Exactly.
Then.
So no,
I don't.
And everybody's like,</v>

1627
01:37:07.681 --> 01:37:09.210
well Ron,
and I'm like,
damn,

1628
01:37:09.210 --> 01:37:13.050
<v 2>damn fucking scam.
It's 100% of scamp and people fall for it.</v>

1629
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:16.440
And apparently they pay some people,
you know,
they pay some people.

1630
01:37:16.441 --> 01:37:19.590
Everybody's getting the same thing.
Not really.
No.

1631
01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.590
Some people apparently get paid and that's one of the reasons why they keep it

1632
01:37:22.591 --> 01:37:25.350
very high profile.
You know,
big bands and shit like that.

1633
01:37:25.351 --> 01:37:27.810
They get a certain amount of money is,
but it's the,

1634
01:37:27.811 --> 01:37:30.840
I don't know how those things got started,
but when they offered it to me,

1635
01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:33.860
they offered it to Dunkin first.
My friend Duncan trussell's,

1636
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:35.250
a very funny standup comedian,

1637
01:37:35.251 --> 01:37:39.360
but at the time Dunkin wasn't very well known and you know,
and he was like,
wait,

1638
01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.030
do you want me to fly there and work for free?

1639
01:37:42.031 --> 01:37:46.830
So he made a video about it using that,
the Hitler speech,

1640
01:37:46.831 --> 01:37:50.610
I don't know if you ever see the Hitler speech where people do this a video,

1641
01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:51.700
it's just been a month,

1642
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:56.750
a hundred of them made of Hitler ranting and German and the titles of what he's

1643
01:37:57.271 --> 01:38:00.900
actually saying it was Hitler going off about south by southwest,

1644
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:05.660
making people work for free.
It's fucking crazy.
It's crazy.
It is.

1645
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:08.310
That is a God damn huge.
Huge

1646
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.340
<v 1>when that's just one of them,
man.</v>

1647
01:38:10.341 --> 01:38:14.510
And a lot of them have a lot of them do that.
And it's like I've had,

1648
01:38:14.511 --> 01:38:18.380
I've had so many,
so many,
so,
so much.
Well,
so much for the movement.
Oh,

1649
01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.800
you want you at your feet so much for the movement.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1650
01:38:22.190 --> 01:38:25.130
It's like,
what do you mean what I'm supposed to do?
What I do?

1651
01:38:25.131 --> 01:38:29.580
I'm supposed to fly to you and in,
in,
and work for free.
And it's because of this.

1652
01:38:29.581 --> 01:38:31.040
So what you call it a movement.

1653
01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:34.850
<v 2>Well,
but meanwhile
it's not like there's no money.</v>

1654
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.480
That's what's ridiculous.
It's one thing if this conference was free,

1655
01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:42.410
everybody can attend for free.
If they people donated food,

1656
01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:46.700
they donated hotel rooms every,
oh,
everybody's working for free.
Okay,

1657
01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:48.530
but that's not what's happening there.

1658
01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:52.700
Check this fucking thing that they sent me where they said,
ah,
you know,
hey,

1659
01:38:52.701 --> 01:38:56.810
we'll give you a gold pass.
It's worth 1200 bucks.
Like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

1660
01:38:56.811 --> 01:39:00.140
What the fuck did you feel insulted by that shit?
I was laughing.

1661
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:01.580
It was hilarious.

1662
01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:06.940
So you want me to go there and lend my recognition or my town or whatever and

1663
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:12.380
you're going to give me a fucking pass?
Yep.
Oh,
good Lord.

1664
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:15.690
<v 1>No,
I get it.
I get in it.
They'll try,
I guess,
you know,</v>

1665
01:39:15.691 --> 01:39:20.310
I got a cup of festivals to try to do that.
And I know,
you know that.
Um,

1666
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:25.290
it's like,
I mean,
I know that the,
I have in this game,
you know,

1667
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:29.730
they put me on this thing,
so I have on this kind of like,
oh,
Ron Finley,

1668
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.110
you know,
to me,
I'm still,
I tell people,
it's like I was in England and I,

1669
01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:38.880
they put me,
has this cathedral and shut shut Phil.
And they put my,

1670
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:42.300
they had my,
my,
my picture,
like,
what do you call it?

1671
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.200
Projected on the whole cathedral.
So you walk up and it's bigger,
you know,

1672
01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:50.160
the Pope Pitch,
I'm like,
Damn.
And so,
and I told her,
I got,
I said,
damn,

1673
01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:52.020
you guys must be bored here.

1674
01:39:52.021 --> 01:39:56.460
It's like seven o'clock on a Saturday and you're here to see me.
And it's like,

1675
01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:58.990
how do you even know who the hell I am?
And some woman yells,

1676
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.150
her famous and I said,
yeah,
my dishes still need to be washed,
you know,

1677
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:06.750
so it's like youth,
I'm not famous to me,
you know?

1678
01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:11.030
<v 2>Right,
right.
I don't know how there was conferences.</v>

1679
01:40:11.031 --> 01:40:13.980
You know how you deal with that festivals?
It's not that hard.

1680
01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.740
It becomes like your reality shifts.

1681
01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.250
But I don't know how these festivals got away with that business model.

1682
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:25.320
I don't know who the fuck let that happen to many each year.
Trick.
Yeah.

1683
01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:28.110
Too many eager people that don't understand their value.
Oh

1684
01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:32.670
<v 1>yes,
yes,
yes.
You said it.
And that's exactly what it is.
Oh,</v>

1685
01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.930
I got a book to promote.
Ooh,
I got this.
Ooh,
if so and so's going to be there,

1686
01:40:36.931 --> 01:40:40.710
I heard he's going to be there.
Ooh.
And I'll be up.
That's exactly what it is.

1687
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.770
You don't have,
they don't have a value now.
And that's what I,

1688
01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:48.720
and that's my whole thing with this thing.
And in Ireland you're,
you're,
you're,

1689
01:40:48.721 --> 01:40:52.890
you're insulted because I know I have a value.
So you,
you,

1690
01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:56.170
that's what it is,
man.
It's like people,
they I need to get somewhere.

1691
01:40:56.171 --> 01:40:59.170
It's cause I have this product,
I need to get somewhere because you know,

1692
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:02.560
and if I,
if I do here and then I'll go there and that's,
that's what it is.

1693
01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:04.180
<v 2>Right?
It's the south by southwest.</v>

1694
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.090
Rene's people that they claimed that all the money goes to charity or anything.

1695
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:10.120
I have no idea.
I've never heard of that before.
I have no,
I don't think so.

1696
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.600
I mean,
we're complaining too much about something I think,
but the,
the,

1697
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.430
the idea of you not being compensated for it like that,
it's like,

1698
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:20.710
oh so much for the movement.
That's fucking insulting.

1699
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:23.980
That's insulting because they,
you know,
they would never say that.

1700
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.150
<v 1>Well that was,
that was some cost.
Some organization back east,</v>

1701
01:41:28.151 --> 01:41:30.850
I don't even remember who they were,
but that was the email.
Once they tow,

1702
01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.300
this is his fee and this is what he gets.
And that's what I got back.

1703
01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:37.920
And it's like,
people say,
well,
aren't you a nonprofit?
I'm like,
no.
My nonprofits,

1704
01:41:37.921 --> 01:41:39.760
the nonprofit,
I'm Ron Finley,

1705
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:41.060
<v 2>he needed,
he needed a check.</v>

1706
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:45.440
How the fuck you supposed to pay your rent?

1707
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:49.700
How the fuck am I supposed to fill your gas tank?
It's,
people are weird,
man.

1708
01:41:49.701 --> 01:41:53.750
People are weird.
They're weird with how they look at other people and fairness,

1709
01:41:53.751 --> 01:41:55.270
you know,
and,
and,
and,

1710
01:41:55.330 --> 01:42:00.330
and especially someone who's legitimately got something that's important to say.

1711
01:42:00.710 --> 01:42:03.260
And somehow or another,
if you've got something that's important to say,

1712
01:42:03.261 --> 01:42:04.220
you should be doing it for no money

1713
01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.600
<v 1>is that,
well I think it's that whole Mother Teresa Shit.</v>

1714
01:42:07.601 --> 01:42:12.601
Or You have these kids coming out of college now that have trained in no profits

1715
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:18.400
so,
and they have them thinking that you're doing good so you don't have to have,

1716
01:42:18.401 --> 01:42:22.730
you shouldn't get paid that law,
you know,
there's not money to pay you.
But the,

1717
01:42:22.731 --> 01:42:25.450
the executive this run is like you said something about one of these

1718
01:42:25.451 --> 01:42:25.991
corporations,

1719
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:29.260
it's morning where the money is and cross the Red Cross is where the money,
yeah,

1720
01:42:29.261 --> 01:42:31.420
he's probably getting,
you know,
a couple of million dollars,

1721
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:33.910
but the people on the ground,
same thing with one of the,

1722
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.690
I don't remember if it was a good wheel of one of them where they were paying

1723
01:42:37.691 --> 01:42:40.390
people like a quarter or somewhere at hand because they had,

1724
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.870
but some writing where they could do some ridiculous ass price.

1725
01:42:43.871 --> 01:42:46.670
They were paying people that were working there,
you know,

1726
01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:50.560
handicap people in different shit.
So it's like that just because you,

1727
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:54.640
it says in writing that you can do that.
Does that make that shit right?
You know,

1728
01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:58.840
so,
so in that,
and that's,
that's,
that's where I'm at with it,
man.
I don't,

1729
01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:01.330
I mean I do a gang of shit for free,

1730
01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:04.810
a gammy and I was growing putting in gardens and everything for free.
You know,

1731
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.840
my thing,
a lot of times people don't respect that.

1732
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:09.970
I think you need a value on shit.

1733
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:13.800
<v 2>Well,
especially if they're charging money to hear you speak right.</v>

1734
01:43:13.801 --> 01:43:16.620
That's where it gets ridiculous and you realize that they're making profit off

1735
01:43:16.621 --> 01:43:19.930
of it.
And that's,
all of those organizations are making profit.

1736
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:24.960
That's why they exist.
I mean,
even Ted,
Ted has become this huge business,

1737
01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:28.470
you know,
and without a doubt they do benefit because I enjoy Ted talks.

1738
01:43:28.471 --> 01:43:31.740
I found out about you through Ted talks.
I've watched them all the time.

1739
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.160
I was watching one today on fucking the engineered proteins that are causing a

1740
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:41.780
different food allergies and you know,
and,

1741
01:43:41.781 --> 01:43:46.110
and how antibiotics and foods and all this different shit and all those things

1742
01:43:46.111 --> 01:43:50.070
are incredibly educational.
All those speeches and Ted talks are fascinating,

1743
01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:52.040
but once you start

1744
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.910
<v 1>getting money,
once money becomes a part of the thing.
You know,</v>

1745
01:43:55.911 --> 01:43:58.550
people start trying to maximize the profits and people still.

1746
01:43:58.551 --> 01:44:02.480
But I mean like what Ted,
I mean Chris is a lot of these guys,

1747
01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:05.990
they started out rich,
he bought ticket from,
you know,
from another guy.

1748
01:44:05.991 --> 01:44:10.740
So I mean he,
they got paper,
you know,
but I,
I don't,
I think it's,
it gets to,

1749
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:11.810
you know,
a penis show.

1750
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.580
I got more paper than you watch what I'm [inaudible] it's like,
uh,
but,

1751
01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:19.490
but I mean,
I got mad respect for Chris,
you know,
I mean,

1752
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:23.870
the fact that they let that,
they let people use the tabs and it's like,
oh damn,

1753
01:44:23.871 --> 01:44:27.820
this is like open source.
It was like,
like with a Ron,
you want this,

1754
01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.250
they'll call you want this person to use your tag for it.

1755
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:34.650
They want to put it here.
And I'm like,
yeah,
cool.
So it's like they give you that,

1756
01:44:34.651 --> 01:44:39.010
that kind of consideration.
And for you,
the more it gets spread,
the better.
Right.

1757
01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:39.853
The more people,

1758
01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.260
the more people talk about the more your ideas come out there.

1759
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.170
I've had kids,
I had,
one of the coolest things,
man,
is I had these kids to,

1760
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:55.490
this father sends me pictures of his kids.
They're probably like 10,

1761
01:44:55.770 --> 01:44:57.570
11 and um,

1762
01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:01.490
they're calling themselves gangsta gardeners and they send him pictures of them,

1763
01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.080
like growing,
like propagating plants and seeing,
he says in the recruiting area,

1764
01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:06.460
you know,

1765
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:10.940
other gangsters from the neighborhood to grow food and this is an Indian.

1766
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:13.400
I'm like,
you know,
if a friend of mine was,

1767
01:45:13.401 --> 01:45:17.630
we used to work in Africa and in the Bush he says,
this guy said,
man,

1768
01:45:17.631 --> 01:45:20.690
this guy probably has a wooden computers,
so fucking,
oh,
you know,

1769
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:25.691
so he says this guy's rides a bike 20 miles to use the phone and he hasn't heard

1770
01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:28.880
from him in years.
And all of a sudden he's like,
hey mark,

1771
01:45:28.881 --> 01:45:33.500
you work in south central,
right?
There's this guy,
you should find him.
You know,

1772
01:45:33.501 --> 01:45:37.370
his name is Ron Finley.
I saw him on Ted and he's in.
Mark says,
Dude.

1773
01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:41.540
And once he tells me this story,
he was like,
Yo,
he just shaking his head.
He said,

1774
01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:44.010
dude,
this guy lives in the bush.
You know,

1775
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.140
so you know.
So it's been crazy to me.
Oh my God.

1776
01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:54.730
Well see what happened.
It's too untethered.

1777
01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:57.650
It says 2 million.
I don't know,
a couple of hundred thousand.

1778
01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:02.030
But what that doesn't count Joe is when people see it at a college.

1779
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:06.290
When people see it in a school room,
when people see it in,
in um,

1780
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:09.500
in the auditorium,
when they see it at the movies cause it's showing a movie.

1781
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.910
So those,
those people are not date,

1782
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:16.040
those numbers are not co are counted.

1783
01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:19.940
So it might be an extra million or 2 million fucking easy.

1784
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.710
I mean cause you think like with,
with um,
my video was probably one of the most,

1785
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:29.030
when you do a Ted x,
you have to show a ted video.

1786
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.360
And my ted literally has been shown probably one of the most around the world.

1787
01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.820
Like when they do a tedx because they sit in,
you know,
the people say,
Hey,

1788
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:41.090
we just watched your video.
Hey,
we just watched your video and you know,

1789
01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:44.420
in Amsterdam or what not,
you know,
in the Middle East and shit like that.

1790
01:46:44.421 --> 01:46:49.040
So the numbers are pretty staggering.
But what,
what you,

1791
01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:53.520
what really hits me is people go to action.
You know,

1792
01:46:53.521 --> 01:46:57.420
there's a guy saw my video in Brazil and um,
you know,

1793
01:46:57.421 --> 01:47:01.980
he contacted me,
you know.
Yeah,
yeah.
Next thing I know,
like a couple of,
uh,

1794
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:02.850
like a month ago,

1795
01:47:02.851 --> 01:47:06.760
he's on the news in Brazil and they s somebody sends me the clip where he says

1796
01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.570
he's talking me up in Brazil.
Like,
yeah,
we,
oh,

1797
01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:12.790
we took this lot because of the Ron Finley and soft syndrome,
you know,

1798
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.640
the other than it's like,
whoa.
So that kind of Shit it,
that touches me,

1799
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:20.850
man,
that this word,
I don't have to be there.
That's the whole thing.

1800
01:47:20.851 --> 01:47:24.490
People we need none of,
no,
you,
me,
dude,
I don't need to be there.
You are me.

1801
01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:27.070
<v 3>How many years has it been since this all started?</v>

1802
01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:32.100
Since the first Ted in Vancouver first tip was 2012.

1803
01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:34.360
So it's only been a little more,
which matters.

1804
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.100
<v 1>Yeah.
The,
and it feels like six.
I mean,
no,</v>

1805
01:47:38.101 --> 01:47:42.450
it feels like easy.
I swear it's,
I,
when I look,

1806
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:46.530
I cannot believe what's transpired in the short,
very,
very,

1807
01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:48.350
very short amount of time.
And the,

1808
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:51.990
one of the biggest things that the law has been changed,
you know,
to,

1809
01:47:51.991 --> 01:47:56.880
to allow you to grow food on your parkway in Los Angeles.
Uh,

1810
01:47:56.970 --> 01:48:01.450
I,
um,
it's,
to me I'm humbled,
you know,
that,

1811
01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:04.800
that it's,
that it's happening like this where kids are calling me,
hey Ron,

1812
01:48:04.801 --> 01:48:08.880
we're in Boston.
We don't have the green spaces,
but we have,
we have roofs.

1813
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:13.590
How can we take your project farther?
You know,
so,
um,

1814
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.050
that kind of thing.
You know,

1815
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.060
this kid in Texas where it start planning food on his front yard and all his

1816
01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:23.160
parkway and he calls it his front yard,
dock yard,

1817
01:48:23.161 --> 01:48:27.450
grocery store for his neighborhood.
Wow.
So,
I mean,
that kind of inspiration,

1818
01:48:27.451 --> 01:48:32.010
Joe has been just been like,
you can't,

1819
01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.550
who could have thought this man?
You know,
I,
I w I wouldn't have thought that,

1820
01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:39.670
you know,
I got kids from Oregon University coming,
you know,

1821
01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.320
to see my garden or kids driving down from,

1822
01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:47.850
I'm from up north to work in my garden,

1823
01:48:47.851 --> 01:48:52.440
just hey.
So it's been,
it's us almost like,
um,
some,

1824
01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.660
um,
cult shit.
I don't know.
It's like we want to meet you,
we want it,

1825
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:59.730
we want to touch the soil that you worked in kind of thing.

1826
01:48:59.810 --> 01:49:00.111
<v 3>You know?</v>

1827
01:49:00.111 --> 01:49:05.111
So it's amazing because what you're doing is like such a basic normal human

1828
01:49:05.661 --> 01:49:08.180
thing to do that we've been doing for thousands of years.

1829
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:12.020
And that's why it still astonishes me that

1830
01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:14.390
<v 1>it's people who are putting this on.</v>

1831
01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.920
I see why when I hear the conversations and when we see where the world is

1832
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.010
because it's almost like,
oh yeah,
I forgot about that.

1833
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:26.990
I can do that because we don't have no skin in the game.
Joe,
you,
you,
you go,

1834
01:49:26.991 --> 01:49:31.991
you talk into a box and you drive 20 feet and then they hand you a box of shit

1835
01:49:32.181 --> 01:49:34.160
that supposed to be food.
You know what I'm saying?

1836
01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:37.910
And you drive off and you took the good,
there's no skin in the game.

1837
01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:42.290
And I think that's why.
So that's to me is like part of the whole slavery shit.

1838
01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:44.750
You know,
it's like you're,
you're a slave to that rhythm.

1839
01:49:44.751 --> 01:49:48.790
You're a slave to that because now you don't,
that that's making you weak,

1840
01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.670
um,
that you're,

1841
01:49:50.671 --> 01:49:53.530
you're being controlled now you're gonna it's like the monk pushed the button

1842
01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:56.090
and you know the Pavlov Dog Shit,
you know,

1843
01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.880
ringing the bell and you start salivating.

1844
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.181
<v 2>Well,</v>

1845
01:49:58.181 --> 01:50:02.110
I think there's a movement going on right now and you see a lot of different

1846
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:06.040
places in our society where people realize,
hey,

1847
01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:09.610
we are live in exactly the same way our parents lived.

1848
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.100
And as we get older we realize they didn't really know what the fuck they were

1849
01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:16.090
young.
So everybody steps back and says,
Hey,

1850
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.930
maybe we should exercise more.
What kind of exercise and should we do?

1851
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:22.990
Maybe we should do shit that people have been doing for thousands of years.

1852
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:25.840
Strong man,
type shit.
Do dead lifts,
do squats.

1853
01:50:25.841 --> 01:50:29.160
That's where this whole crossfit things coming from.
What is it coming from?

1854
01:50:29.161 --> 01:50:31.930
When people realize that if you lift weights,
you feel stronger.

1855
01:50:31.931 --> 01:50:35.290
If you feel stronger,
you feel better,
you be healthier.
Okay.
What about food?

1856
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:38.500
People are realizing,
hey,
you know,
you're not supposed to feed cows.
Corn,

1857
01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:42.220
corn fed beef is fucking bad for you.
Hey,
I'm going to eat grass fed beef.

1858
01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:42.611
Hey look,

1859
01:50:42.611 --> 01:50:47.470
the fat in grass fed beef has actually higher and essential fatty acids.

1860
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:50.950
It's better for you than meat is healthier.
It's a healthier animal.

1861
01:50:50.951 --> 01:50:54.700
That's why it's leaner.
Okay,
what's lead?
Let's see,
let's eat that more.
Hey,

1862
01:50:54.850 --> 01:50:56.950
organic vegetables are probably better for you.

1863
01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.510
Let's fucking eat more organic vegetables.

1864
01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.840
And he'd see these fucking whole foods and Arrow ones are popping up all over

1865
01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:05.770
the place and exorbitant rates,
exorbitant.
And people like.

1866
01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:09.640
And then people like,
Hey,
you know what?
This fucking dirt right here.

1867
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:11.890
Why don't we grow our own shit?

1868
01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:16.920
So it seems like this is part of this movement of realization and you are in

1869
01:51:17.411 --> 01:51:20.260
that you're a part of this movement of realization.
Yeah.

1870
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:22.930
This show is a part of this movement of realization.

1871
01:51:22.931 --> 01:51:26.290
We're all a petition because this show is connected to the Internet and there's

1872
01:51:26.291 --> 01:51:28.150
no,
there's no network behind it.

1873
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:32.320
There's no person's telling us what to do so we can have someone like you on

1874
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:33.840
just because we want to write.

1875
01:51:33.850 --> 01:51:37.090
Because it's interesting because it's an interesting conversation and then more

1876
01:51:37.091 --> 01:51:40.090
people are tuning in.
They know there's no agenda and they go,
oh,

1877
01:51:40.091 --> 01:51:43.660
this guy is telling me I can grow my own food and he's not even trying to get

1878
01:51:43.661 --> 01:51:44.494
any money out of me.

1879
01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.290
It's just trying to tell me to grow my own food in my backyard.

1880
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:48.880
He's telling me about compost,

1881
01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:52.690
he's telling me how he got started just simply to spread the information

1882
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:55.300
<v 1>I saw.
I just saw sickness,
man.
You know,</v>

1883
01:51:55.301 --> 01:51:57.880
you walk out your door and you see sickness and it's like,

1884
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:02.410
and then when you go somewhere else and you see the same thing and it's like,

1885
01:52:02.411 --> 01:52:06.850
damn.
And that's when I came up this,
this is why as well as this parallel.

1886
01:52:06.851 --> 01:52:10.870
Why is this the same?
You know?
So we have to take that,
we need skin and again,

1887
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:14.770
and it's like,
that's why my whole thing grow your own shit.
You know,
and not,

1888
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:17.770
you don't have end,
like you said,
you don't have to grow everything yourself.

1889
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:20.500
Right.
But if you do it collectively with your neighbors,

1890
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:24.490
that's what I'm talking about.
It's like where you grow in the apples and the,

1891
01:52:24.491 --> 01:52:28.200
and the carrots and Sally down the street is going some chart and rhubarb,

1892
01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:30.080
whatever the hell.
So now you've,

1893
01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:34.450
you can't trade food and I can send my son to Yo spot until Yo give me some

1894
01:52:34.451 --> 01:52:37.930
carrots to Joe's house and that's,
and vice a versa.
You know,

1895
01:52:37.931 --> 01:52:41.590
you can send them over to my house and get some onions.
That's what I see,
man.

1896
01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.570
That's,
that's what it was.

1897
01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:46.940
So you have eliminated a couple of systems and you've created community,

1898
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:51.590
you created partnerships,
you create a business without,
without a money exchange,

1899
01:52:51.930 --> 01:52:55.940
you know,
and,
and you've created safety,
you know,
so,

1900
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.110
so that's,

1901
01:52:57.230 --> 01:53:00.920
and it's so damn simple to me and I guess it's going gonna take me away.

1902
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:04.550
It's so simple.
It as like you,
but you guys know this,
right?

1903
01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:09.290
<v 2>You know,
you want,
you're not talking about something that's like,</v>

1904
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:11.090
just been discovered,

1905
01:53:11.130 --> 01:53:15.800
some new technology that has recently been released to the public.

1906
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:19.790
Yes,
yes,
yes.
And that's,
it's,
that's why as to me,
it's,

1907
01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:24.470
it's still somewhat mind boggling,
you know,
100% mine boggling.

1908
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.810
And what you said about community as giant,

1909
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.620
because I think people live in this weird place now where we barely even know

1910
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:34.160
our neighbors.
You know?
And the more populated areas are,

1911
01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.960
the less likely you are to know your name.

1912
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.550
<v 1>And that's what I'm saying.
That's where the safety comes in.
Cause I know,</v>

1913
01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.100
I know your son and I know he shouldn't be doing that.
And I know he said,
wait,

1914
01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.430
Yo dude.
So I know.
You know,
so that's what,
that's where the safety comes in.

1915
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:48.130
Right?
And that's where,

1916
01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:51.990
that's where the neighbor hood and that's where community comes in and that's

1917
01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:56.820
what caring for one another comes in.
And,
um,
it's,
it's,
to me,

1918
01:53:56.821 --> 01:54:00.270
it's,
it's,
we can do it,
it can happen.
I mean it's,
there's too many,

1919
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:02.220
there's too many examples of this happening now

1920
01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:07.270
<v 2>are all our whole system like packing all these different people into these</v>

1921
01:54:07.271 --> 01:54:09.040
small areas and not knowing each other.

1922
01:54:09.041 --> 01:54:12.550
It's so alien to human culture for thousands and thousands of years.

1923
01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:16.510
We've known all the people that are in our tribes.
Yes,
we all have these groups.

1924
01:54:16.511 --> 01:54:19.090
We,
we help,
we help each other.
We have,
you know,

1925
01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:22.360
hunters and gatherers started out and then they developed agriculture.

1926
01:54:22.361 --> 01:54:23.530
But everybody worked together.

1927
01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:26.020
But now we get these weird things where we have cities,

1928
01:54:26.230 --> 01:54:31.030
we have a big concrete box and we stuff a fucking thousand people into it and no

1929
01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:34.210
one knows anybody.
It's weird man.
It's weird.

1930
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.190
<v 1>Well,
I mean,
yeah and I,
and that's why I tell people gardens,</v>

1931
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:41.510
they build communities,
not just food.
And it's like people with,
you know,

1932
01:54:41.511 --> 01:54:44.270
I've had these,
you know,
people come to that Wah Wah,

1933
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:47.630
so how much food can you grow on a piece of land this big,
you know,

1934
01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:50.690
talking about the parkway.
And I'm like,
I really don't give a fuck.
You know,

1935
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:53.930
I don't grow food.
I grow people.
And sometime they grow food.

1936
01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:58.490
It's not about the food.
Food is probably three or four down the,

1937
01:54:58.630 --> 01:55:01.140
the list is what you get from that.
Soils,

1938
01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:05.300
which you get from being involved is what you is what a child gets from,

1939
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:08.780
from from learning.
Okay.
From touching the soil,

1940
01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.470
from seeing that I planted a seed and now there's this big ass treat.

1941
01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:15.560
It can feed me.
Oh.
And it's got value.

1942
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:19.070
Just the stuff that this tree has hanging on,
it has value.

1943
01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:22.190
So look at all the lessons that are in that soil,
you know?

1944
01:55:22.191 --> 01:55:25.640
So that's what it is to me.
And then it comes and then it comes to food.
But,

1945
01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:29.480
but if you're not exposed to this ever at all,
you know,

1946
01:55:29.481 --> 01:55:32.420
if you just want your hot Cheetos and Takis and that bullshit,

1947
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.320
it's like [inaudible].
That's,
to me,
that's,
that's condition.
It is.

1948
01:55:36.650 --> 01:55:39.920
We can change the design of these neighborhoods just by that,

1949
01:55:39.921 --> 01:55:40.940
by changing the people.

1950
01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.990
<v 2>And there's something in our,
our genetics,
our DNA,
our,
our,</v>

1951
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.310
our,
our spirit,

1952
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:52.140
whatever it is that like really gets rewarded from growing your own food.

1953
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.620
When I picked vegetables out of my garden,
I make a salad out of them.

1954
01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:57.900
It feels great in some weird way.

1955
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.450
<v 1>Don't you think it should taste better?
I didn't know.</v>

1956
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:03.120
And you think you think is you?
You think it's like my babies.

1957
01:56:03.121 --> 01:56:05.430
They're the prettiest,
you know,
you think is one of those things.

1958
01:56:05.431 --> 01:56:09.270
But I remember when the first time I had successful watermelons,
man,

1959
01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:14.360
I had these watermelons that,
and I taste,
I'm like,
God damn,

1960
01:56:14.361 --> 01:56:17.790
I ain't never tasted in my life.
Tasted a waterman like this sign.

1961
01:56:17.791 --> 01:56:21.540
I gave some to neighbors and it's like they thought I injected the watermelon

1962
01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:25.560
with something.
You know it's sugar.
Yeah.
They don't like no dude.
I'm like,
no,

1963
01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:28.980
really hair.
And I've never been able to get that back.

1964
01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:31.650
But I thought it was one of those things.
This is my,

1965
01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:34.830
I finally got this watermelon watermelons to grow in their,
the best ever.

1966
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:36.600
And it was,
I've never taste nothing like that.

1967
01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:39.580
<v 2>I used to have this orange tree in this house that I rented in and see no,</v>

1968
01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:42.710
and they were the most fucking delicious oranges I've ever had in my life.

1969
01:56:42.711 --> 01:56:44.750
To this day.
I've never had an orange that good.
Wow.

1970
01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.710
I would pluck them right off the tree and they would be so juicy and sweet.

1971
01:56:49.130 --> 01:56:51.380
I can't,
you buy an orange and the supermarket,

1972
01:56:51.381 --> 01:56:55.790
it just doesn't taste as good as those oranges off of that just natural tree

1973
01:56:55.970 --> 01:57:00.110
with no effort.
I never put fertilizer down.
I didn't do shit.

1974
01:57:00.111 --> 01:57:04.890
It just grew oranges every year and they were amazing.
Nature happens.
Yeah,

1975
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:06.330
<v 1>that's what that's,</v>

1976
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:11.330
that's what I'm saying is that that tree is going to do what it's supposed to do

1977
01:57:11.630 --> 01:57:13.550
with very,
very little effort

1978
01:57:13.610 --> 01:57:17.870
<v 2>and we also fuck up the flavor and the nutrition and things by making them last</v>

1979
01:57:17.871 --> 01:57:20.780
longer and supermarkets on the shelf and shit lack on some shit.

1980
01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.730
Putting shall lack on them and even just engineering these vegetables to last

1981
01:57:25.731 --> 01:57:27.710
longer.
When you do that,
like tomatoes,

1982
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:31.130
my grandfather used to have this garden in Newark,
New Jersey,

1983
01:57:31.131 --> 01:57:33.630
and I don't know why New Jersey is famous for tomatoes.
Yeah.

1984
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:36.710
Something in the soil or with the seeds or whatever it is.

1985
01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:39.390
But they would have these tomatoes that like you've,
you've,

1986
01:57:39.391 --> 01:57:41.000
you've had heirloom tomatoes,

1987
01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:46.110
they taste so much different gonna fucking tomato that you regular tomato that

1988
01:57:46.111 --> 01:57:49.400
you get from a grocery store just like no oil and hard.

1989
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:52.820
They'll like from these tomatoes that kind kinda a little bit mushy to them.

1990
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:57.680
But when you slice into them like a fruit and you realize tomatoes are supposed

1991
01:57:57.681 --> 01:58:01.520
to taste like almost like a fruit,
our fruit,
they're delicious.

1992
01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.540
And the ones that you get,
like if you buy a burger from Mcdonald's,

1993
01:58:05.541 --> 01:58:08.030
you see that Pale ass fucking tomato slice.

1994
01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.790
That thing could leave live for a month on a shelf.

1995
01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:15.280
<v 1>And that's,
and that's why it's to me,
what is that?</v>

1996
01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:18.670
What's happening to this food?
This food doesn't even,
you know,
get back.

1997
01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:22.210
It doesn't even get mold on it.
Right.
You know,
so that's a problem.

1998
01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.620
That means it's not alive.

1999
01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:28.220
<v 2>And it's because they want this shit to be delivered into these neighborhoods</v>

2000
01:58:28.221 --> 01:58:29.600
that aren't growing anything.

2001
01:58:29.601 --> 01:58:33.080
And they want it to last in the trucks and last in the shelves so that they get

2002
01:58:33.081 --> 01:58:38.060
the maximum amount of money out of their effort out of what they put into it to

2003
01:58:38.061 --> 01:58:42.280
grow them and to ship them and to,
to house in the supermarkets.

2004
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:44.070
So we've developed this food.
We,

2005
01:58:44.110 --> 01:58:47.770
we've sort of developed this food that accentuates the system.
Yep.

2006
01:58:48.590 --> 01:58:52.640
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
we in that,
in,
that was my whole,
my whole thing is like,</v>

2007
01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:56.930
I guess waking up realizing,
Damn,
I've been bound bulls it all these years,

2008
01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:01.310
you know,
thinking that,
um,
you know,
they don't care about us,
you know,

2009
01:59:01.311 --> 01:59:06.170
and it's like the fact that the government led a lot of these laws be our past,

2010
01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:10.430
you know,
regulating this shit and,
you know,
regulating this,

2011
01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.700
like the fact that,
oh,
we don't,
you don't need to,
it's fine.

2012
01:59:13.701 --> 01:59:17.260
You don't need the label,
this bullshit.
What do you mean?
Can Can,
uh,

2013
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:21.250
can I know what's in my food is why,
why is it,
you know,
um,

2014
01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:23.720
I'm not cool with that,
you know?

2015
01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:24.621
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,</v>

2016
01:59:24.621 --> 01:59:27.470
I think what you're doing is really interesting and I think that's one of the

2017
01:59:27.471 --> 01:59:32.420
reasons why the Ted talk has been viewed online countless millions of times and

2018
01:59:32.421 --> 01:59:35.010
people have seen it in schools.
And the reason why it resonated with me,

2019
01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:39.560
what you're doing is it's so interesting because it's such a normal thing,

2020
01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:44.690
but in talking about it,
and especially you're a charismatic guy,

2021
01:59:44.691 --> 01:59:48.230
when you're on stage and talking about you're being yourself and you're,
you're,

2022
01:59:48.231 --> 01:59:51.080
you know,
you're having fun with it.
And when you're doing that,

2023
01:59:51.230 --> 01:59:54.530
it kind of gets everybody titillated and excited about it.

2024
01:59:54.531 --> 01:59:57.890
And then it spreads this movement and I guarantee this podcast is going to do

2025
01:59:57.891 --> 02:00:01.370
more of that too.
And it's also something that's really accessible.

2026
02:00:01.371 --> 02:00:04.800
Like when I talk about hunting,
people go,
yeah man,
but I can't fucking Mohan.

2027
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:08.180
I don't have a gun.
I can't get that horse.
That's a higher,
as a guide.

2028
02:00:08.181 --> 02:00:10.280
I'm going to move to Montana or something.
It's fucking,

2029
02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:12.890
and then you don't know what you're doing and want to shoot anybody.

2030
02:00:12.891 --> 02:00:17.810
You gotta learn gun safety and a hunter's safety courses,
vice president,

2031
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:22.700
your ex vice president,
fake.
She never quite got there.
But yeah,
yeah,

2032
02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:25.730
it's,
it's,
it's difficult to get your own meat,
but man,

2033
02:00:25.731 --> 02:00:29.510
growing their own food is pretty fucking accessible to a lot of people are more

2034
02:00:29.511 --> 02:00:30.590
accessible than you would.

2035
02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:35.230
<v 1>Thank.
And to me it's,
it's,
it's sexy as hell.
Yeah.
I say,
you know,</v>

2036
02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:39.160
somebody said,
oh,
somebody wrote me once.
I said,
you know,
I tell these guys,

2037
02:00:39.161 --> 02:00:42.640
I said,
because of the,
the guys,
I was a man.
Ron,
why,
why?

2038
02:00:42.641 --> 02:00:46.120
There's always these girls at your place,
man.
Why,
why you always have,
I'm like,

2039
02:00:46.121 --> 02:00:50.170
I told you guys,
if you plant flowers,
you get flowers.

2040
02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:54.220
You know what I'm saying?
So I'm like,
you better stop playing in this soil,

2041
02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:55.200
you know,
and they didn't listen.
I,

2042
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:58.340
I ain't doing that until they see the girls then.
It's a whole nother thing.
And,

2043
02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:03.430
and I,
I said some of this stuff,
somebody sent me a email,
oh,
Ron.
Ron said this,

2044
02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:07.590
this was a real sexist,
um,
remark.
And I said,
you know,
I said,

2045
02:01:07.610 --> 02:01:12.610
you want to know are true panty dropper is when you go to your garden and you

2046
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:18.400
pick some food and you cook a meal for a girl or guy.

2047
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:22.660
But because I asked that Bourbon in it,
oh,
that,
that's sexist.
Why is that sexist?

2048
02:01:22.661 --> 02:01:26.890
I mean,
it's like,
who wouldn't want,
I mean,
that's sexy as hell to me,
dude,

2049
02:01:27.010 --> 02:01:30.700
that you can go to your garden and fix a meal and,
and feed it to somebody.

2050
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:32.500
I mean,
come on,
that's win.
Went well.

2051
02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.900
<v 2>People love the call sexist.
Yeah.
You're not,</v>

2052
02:01:34.901 --> 02:01:39.010
you're not discriminating or diminishing women and is that way by saying that,

2053
02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:40.030
but did he just

2054
02:01:40.030 --> 02:01:41.500
<v 3>love bitching and complaining?</v>

2055
02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.830
<v 1>Tell me how you deal with that shit.
How do you deal with,</v>

2056
02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:48.640
with people thinking just because you're a public figure and you're entertainer,

2057
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:52.630
that you're out there and they can just,
they can just,
you know,

2058
02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:55.690
and they got your email,
that dress or your fucking Facebook or whatever it is,

2059
02:01:55.691 --> 02:01:58.630
and they can just say shit.
And they think it's cool because they're on Facebook,

2060
02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:01.500
they just want attention.
That's okay.
Is that,
you think that's what it is?

2061
02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:04.460
<v 3>Yeah.
A lot of it is,
and then they're,
they're short sided a lot of it.</v>

2062
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:06.080
And sometimes they have good points.
You know,

2063
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:08.590
sometimes people have points and you have to look at it from their perspective.

2064
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:10.280
Yeah.
I think they,
you know,

2065
02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.200
<v 1>it's hard to be that low on the ground though sometime.</v>

2066
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:18.250
<v 3>Yeah.
Joe,
the Cedar fucking respect.
Well,
you know,</v>

2067
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.691
it's,

2068
02:02:18.691 --> 02:02:22.340
it's hard to not be affected by things that people say about you because in real

2069
02:02:22.341 --> 02:02:25.580
life when someone says something to you,
it's a conflict,
you know?

2070
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.940
But there's no conflict.
There's no real conflict online.

2071
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:33.080
And that's the reason why they're able to do that with no recourse or rather a

2072
02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:36.650
no repercussions.
And also there's no social cues.

2073
02:02:36.651 --> 02:02:38.120
There's no interaction.

2074
02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:41.210
They're not in front of you calling you a sexist piece of shit.

2075
02:02:42.590 --> 02:02:46.280
Because if they were also,
you would get more than just the printed word.

2076
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:49.210
I know to get their personality you would get,
they'd be like,

2077
02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:52.160
oh you're fucked up.
I see what you got your own problems.

2078
02:02:52.161 --> 02:02:54.290
You need to worry about why you worried about me being sexist?

2079
02:02:54.291 --> 02:02:57.050
What I'm talking about vegetables being size head.
I've had,

2080
02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:00.130
<v 1>you know I've had a couple of interactions and some I said,
Oh Ron,</v>

2081
02:03:00.131 --> 02:03:01.530
I think you need a PR

2082
02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:05.500
<v 3>person.
She's fuck off.
You don't need a Goddamn PR person's,
I'll go,</v>

2083
02:03:06.450 --> 02:03:08.160
<v 1>don't check me and think thank you.</v>

2084
02:03:08.161 --> 02:03:11.790
Checking me just cause you don't know who the fuck you really don't know me.

2085
02:03:11.850 --> 02:03:14.820
You know at all.
You don't know what I stand for.
You don't know what I do.

2086
02:03:14.850 --> 02:03:18.660
This is a part of me that you but don't think you can just say some shit in and

2087
02:03:18.690 --> 02:03:23.690
like Kinda just kinda judge me and go at me and just cause you,

2088
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:26.030
you,
you online.
And it's like no.

2089
02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:29.040
And some occasion and I've bit my lip a lot man.

2090
02:03:29.041 --> 02:03:34.041
But it's like right now they make it real hard to do good.

2091
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:37.230
You know what I'm saying?
And this should be,
it shouldn't be.
No,

2092
02:03:37.231 --> 02:03:37.861
I'm not even gonna.

2093
02:03:37.861 --> 02:03:42.000
I'm just saying that just the system the way it is with a lot of this nonprofit

2094
02:03:42.001 --> 02:03:45.900
bullshit and this,
that's what it is.
Just that it's bullshit.
A lot of it,

2095
02:03:45.930 --> 02:03:48.120
a lot of his bullshit man.
And it's like,
are you,

2096
02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:52.650
are you guys really trying to change some shit or a Ron is this money comes with

2097
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:56.620
strings.
What a noose.
What kind of fucking string,
you know,

2098
02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:58.800
what are you talking about?
It comes with strings.
What are you,

2099
02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.620
are you trying to change this or what do to do just that's some bullshit.
Oh,

2100
02:04:02.621 --> 02:04:06.240
you got to shuffle papers and it's like,
and that's what I'm trying to,
I mean,

2101
02:04:06.241 --> 02:04:09.990
I'm trying to literally see change too.
And I mean it ain't,
no,

2102
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:12.920
it might be some eagles shit in there,
but when I do something,

2103
02:04:13.230 --> 02:04:18.120
I put my fucking foot in.
Dude,
I want to see some big massive,

2104
02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:22.090
ginormous type shit changed man.
And that's,
that's what,
that's what I'm the,

2105
02:04:22.091 --> 02:04:25.590
and it's like whoa.
And you getting to talk to these people and getting,

2106
02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.390
going to and trying to get money,
man.

2107
02:04:27.391 --> 02:04:31.080
And it's like you realize you guys ain't really trying to change shit.

2108
02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:35.910
<v 3>Well,
some people are and some people aren't in the real situation.</v>

2109
02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.070
You're dealing with this as the are staggering.

2110
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.170
<v 2>You know,
you're dealing with,
when you're online,</v>

2111
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.550
especially with your online like you are and you become a celebrity because of a

2112
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:45.960
cause that you support.

2113
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:51.230
You are a person who can be reached by other folks who agree or disagree and

2114
02:04:51.421 --> 02:04:54.770
just the sheer numbers you're dealing with people like you can't filter them
out.

2115
02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:55.591
You don't know them.

2116
02:04:55.591 --> 02:05:00.591
You can't meet all 100,000 people want to comment on your fucking youtube video.

2117
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:03.390
You can do it.
You don't have the time.
And if you did,

2118
02:05:03.391 --> 02:05:06.120
you wouldn't even get to know them anyway.
You get to know the,

2119
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:10.050
you know what they're putting out there and they're fucking most polished,

2120
02:05:10.051 --> 02:05:12.780
most prepared version of themselves.

2121
02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:14.730
You don't know whether or not they're really,

2122
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.520
they have their shit together enough to consider their opinion.

2123
02:05:17.550 --> 02:05:21.480
So you don't know when you're getting the printed word in someone's responding

2124
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:24.960
to you or insulting you or criticizing you in some sort of a way.

2125
02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:27.750
It's hard to deem whether or not it's valid or not.

2126
02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:30.710
So it takes a certain amount of personal sovereignty when you're putting,

2127
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:36.320
<v 1>you know,
I split it in me.</v>

2128
02:05:36.321 --> 02:05:39.740
I don't,
I mean,
if somebody said,
Ron,
you shouldn't read all this shit.

2129
02:05:39.741 --> 02:05:41.890
You shouldn't.
And I'm like,
I read it.
If it's there,
it's coming.

2130
02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:43.940
I'm reading everything.
It doesn't bother me.

2131
02:05:43.941 --> 02:05:46.190
There's certain shit that people could rate.
I mean,

2132
02:05:46.191 --> 02:05:49.040
I've been trying to bother you.
Oh No,
no,
there's Oh day.

2133
02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:52.490
And I tell him and I read that Shit and it does not bother me.

2134
02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.800
You know what I'm saying?
I know who the hell I am.

2135
02:05:54.801 --> 02:05:56.780
I have a code and that's what I live by.

2136
02:05:56.781 --> 02:06:01.490
I'm not living by your code of what you think should happen.
So I'm,
I'm,

2137
02:06:01.610 --> 02:06:05.630
I mean that kind of people like you shouldn't read those.
I'm like,
why not?
Yeah.

2138
02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:08.570
Why not?
Yeah,
no,
I,
as long as you're cool with it,
why not?
Yeah.

2139
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:12.320
<v 2>I always say that it's like snake venom.
If you get too much in one shot,</v>

2140
02:06:12.321 --> 02:06:14.490
you're going to die,
but if you have a little every day,

2141
02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:18.140
you know you become immune to it and I could read mean shit about me and I'm

2142
02:06:18.141 --> 02:06:21.230
like,
that's not true.
I know me,
I know me,

2143
02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:25.520
I know who I am and I slept with me last night.
People I was pretty damn good.

2144
02:06:25.610 --> 02:06:28.490
They also like the people that are criticizing you.

2145
02:06:28.491 --> 02:06:31.400
Do you turn that high powered perspective,

2146
02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:35.780
the introspective like analysis?

2147
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:37.280
Do you turn it on yourself?

2148
02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:40.850
Do you do you do judge yourself the way you're judging other people?

2149
02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.860
Most likely not.
And if you did,

2150
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:46.100
you'd probably shut the fuck up because you have plenty of things in your own

2151
02:06:46.101 --> 02:06:50.440
backyard to clean up before you go after other people like Kim Kardashian or

2152
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:52.970
these fucking people you're,
you're getting upset about online.

2153
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.540
Go to any video online and read the comments on Youtube.

2154
02:06:57.170 --> 02:07:02.170
99.9% of those motherfuckers leaving comments she had just get away from the

2155
02:07:02.421 --> 02:07:06.170
computer,
get their fucking life in order.
Like you're,
you're missing,

2156
02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:08.930
you're putting all this effort and energy and it's someone you don't even

2157
02:07:08.931 --> 02:07:09.800
fucking know.

2158
02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:14.270
Trying to make them feel bad because you feel bad that they're rich and famous

2159
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.370
and dating Kanye West or whatever it is.

2160
02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:18.040
<v 1>I had,</v>

2161
02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:23.040
I had somebody say something cause I used to post pictures of 'em and I still

2162
02:07:24.371 --> 02:07:28.630
do.
If I see one of people with tattoos,
I don't have no tattoos and you know,

2163
02:07:28.631 --> 02:07:31.300
but I still appreciate the art of it.

2164
02:07:31.301 --> 02:07:35.830
And the beauty of it in the fact that somebody did this in the,
the of that shit.

2165
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:41.020
And I would pells tattoos and some woman,
you know,
pick me up and says,

2166
02:07:41.110 --> 02:07:44.620
oh,
I was surprised to wake up this morning and find this on your feet.

2167
02:07:44.650 --> 02:07:49.650
You being a progressive fucks that I'm a progressive and I don't,

2168
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:54.580
what do you see here?
A woman in a bikini with tattoos and what did I see?
Art.

2169
02:07:55.210 --> 02:07:57.460
I see art and beauty here,
but she,
you know,

2170
02:07:57.461 --> 02:08:00.580
the fact that somebody thinks that they,
like you said,
it's like,
Oh hey,

2171
02:08:00.581 --> 02:08:04.990
I got a tight right.
I can see the computer,
I can do this shit.
So you do have to,

2172
02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:06.670
you know some,
okay.
Yeah.

2173
02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:11.230
<v 2>Well people love to categorize like I'm a conservative,
I'm a liberal.</v>

2174
02:08:11.231 --> 02:08:12.910
I'm a in the end,
if you don't,
you know,

2175
02:08:12.911 --> 02:08:16.300
you have this rigid ideology that falls into that.
Oh you're a progressive.

2176
02:08:16.301 --> 02:08:20.720
But yet you like girls.
Like what the fuck is that have to do anything?

2177
02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.180
How about these girls?

2178
02:08:22.181 --> 02:08:26.020
It's their choice whether or not they want to take photos with bikinis cause

2179
02:08:26.021 --> 02:08:28.930
they liked the way their body looks.
And there's not,
it's not bad.

2180
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:32.630
What people don't like is the way it makes them feel about their body.

2181
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:38.500
We see a woman who's got this fucking bang and body and she's got a beautiful

2182
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:43.160
tattoo on her back.
She's sticking her ass out.
Whoa.
Sexism.
Oh No,
she's all right.

2183
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.790
She wants to do it.
She wants you to see that ass.
Cause she know she likes it.

2184
02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:52.480
You know?
Oh,
exploiting women.
How about she's exploiting you?
Stupid.

2185
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:57.730
How about that?
She's got a fucking great hand of cards.
That genetics delta,

2186
02:08:57.910 --> 02:09:02.690
she went to the gym every day.
Look at that ass.
Oh,
you know.
Oh,

2187
02:09:02.730 --> 02:09:07.240
it's a sexy.
No,
you're fast.
You don't like you're fat.
You don't like that.

2188
02:09:07.241 --> 02:09:09.550
It makes you feel like shit when you look at someone that works.

2189
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:14.080
I didn't call you fat Joe,
coach.
Some people are fat.
It's a damn fact.

2190
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:15.400
You can't get away from it.

2191
02:09:16.050 --> 02:09:18.640
And the San people that will think that you're egotistical because he'd go to

2192
02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:21.490
the gym.
Uh,
well how about you Ken?

2193
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.940
And it makes your body look better and feel better.
And people,

2194
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:27.910
people are more attracted to you.
That makes sex better.

2195
02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:33.130
Nobody wants to say that.
No.
Sex is about I love.
Yeah.
Guess what?

2196
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:38.200
Love when you're more attractive is better.
No doubt it is.
It's this better.

2197
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.240
If someone has a good body,

2198
02:09:40.241 --> 02:09:45.241
there's a reason why they use women's bodies to sell cars and fucking shampoo

2199
02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:47.560
and everything.
It's because we're attracted to it.

2200
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.180
And if your body is overflowing with neglect and fucking,

2201
02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:55.690
and you're,
your fat rolls are pouring over the side of your underwear,

2202
02:09:55.691 --> 02:09:59.150
that's not as attractive.
Some people fucking shit sexy though.

2203
02:09:59.830 --> 02:10:01.450
Some people to find that shit.
Sec.

2204
02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:05.130
People like ugly feet turn off from ugly feet.

2205
02:10:05.150 --> 02:10:10.030
Necrophilia you're right.
I'm being closed minded.
Yeah,
you are.

2206
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:14.180
I'm a,
that's a little,
a little,
a little judgmental.
I'm very judgmental.

2207
02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:18.990
So I do for a living.
I just shit people say don't judge.
If he didn't judge what,

2208
02:10:18.991 --> 02:10:22.220
I never get anything done.
You would be fucking hit by cars every day.

2209
02:10:22.221 --> 02:10:26.500
You'd never judged where the cars are coming.
We were retarded.
Don't judge.

2210
02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:30.340
But that's how we got to here and fucking 15 okay.
That's how we got,

2211
02:10:30.370 --> 02:10:34.070
we've been judging shit or figuring out what's good and bad.
You know,

2212
02:10:35.650 --> 02:10:38.690
it's don't judge.
No judge.

2213
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:42.570
People don't like the people don't like the fact that there's this abroad

2214
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.570
fucking range of human beings in this life.
And some people got lucky as shit,

2215
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:50.560
you know?
And some people like just athletically.
Yeah.

2216
02:10:51.250 --> 02:10:54.290
There's people that no matter what the fuck they do,

2217
02:10:54.291 --> 02:10:56.900
they'll never be Coby Bryant.
It's impossible.

2218
02:10:57.110 --> 02:11:01.340
He got a way better genetic roll the dice and you period,
end of discussion,

2219
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:04.220
move on with your life.
Maybe there's some shit.
Your baby,

2220
02:11:04.221 --> 02:11:06.800
you're a better singer than Cobie.
Maybe you tell better jokes.

2221
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:09.860
Maybe you could write a better book.
Maybe you're better at eating pussy,

2222
02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.690
but whatever it is,
whatever it is,
you can't shoot a jumper like that's his.

2223
02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:19.760
He got that.
Sorry.
It is what it is.
Your nose is bigger than Mariah Carey's.

2224
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:24.410
You got to deal with that.
This is the hand that you're given and you know,

2225
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:30.650
but people don't want that.
So they go,
oh,
look at you sexist.

2226
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:33.880
I thought you were progressive.
These photos of women,
what?

2227
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:38.540
I didn't need the progress.
It's a new new label.
People love labels.

2228
02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:42.800
They love being a part of groups.
They look,
I mean the new one is social justice.

2229
02:11:42.801 --> 02:11:44.840
Why the fuck did I get put in that group?
Well,

2230
02:11:44.841 --> 02:11:48.030
because you're a guy who was teaching people how to grow vegetables.
Oh,

2231
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:52.250
that makes that sort of aggressive progress.
Isn't that going backwards though,

2232
02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.380
isn't that you're right in a way,

2233
02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.100
but it's progressing away from the direction that we're at now,

2234
02:11:58.101 --> 02:11:58.940
which is negative,

2235
02:11:58.941 --> 02:12:03.941
which is factory farming and factory agriculture and all this fucking bullshit

2236
02:12:04.641 --> 02:12:06.950
with the meeting antibiotics.

2237
02:12:06.951 --> 02:12:11.750
That's negative three education progress is moving away from the chemicals that

2238
02:12:11.751 --> 02:12:13.940
had been put into our foods for greed and profit.

2239
02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:15.410
So that makes you a progressive.

2240
02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:19.820
Also anybody that is against racism,

2241
02:12:19.821 --> 02:12:24.821
anybody that is against a government monopolies and corporate control of our

2242
02:12:25.011 --> 02:12:29.300
media,
that's progressive as well.
It's just,
there's just labels.

2243
02:12:29.301 --> 02:12:30.290
People love labels.

2244
02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.650
<v 1>Wow.
So,
okay.</v>

2245
02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:39.510
So does it make me a progressive that I'm tired of him shooting these black kids

2246
02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:44.130
and getting away with it?
That shit's progressive.
Progressive,
very progressive.

2247
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:45.850
Well,
I think that,
um,

2248
02:12:46.410 --> 02:12:47.550
<v 2>what we're seeing today,</v>

2249
02:12:47.551 --> 02:12:52.050
and this is a really interesting time when it comes to accountability for crimes

2250
02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:54.270
that,
especially with the police,

2251
02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:59.540
there have been more articles in the past year that I've written that I've read

2252
02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.860
and that I've seen online and more videos and more protests about police

2253
02:13:04.861 --> 02:13:07.770
brutality than ever before.
And then finally,
what's the response?

2254
02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:12.840
La just paid for 7,000 body cameras that cops are all going to be forced to
wear.

2255
02:13:12.841 --> 02:13:15.210
No,
that is accountability.

2256
02:13:15.211 --> 02:13:18.600
And that is a direct response to people being outraged and that's progress.

2257
02:13:18.601 --> 02:13:20.460
And that is a,
that's being a progressive,

2258
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:25.440
<v 1>oh,
it's somewhere they got some cop,
I forgot where it was,
Texas,</v>

2259
02:13:25.441 --> 02:13:30.280
somewhere where he would just,
he would,
um,
just arm what you call it,

2260
02:13:30.281 --> 02:13:32.160
disarm is his body camera and do

2261
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:35.820
<v 2>some foul shit.
You know,
they kind of beating up some girl.
He should go to jail.</v>

2262
02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:38.700
They should be a mandatory like 20 year prison sentence for a cop.

2263
02:13:38.701 --> 02:13:41.220
That disarms is fucking camera on purpose to do something like that.

2264
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:42.263
Like you are,

2265
02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:45.810
you're committing a crime and you're abusing your position of power and you're

2266
02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:48.720
doing something that is absolutely not what you're supposed to be doing.

2267
02:13:48.721 --> 02:13:50.820
What he's supposed to be upholding,
protecting,

2268
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:54.300
serve and protect does not mean take your fucking cameras,
shut it off of,

2269
02:13:54.301 --> 02:13:56.590
beat the shit out of somebody because it's illegal there.
No.

2270
02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.940
Well how about that fucking guy that was in Denver that was beating the shit out

2271
02:13:59.941 --> 02:14:02.310
of this guy?
That was on the ground,
punched him in the face.

2272
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:04.560
They saw a guy with a camera that was filming it.

2273
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:08.820
They take the guy's camera away from him,
delete the pig,
the video arrest him.

2274
02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.760
But he had already sent it up to the cloud.
Right?

2275
02:14:11.130 --> 02:14:14.190
And so then he released it online and now everybody's like,
well,

2276
02:14:14.191 --> 02:14:16.950
we're all about accountability,
right?
We're all about transparency.

2277
02:14:17.370 --> 02:14:20.520
Fuck you are the fuck you are.
That guy knocked over,

2278
02:14:20.521 --> 02:14:23.940
a pregnant lady was punching some poor immigrant dude in the face.

2279
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:26.790
You know that happened?
Yeah.
The guy was selling a little drugs.

2280
02:14:26.791 --> 02:14:27.421
Why is he doing that?

2281
02:14:27.421 --> 02:14:31.620
He's broke and poor and there's a bad situation and if you lived his life,

2282
02:14:31.621 --> 02:14:34.080
you'd probably be doing the exactly the same shit he's doing.

2283
02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:38.940
<v 1>It's in,
it's in.
It's so easy to do.
I mean,
and like I said earlier,
where it is,</v>

2284
02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:42.860
<v 2>the drugs come from.
How the fuck did they get here?
Yeah.
What I'm saying?
Yeah,</v>

2285
02:14:42.861 --> 02:14:46.100
I'm in.
The reason,
the number one reason why they're sold,

2286
02:14:46.101 --> 02:14:48.830
the way they're being sold right now is because the factory illegal.

2287
02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.030
That's why if you look at Portugal's decriminalization of all drugs and you look

2288
02:14:53.031 --> 02:14:54.800
at the amount of people that have died,

2289
02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.290
the amount of crimes that have been committed that a drug related,

2290
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:59.990
there's a graph that that was put up online a couple of days ago,

2291
02:14:59.991 --> 02:15:04.580
that it's a fucking huge dip,
a huge dip and drug related violence,

2292
02:15:04.581 --> 02:15:09.230
a huge dip and all sorts of shit that's connected to illegal activities.

2293
02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.860
When you have illegal activities,
look,

2294
02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.220
alcohol in this country is a huge problem for sure,
for sure,
but you know,

2295
02:15:16.221 --> 02:15:17.240
it's not a huge problem.

2296
02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:21.530
Alcohol companies shooting other alcohol companies because they're stealing

2297
02:15:21.531 --> 02:15:24.080
their profits because the fact that it's legal,

2298
02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:27.200
you don't have that gang on gang violence that you're having done in fucking

2299
02:15:27.201 --> 02:15:30.860
Mexico.
That shit is directly connected to the illegality.

2300
02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:35.800
<v 1>Do you want all these motherfuckers on the street?
Hi.
I don't want him drunk.</v>

2301
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:38.260
Yeah,
how about that?
I don't want them driving drunk.

2302
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:40.080
We got drunk and I would want

2303
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:44.430
<v 2>way rather have people driving around on marijuana than driving</v>

2304
02:15:44.630 --> 02:15:47.540
<v 1>around on alchemy and of course go to Texas.</v>

2305
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:51.460
But I didn't like though when I'm not Texas.
I mean Denver,
when I wasn't,

2306
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:54.170
when I was in Colorado.
What,
what wasn't cool?

2307
02:15:54.171 --> 02:15:57.320
They were just smoking in the street and somebody whose kid is right here.

2308
02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:59.210
I didn't,
I'm not cool with that.

2309
02:15:59.870 --> 02:16:03.950
Literally booked me in a bud and breakfast hotel dude.

2310
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:08.360
But I've never been high a day in my life.
You know what I'm saying?
And I'm like,

2311
02:16:08.361 --> 02:16:12.200
what?
Why did they book you in that?
Then I then maybe they got a special rate.

2312
02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:15.890
I have no idea.
You know,
I don't know what the hell that was,
but it was like,

2313
02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:20.600
you know,
he just assumed you get high,
you got to cool.
Most people do.

2314
02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:23.630
But that's probably what it,
maybe you would be even cool if you've got hot,

2315
02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:28.700
not a day in your life.
I mean,
look,
I never a couple of,

2316
02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:30.053
I'm never

2317
02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:32.110
<v 2>that I find to be</v>

2318
02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:35.850
<v 1>that Joe,
some comedian did this joke about him.
What?</v>

2319
02:16:35.851 --> 02:16:39.970
He says I'm gay.
I couldn't imagine I'm not gay,
you know,

2320
02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:43.710
suck another man's Dick.
And he says,
what?
Well just that once,

2321
02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.730
cause I needed a ride

2322
02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:48.780
<v 2>ride home.
I got to do what you gotta do.</v>

2323
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:52.340
That's what I did.
You're selling drugs.
I've never had a cup of coffee,
dude.

2324
02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:56.190
Have her in my life is awesome.
I had so I hear,
you know,

2325
02:16:57.270 --> 02:17:01.140
don't ask me why gets you.
Well look,
there's not,
you don't have to,

2326
02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:04.350
obviously you turned out great.
You don't need any of these things.

2327
02:17:04.351 --> 02:17:08.220
You don't need alcohol,
you don't need drugs.
You don't need any of those things.

2328
02:17:08.250 --> 02:17:08.430
Okay,

2329
02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:12.780
well my point is that they exist and some people find them beneficial and grown

2330
02:17:12.781 --> 02:17:15.930
adult should be able to do what ever the fuck they want.
I enjoy a cup of coffee.

2331
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:19.610
If coffee was made illegal,
I would be fucking furious.
Like,
yeah,

2332
02:17:19.611 --> 02:17:24.540
if like some asshole decided that coffee is somehow or another causing people to

2333
02:17:24.541 --> 02:17:29.541
be too tense or be more productive or whatever the fucking reason they decide to

2334
02:17:29.941 --> 02:17:30.774
make it illegal,

2335
02:17:30.810 --> 02:17:34.500
that's a grown adult telling another grown adult what they can do with their

2336
02:17:34.501 --> 02:17:37.610
life that doesn't affect anybody else other than that.
So yeah,
it's bullshit.

2337
02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:42.300
You're one of those coffee lead people that have to have the certain brand type

2338
02:17:42.301 --> 02:17:45.400
shit and no,
no.
I go to Starbucks all the time.
Oh God.

2339
02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.840
Go to fucking Dunkin donuts.
They're shitty coffee.
I like coffee,

2340
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:52.290
but I like good coffee.
It's like anything good.
Coffee's better.

2341
02:17:52.470 --> 02:17:56.190
And my friend owns caveman coffee,
which is a single source coffee company,

2342
02:17:56.191 --> 02:17:59.760
has a direct relationship with his farm in South America.
They grow the coffee,

2343
02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:03.180
he gets the coffee,
they bring it back to America,
they roast it.
It's like,

2344
02:18:03.181 --> 02:18:04.590
you know exactly where it came from.

2345
02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:08.160
He has a direct relationship with the farmers.
That to me is beautiful.

2346
02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.710
That to me,
you know,
going,
you go down to Central America,

2347
02:18:10.711 --> 02:18:13.800
you get the fucking coffee.
Yeah.
You know,
you know where it comes from.

2348
02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.910
I like all that.
I like that.
You know,

2349
02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:18.240
it's very difficult to grow coffee in America.

2350
02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:20.430
And in fact there's a place in Santa Barbara,

2351
02:18:20.431 --> 02:18:23.940
I think he's one of the few places in America that's grown coffee.

2352
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:28.350
It's not that easy to grow it in America.
You need a very particular climate.

2353
02:18:28.590 --> 02:18:31.770
You know,
I,
one of the things I found out,
I had a guy on who was a,

2354
02:18:31.771 --> 02:18:36.120
a coffee expert who told me that all coffee is actually from Ethiopia.

2355
02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:40.830
All of it.
Every original originally from Ethiopia and all this coffee.

2356
02:18:40.831 --> 02:18:42.900
Do you have like Colombian grown and all that shit?

2357
02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:45.840
It's not supposed to be in Columbia.
They brought it over,

2358
02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:49.020
they brought it like Arabian coffee,
Arabica beans.

2359
02:18:49.050 --> 02:18:52.590
All that shit came from Ethiopia and they brought it to Saudi Arabia or wherever

2360
02:18:52.591 --> 02:18:54.880
the fuck they're growing it,
all of it comes from me field.

2361
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:59.320
<v 1>Well that's one of the things with me with um,
native plants.
You know,</v>

2362
02:18:59.321 --> 02:19:02.950
it's some of that to me is some bullshit native when,
when was it Nate,

2363
02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:06.660
when you know,
and that's this big thing.
We're only plant native plants here.

2364
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:11.850
Native when wait year food,
who said it was Nate when the dinosaurs were here?

2365
02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:15.210
How,
you know what I'm saying?
What the fuck was it native to you dude?

2366
02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:19.350
And you got these scholars and they preach this and it's like native when I

2367
02:19:19.351 --> 02:19:21.500
won't give me a date.
Right,
right,
right.

2368
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:24.230
<v 2>Well,
there was an episode of Radio Lab,</v>

2369
02:19:24.231 --> 02:19:26.630
which is a great podcast on the Galapagos Islands.

2370
02:19:26.631 --> 02:19:30.590
And I was talking how there's all these invasive plant species that come from

2371
02:19:30.591 --> 02:19:32.780
literally dude's walking somewhere else,

2372
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:36.470
having something on their shoe and then walking into this new place and then

2373
02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:40.640
these plants grow.
It's a native now it's native down.
Yeah,
right,

2374
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:44.450
exactly right.
And that crazy.
That is crazy.

2375
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:48.590
It is crazy how we like that native and way we do it with humans.

2376
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:52.460
That's where it gets really weird.
Like if you're over there like especially my,

2377
02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:55.520
what?
I was tripped out,
I talk about this when I go to San Diego all the time,

2378
02:19:55.521 --> 02:19:56.870
cause I love San Diego.

2379
02:19:57.020 --> 02:20:00.480
But one of the weird things about San Diego is it's right now he's still a t o

2380
02:20:00.481 --> 02:20:03.920
Mana and those fucking people,
they can come over for a little bit,

2381
02:20:03.921 --> 02:20:05.780
but you get better,
get back over and your fucking side.

2382
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.690
Like they'll let people come over.
I'll go,
let me take the papers,

2383
02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:11.240
check your papers.
Okay.
All right.
You know,

2384
02:20:11.241 --> 02:20:14.600
you're only over here for a few hours and get back over that fucking line.

2385
02:20:14.970 --> 02:20:16.980
I think there's a line for human.

2386
02:20:16.981 --> 02:20:21.981
It was literally aligns that crazy guy with a gun standing to making sure many

2387
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:25.790
guys,
many guys with trucks.

2388
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000
The fucking trippy thing about San Diego is they got you drive like 40 minutes

2389
02:20:31.071 --> 02:20:32.330
outside of San Diego.

2390
02:20:32.331 --> 02:20:36.560
They got another line to try to catch you just in case you're hiking someone's

2391
02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:38.480
trunk.
It's fucking nuts,

2392
02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.920
<v 1>man.
No,
I,
it was that sign.</v>

2393
02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:45.650
Do you notice sign has got the family and the little kid is dangling behind

2394
02:20:45.651 --> 02:20:49.490
everybody's running.
I'm like,
that's just look so racist,
dark,

2395
02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:51.113
<v 2>dark.</v>

2396
02:20:51.210 --> 02:20:54.120
The fact that you got to be careful that families are trying to come over here

2397
02:20:54.121 --> 02:20:56.910
for better life and that's why they're coming over here.

2398
02:20:56.911 --> 02:20:59.880
They're not coming over here to rape dogs or fucking

2399
02:21:00.210 --> 02:21:04.710
<v 1>being in Mexico too though it it let me know that a lot of that shit seems like</v>

2400
02:21:04.711 --> 02:21:07.860
propaganda because when I was in Mexico,

2401
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:10.270
it's like Guadalajara and places,
man,

2402
02:21:10.290 --> 02:21:14.250
these people are like not even thinking about coming to the states.
I mean,

2403
02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:19.320
come on,
man.
They're like,
it's nice we kick in it or eight restaurants.

2404
02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:20.880
Great Nightlife.
Yes,

2405
02:21:20.881 --> 02:21:25.560
but they have the thinking that this whole country wants to come to United

2406
02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:27.360
States.
That's the propaganda bullshit that we get.

2407
02:21:27.361 --> 02:21:31.590
Like the whole country is lined up waiting and they're not.
Man,

2408
02:21:31.591 --> 02:21:34.080
there's people just having shit over there and you know what the,

2409
02:21:34.081 --> 02:21:37.980
one of the weirdest things about Mexico is is the border towns that are the most

2410
02:21:37.981 --> 02:21:41.130
fucked up.
Yeah.
That's so strange.
I got a friend,

2411
02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.700
I got a friend painting right now in Juarez.
That's a bad spot.

2412
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:47.670
I am on my own Mac.
I heard he was in the Walrus.

2413
02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:52.350
That's a scary spot because the weird thing is you cross war as and it's fine

2414
02:21:52.410 --> 02:21:53.400
and America is fine.

2415
02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:56.810
<v 2>San Antonio is nice.
You know this about what?
I don't know.</v>

2416
02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:02.060
That's not good though.
That's weird.
It's weird.
Tiawana there's another one.

2417
02:22:02.061 --> 02:22:04.460
I mean Tiwan is not as bad as everybody thinks it is,

2418
02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:07.400
but every now and then they'll cut a bunch of people's heads off and leave them

2419
02:22:07.401 --> 02:22:10.640
in fucking garbage bags when he notes tied to him and shit.
I mean,

2420
02:22:10.641 --> 02:22:13.610
they will do that.
I mean,

2421
02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:18.490
so far it's fucked up.
It's fucked up.
Yeah.
I mean,

2422
02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:22.610
that drug violence is fucked up,
but that shit didn't happen when we were kids.

2423
02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:26.340
Right.
That shit is all within the last 20 years.

2424
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:27.690
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

2425
02:22:27.691 --> 02:22:31.740
I went to Mexico without a second thought in,

2426
02:22:31.770 --> 02:22:35.970
I think it was like 2004 or something like that.
I went on vacation there.

2427
02:22:36.050 --> 02:22:40.050
It didn't worry at all.
But in 2014,
10 years later,
it's like,
whoa.

2428
02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:45.840
No.
We were in,
um,
uh,
teach an Eatsa,
went down to see the,
the,

2429
02:22:45.841 --> 02:22:49.920
the,
uh,
Mayan Pyramids.
Amazing.
That's a trippy shit.

2430
02:22:49.921 --> 02:22:52.260
But it is now people,
you know,

2431
02:22:52.261 --> 02:22:54.960
you talked to people about going to Mexico and they're like,
fuck that.

2432
02:22:54.961 --> 02:22:59.040
I'm not going down.
They're fucked up.
It's,
I mean,

2433
02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:02.090
I think a head cutting.
We'll do that to you though,
Joe.
Well,

2434
02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:03.720
how about Chicago's gang violence?

2435
02:23:03.721 --> 02:23:08.010
I mean it's more people die in Chicago every year then a lot of these cities in

2436
02:23:08.011 --> 02:23:10.050
Mexico and we don't think about that.

2437
02:23:10.051 --> 02:23:13.890
When we traveled to Chicago and everybody just goes to food is so fucking good

2438
02:23:13.891 --> 02:23:17.700
and kind of town and not think about Sinatra songs

2439
02:23:18.210 --> 02:23:21.670
<v 1>call.
I was in Chicago and somebody like Ron,
if we need your help,
we,</v>

2440
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:25.820
it was one guy,
I think he owns 60 lots and it,

2441
02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:30.540
it looked like some de militarize.
It looked like some war zones.
Such shit man.

2442
02:23:30.541 --> 02:23:34.170
It's like,
and they're like,
we want,
we need to plant food,
we need to,

2443
02:23:34.290 --> 02:23:39.120
and I'm like end to see that somebody owns 60 lots and this is normal.

2444
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:42.030
That wasn't like he was some special guy.
How is,

2445
02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:45.360
it's kind kinda crazy in Chicago man,
that that is happening like that.

2446
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:49.030
<v 3>Yeah.
Well there's some crazy spots in this country for sure.
I mean Detroit,</v>

2447
02:23:49.090 --> 02:23:52.990
I spent some time in Detroit last year that trip me out when you buy a house for

2448
02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.970
500 bucks.
Yeah.
You know,

2449
02:23:54.971 --> 02:23:59.260
in Detroit is starting to slowly bounced back from that to where people are

2450
02:23:59.261 --> 02:24:00.094
starting to.

2451
02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.840
People are starting to them start businesses and she's starting to expand and

2452
02:24:04.841 --> 02:24:08.330
starting to make use of the land.
A lot of the artists are going out there to,

2453
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:11.470
you know,
it was,
I guess,
I guess it's like the new wild west out there.

2454
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:13.690
Well in a lot of ways,
I mean the,

2455
02:24:13.691 --> 02:24:17.880
the nature has sort of reabsorbed a lot of the buildings.
Like there's,

2456
02:24:17.890 --> 02:24:21.520
there were some uh,
nature does that shit.
Fuck yeah,
it does really quick,

2457
02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:24.160
really quick.
She don't play,

2458
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:28.240
nature doesn't give a fuck about your rent and your zoning.
Nothing.

2459
02:24:28.390 --> 02:24:31.570
But there was a website that had all these homes in Detroit that are being

2460
02:24:31.571 --> 02:24:35.320
reclaimed by trees,
like trees growing through the center of the floor boards.

2461
02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:38.110
He's building,
like there were some holes in this,
in the ceiling,

2462
02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:42.540
which is enough to let rain and light through a seed got somehow or another end

2463
02:24:42.541 --> 02:24:45.260
of the ground and it's grown through the fucking floor boards.

2464
02:24:45.261 --> 02:24:46.780
There's a tree in the middle of a house.

2465
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:50.670
That house won't be there in a hundred years.
It'd be a fucking tree,
you know,

2466
02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:51.130
and it'll,

2467
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:55.700
all the boards will rot away and the tree will absorb the,

2468
02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.930
the,
the,
the nutrients from the rotten wood.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2469
02:24:58.931 --> 02:25:01.010
It'll be like compost for this tree.
No

2470
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:05.720
<v 1>doubt.
And that's,
that's it's a Ma.
And I tell people,
you know,
nature always wins.</v>

2471
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:09.260
Always ask.
Those people were in palm pay if you can find them,
you know,

2472
02:25:09.261 --> 02:25:14.020
nature nature had no play in nature does not play.

2473
02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:18.770
And we in the,
and I think that's what we need to hear that call.

2474
02:25:18.771 --> 02:25:22.940
Cause the way we fucking up this planet because it's,
it's,
it's a thing where,

2475
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:28.780
um,
we have history to see what nature is like,
okay,

2476
02:25:28.781 --> 02:25:30.340
you guys are done.
You know,

2477
02:25:30.341 --> 02:25:33.670
it's like you can't keep just screwing this up and think it's going to be cool.

2478
02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:37.590
You know,
we,
it's like they had a,
it was it.
Sure.

2479
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:41.710
Novo or one of those other nuclear places where they did a show,

2480
02:25:41.711 --> 02:25:43.350
I think it was 60 minutes or something.

2481
02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:46.090
They went to visit one of these places and it's,

2482
02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:47.830
the radiation is still off the hook.

2483
02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:51.580
They'll be forever where people cannot live in this.
It's just like,

2484
02:25:51.581 --> 02:25:55.240
this stuff is frozen in time to turnover.

2485
02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:56.440
I know exactly what you're talking to me.

2486
02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:58.940
And then they said what they said in the nuclear actor,

2487
02:25:58.941 --> 02:26:03.100
there's actually like mushrooms and shit growing up.
Yeah.
I wouldn't eat one.

2488
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:06.880
Right.
You probably know if somebody told you true,

2489
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:13.880
<v 3>oh,
you'd be all over that.
She gave me on the next plane to turnover.
I would,
uh,</v>

2490
02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:17.640
let somebody else eat it first.
Now we're closely monitor them for a few years.

2491
02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:21.720
I want to make sure there's not some sort of an incubation period.

2492
02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.280
Eat that mushroom and six months later you become one.
Like,

2493
02:26:26.281 --> 02:26:27.540
have you ever seen those mushrooms?

2494
02:26:27.541 --> 02:26:32.460
Like there's a strain of quadriceps mushrooms that affects ants where it grows

2495
02:26:32.461 --> 02:26:33.300
inside.
The ant,

2496
02:26:33.301 --> 02:26:38.301
kills the ant and then it literally explodes and spray spores all throughout the

2497
02:26:39.481 --> 02:26:42.690
colony infecting all the all ads.
So these ants,

2498
02:26:42.691 --> 02:26:45.870
when they find out one of the mushroom or one of the mushrooms has got ahold of

2499
02:26:45.871 --> 02:26:48.540
one of the aunts and killed it.
They take the ant deep,
deep,

2500
02:26:48.541 --> 02:26:51.600
deep into the woods and drop his body off and get the fuck out of dodge.

2501
02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:54.380
Like they have a bomb.
They have to get away from it.

2502
02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:59.790
It's almost like instinctively nature has let them know that there's a certain

2503
02:26:59.791 --> 02:27:01.020
amount of time.
Yeah,
this is,

2504
02:27:01.021 --> 02:27:05.670
these is ants that are growing these mushrooms out of their bottom on Matt Stop.

2505
02:27:05.730 --> 02:27:06.570
Oh,
it's a trip dude.

2506
02:27:06.810 --> 02:27:11.250
And that mushroom that grows out of the body will explode and the spores will

2507
02:27:11.251 --> 02:27:12.600
spray into the air.

2508
02:27:12.601 --> 02:27:17.601
And in fact all their shoes and tha tha tha aunt like soy or,

2509
02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:19.650
exactly,
exactly.

2510
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:24.710
And they're using it as a base to launch all of their soldiers that are gonna

2511
02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:29.310
affect all the other aunts was crazy.
Dual nature.
So crazy.

2512
02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:34.340
There's so many examples of them using like other bodies as a host to spread.

2513
02:27:34.621 --> 02:27:38.820
I mean,
it's like you learn or die and that's what it's telling those ants.

2514
02:27:38.821 --> 02:27:41.400
You better figure out how to get this funding body and drop it off in the woods.

2515
02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:45.450
<v 1>That's how do it.
If I like an ant attacks on animal,
uh,</v>

2516
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:49.620
or or bug in another insect,
how do these group,
no.
Okay go dude.

2517
02:27:49.621 --> 02:27:51.440
You get the right.
I get the left.
I'm going to get the,

2518
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:54.080
I'm going to get that head.
And how do they know that?
We

2519
02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:56.630
<v 3>don't know.
We don't know how they know,
but we do know.
They do know.</v>

2520
02:27:56.810 --> 02:27:59.810
Do you know that ants,
takedown elephants?
I didn't know that.

2521
02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.650
They climb up the elephant's leg and start eating their fucking brain from their

2522
02:28:03.651 --> 02:28:04.220
ear.

2523
02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:08.330
They climb into their ear and they let somehow or another let all the other ants

2524
02:28:08.331 --> 02:28:10.940
through pheromones or,
or whatever signals they send.

2525
02:28:11.090 --> 02:28:14.660
They let all the other ants know,
hey,
we got some food here we go.

2526
02:28:14.810 --> 02:28:19.160
And they will climb up the fucking elephant into its ear and start eating the

2527
02:28:19.161 --> 02:28:21.770
elephant all alive from the ear

2528
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.790
<v 2>brain first.
Fuck.
That's kind of,</v>

2529
02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:30.460
that's kind of a little tiny thing cause nipping away slowly at an elephant guns

2530
02:28:30.470 --> 02:28:33.470
all day.
We don't,
we got time.
That's the thing about it.

2531
02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:36.800
My friend Brian wanted to be a biologist at one point in time.

2532
02:28:36.801 --> 02:28:41.390
He wanted to work with insects and he was in I think new Guinea or some,

2533
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:42.980
some jungle.
They had a,

2534
02:28:43.250 --> 02:28:47.360
they have these tents that they would have to place on platforms above the

2535
02:28:47.361 --> 02:28:52.340
ground and then they would put Turpentine on the street on the posts to keep the

2536
02:28:52.341 --> 02:28:55.790
ants from climbing up because once they find you,

2537
02:28:56.510 --> 02:29:00.350
they fuck you up.
Bio Mass of ants,

2538
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:02.570
the biomass of ants on this planet,

2539
02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:07.370
like the amount of weight of ants is the same roughly as the amount of weight of

2540
02:29:07.371 --> 02:29:11.810
people.
Yeah,
that's true.
It's true.

2541
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:15.500
That's somebody fucking ants.
There are,
that's crazy.
That's crazy.

2542
02:29:15.501 --> 02:29:19.600
7 billion people.
At least a hundred pounds.
Right.

2543
02:29:19.690 --> 02:29:24.460
<v 1>Did you see that documentary on ants?
Um,
where they hit this guy hit,</v>

2544
02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:27.890
he wants to see how big the colony was.
Oh,
I did see that.

2545
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:31.780
He poured the concrete in and then they pour some more concrete here and then

2546
02:29:31.781 --> 02:29:34.420
they push them.
Then they got to kind of keep to concrete truck.

2547
02:29:34.690 --> 02:29:38.020
Then they got another concrete truck and it should just kept taking them all the

2548
02:29:38.021 --> 02:29:41.800
concrete.
And I think it was a square mile or some crazy shit.
And they dug it up.

2549
02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:43.070
And this was this aunt

2550
02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:48.140
<v 2>there,
whatever the hell they call them,
leaf cutter ants.
And they,
they,</v>

2551
02:29:48.141 --> 02:29:52.310
they not only do they have this incredibly complex system,

2552
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:56.870
but in it they have ventilation because these leaves,

2553
02:29:57.290 --> 02:29:58.940
these leaves are decaying.

2554
02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:03.860
So in order to give these leaves air so that the fumes from these leaves can

2555
02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:07.910
escape,
they created fucking ventilation systems.
That's insane.

2556
02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:09.230
Talk them this who

2557
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:12.140
<v 1>taught the man who taught,
they say answered the only one,</v>

2558
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:15.530
only species that have pets because like a fits,

2559
02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:17.180
when you have a fits on your plants,

2560
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:21.290
they bring the aphids basically to your plant and then they milk them cause the

2561
02:30:21.291 --> 02:30:24.140
aphids suck the,
um,
the sugars out of your plant.

2562
02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:28.010
And then they have these little things on tobacco,
like titties and they,

2563
02:30:28.011 --> 02:30:31.640
and the ants get the milk,
suck that out of them.

2564
02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:36.920
So they literally,
it's like there's their cattle or some shit.
Fuck,

2565
02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:40.970
I had some,
like I have these,

2566
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:45.430
the bees and they were in the front of the hive and they were,
you know,

2567
02:30:45.620 --> 02:30:48.680
crowded.
And I'm like,
what the hell is happening?
So,
and I'm like,

2568
02:30:48.681 --> 02:30:53.020
what did they have?
And they were moving.
And so all of a sudden was,
no,
there was,

2569
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:56.010
it was a rubber band.
It was a rubber band that,

2570
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:58.310
that because when we put the frames in,

2571
02:30:58.311 --> 02:31:02.060
somebody that kept the rubber bands on them to hold up the,
um,
the wax stuff.

2572
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:06.890
And I'm so the,
the ants like,
get that Shit Outta here.
So these,

2573
02:31:07.050 --> 02:31:10.460
I'm saying to bees,
literally drug these rubber,

2574
02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:15.461
cut the rubber bands first and drug them out and then dry.

2575
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:17.840
I got pictures of this and then drop them,

2576
02:31:17.841 --> 02:31:21.630
like flew a little and then dropped him and then even moved once the thing was

2577
02:31:21.631 --> 02:31:25.380
on the ground and moving them further away.
So I'm,
and I got,
I got this,
I'm like,

2578
02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:28.890
what the hell is happening?
And then,
so I saw all the rubber bands,

2579
02:31:28.891 --> 02:31:32.480
so it was like eight rubber bands that they did this to.
Wow.
And it's,
it's,

2580
02:31:32.490 --> 02:31:36.830
it's like I got some brilliant shots of it and you,
you,
it's like hot.

2581
02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:40.410
And so you've got aunts pulling this side of the rubber man ans pulling that

2582
02:31:40.411 --> 02:31:43.590
side of the rubber feet.
How I keep saying bees?
Yes.

2583
02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:48.830
<v 3>Fascinating.
So did they affect how it's suspended?</v>

2584
02:31:49.010 --> 02:31:49.843
The

2585
02:31:49.890 --> 02:31:52.740
<v 1>guests?
They let,
I guess it was up already when they did it.</v>

2586
02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:55.770
That what they were like,
Hey,
do this thing,
we ain't about this,

2587
02:31:55.771 --> 02:31:56.620
get this rubber band.

2588
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:59.470
<v 3>No,
I mean,
I don't want to what it was,</v>

2589
02:31:59.471 --> 02:32:04.120
but you could see they literally cut the rubber bands.
Wow.
Yeah.

2590
02:32:04.121 --> 02:32:07.030
So it's,
there was pretty,
uh,

2591
02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:10.630
so it's a lot that I think we have to still have to learn that we don't know.

2592
02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:13.700
Well,
I've told the story before on this podcast while I told you,
um,

2593
02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:15.280
one time when we're doing fear factor,

2594
02:32:15.281 --> 02:32:18.910
we covered people with bs and we had this dude who was a beekeeper.

2595
02:32:18.911 --> 02:32:22.240
He brought in his colony and you'd cover people with bees and they had to stand

2596
02:32:22.241 --> 02:32:25.030
there and covered with bees.
Well,
while we're doing that,

2597
02:32:25.031 --> 02:32:29.650
we were doing it at this ranch.
And,
uh,
local colony showed up.

2598
02:32:29.890 --> 02:32:33.430
That wasn't even the one that wasn't his.
And so he had to back away.

2599
02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:35.080
He told everybody,
we got to shut down,

2600
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:37.210
we got to a local and they got to work this out.

2601
02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:40.870
So we had a backup and get out of the way.
Big Gang fight.

2602
02:32:40.930 --> 02:32:45.130
And the local bees and his bees communicated with each other.

2603
02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.370
They didn't fight,
but they were in the air and they were fucking swarm.

2604
02:32:48.371 --> 02:32:50.470
And you can literally see,
you can see them.

2605
02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:55.780
We see the two different clientele.
He couldn't tell,
no one could tell,

2606
02:32:55.781 --> 02:32:58.020
but they could tell.
And the,

2607
02:32:58.021 --> 02:33:02.480
the local colony left and his colony came back into his,
you know,
his,

2608
02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:05.580
those hives,
those things that he carries around with them,
those,

2609
02:33:05.810 --> 02:33:09.910
those trays that looked like filters for an air conditioning system,
you know,

2610
02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:13.450
and they had to work it out.
They worked it out for like 20 minutes,
half hour,

2611
02:33:13.451 --> 02:33:16.270
whatever the fuck it was.
And then they took off and they're like,

2612
02:33:16.271 --> 02:33:18.500
what the fuck are you guys doing here?
Oh,
we fell in a show,
you know,

2613
02:33:18.501 --> 02:33:21.740
like they had to have a conversation.
I had a like,
why are you guys here?

2614
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:26.530
Who was these foods?
So what happened to the people that were covered with bees?

2615
02:33:26.531 --> 02:33:29.830
Where they covered already or no,
it was in between.
Oh,
we're transitioning.

2616
02:33:29.831 --> 02:33:32.340
So it was lucky.
And when these be showed up,

2617
02:33:32.341 --> 02:33:35.860
the one shows up and then a bunch showed up and then a whole cloud of 'em showed

2618
02:33:35.861 --> 02:33:39.370
up.
I'm glad you brought that up.
How many people did you guys kill him?

2619
02:33:39.371 --> 02:33:41.930
Fear of you right there.
We've got lots of shit.

2620
02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:43.780
What do you think would kill people and just buried himself?

2621
02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.240
<v 1>Where a certain way or something.
I covered them in Kim tries.
People doing,
dude,</v>

2622
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:49.930
what?
Just took that?

2623
02:33:49.931 --> 02:33:54.810
We sprayed them over the city and they control the population.
Mine control.

2624
02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:59.320
Hang in somebody over in a car.
We got lucky and ocean is shit.

2625
02:33:59.410 --> 02:34:02.060
We could have killed people though.
No.
Shinde

2626
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:05.380
<v 3>you know the scariest thing wasn't even there.</v>

2627
02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:08.440
The scariest thing that I ever saw was riding bulls when they wrote,

2628
02:34:08.470 --> 02:34:12.250
when they had people road ride bulls.
I was like,
that is fucking God damn crazy.

2629
02:34:12.251 --> 02:34:17.140
Like that scary shit.
Like those bull you can't print,
you can control,

2630
02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:22.500
you can have like a really good system of safety harnesses and all these

2631
02:34:22.571 --> 02:34:26.230
different things in place where you could be reasonably assured that if you

2632
02:34:26.231 --> 02:34:28.540
engineered a stunt correctly,
the people are going to be fine.

2633
02:34:28.570 --> 02:34:31.030
That would have been not what a bowl.
You can't control shit.

2634
02:34:31.210 --> 02:34:32.530
That was the scariest one for me.

2635
02:34:32.531 --> 02:34:37.000
And when that was over I was legitimately terrified all day and then it was
over.

2636
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:37.834
I was like,

2637
02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:41.290
cause I was scared someone was going to get stomped or someone was gonna get

2638
02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:43.740
kicked in the head or any of those things can happen.

2639
02:34:43.770 --> 02:34:46.390
I'm sure you've seen those videos.
Where the fuck yeah,

2640
02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:47.980
those bulls like you know what,

2641
02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.970
I'm about sick of Yo ass and go into the audience and Gore.

2642
02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:56.200
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I've seen him do that.

2643
02:34:56.201 --> 02:35:01.030
A bulldog in where they grew up with it by the horns in Mexico.
Again,

2644
02:35:01.090 --> 02:35:04.390
testosterone.
Yeah,
that's what it is.
Just like the fucking rooster.

2645
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:08.410
He put testosterone it on.
Nice cow.
Cows are sweet.

2646
02:35:08.411 --> 02:35:09.580
They don't want to fuck with anybody.

2647
02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:14.260
Give it to a bowl and then you start fucking running at you with their head.

2648
02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:18.700
The testosterone makes them grow weapons on their fucking event.
Crazy,
crazy.

2649
02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:22.470
They grow weapons on their head that they can stick through your asshole and

2650
02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:27.550
launch you into the air.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
It's crazy.
But yeah,

2651
02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:30.220
so that,
that is the,
no one ever died on fear factor.

2652
02:35:30.221 --> 02:35:33.080
And it's one of the reasons why I was happy when it got canceled.
I was like,

2653
02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:37.450
you've got a whole,
we got away with it.
We got away with it.

02:36:22.981 --> 02:36:24.720
the hood.
It's called the Vermont Square Library.
