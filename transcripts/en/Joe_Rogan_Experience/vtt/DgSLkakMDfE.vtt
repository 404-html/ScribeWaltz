<v Speaker 1>we are back again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have missed us.</v>

7
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing this shit all week.</v>

8
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.763
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

9
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>He's the longest run a podcast ever from me with his four of them in the top 10</v>

10
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

11
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.853

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

14
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>We have four podcasts.</v>

15
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like bragging.</v>

16
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.493
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pressure for me.</v>

17
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>No cause no pressure.</v>

18
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Patrick,</v>

21
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>remember back in the days of black and white TVs and phones with wires,</v>

22
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>the only way of business could avoid the post office was to least a postage</v>

23
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>meter.</v>

24
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>That's annoying,</v>

25
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>but today technology has made it so that anyone can have that possibility at</v>

<v Speaker 1>Print it out with a free digital scale that they provide and you print out</v>

33
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>official US postage.</v>

34
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.363
<v Speaker 1>Mailman comes,</v>

35

<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

65
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.383
<v Speaker 2>Hello Joe.</v>

66
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>You're the only person that's ever come in and sat down and said,</v>

67
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

68
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:41.231
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>

69
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a cortisol rush.</v>

70
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.791
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

71
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 2>he said you're getting a cortisol rush from the,</v>

72
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of about to do a pilot.</v>

73
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

74
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I could have gone a little more detail,</v>

75
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.131
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

76
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 2>please do.</v>

77
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

79
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 2>so that feeling of anxiety,</v>

80
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:55.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>that like you get before you got on stage,</v>

82
00:02:58.241 --> 00:02:58.421
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

83
00:02:58.421 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you're a comedian.</v>

84
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

85
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>You're really familiar with that.</v>

86
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.970
<v Speaker 2>You actually are expressing a chemical called dynorphins and uh,</v>

87
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.210
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

88
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>this is an endogenous chemical in your brain and it binds to something called</v>

89
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 2>the Kappa opioid receptor.</v>

90
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the counter of the endorphin,</v>

91
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>which binds to the Mu opioid receptor.</v>

92
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:17.460
<v Speaker 2>So the endorphins are the field.</v>

93
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

94
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it's nemesis is the diner fin,</v>

96
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>which is that anxiety,</v>

97
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>like feeling.</v>

98
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.561
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

99
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 2>but here's the interesting part,</v>

100
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>that anxiety,</v>

101
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>like feeling that you feel before you're,</v>

102
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>going to do something like you're really,</v>

104
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 2>that you care about or that's kind of anxiety provoking for me.</v>

105
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Public speaking does it,</v>

106
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I get it right before I'm going to do it,</v>

107
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>give a talk or something or do a podcast in front of,</v>

109
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>500,000 people.</v>

111
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 2>so that dynorphins binding to the kappa opioid receptor,</v>

113
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>what it does is it up regulates the mule opioid receptor.</v>

114
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>So that after you get that anxiety feeling,</v>

115
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you have a better endorphin rush because you upregulate the new opioid</v>

116
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 2>receptors,</v>

117
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>which bind to the endorphins,</v>

118
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>the feel good ones,</v>

119
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 2>and you actually become sensitized to them.</v>

120
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.520
<v Speaker 2>So there's a biological mechanism by which having that anxiety actually does you</v>

121
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

122
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

123
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a stress at first,</v>

124
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>but then later on you're,</v>

125
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

126
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>you feel better and you're more relaxed.</v>

127
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.321
<v Speaker 2>That's what you know.</v>

128
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:22.321
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because one of the best feelings ever is after you compete.</v>

129
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Like when you fight,</v>

130
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people get addicted to is um,</v>

131
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 2>you get addicted to the rush for sure.</v>

132
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 2>The adrenaline rush and you get addicted to the,</v>

133
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

134
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>the challenge of competition being life magnified on such an incredible scale</v>

135
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 2>that everything else seems kind of Pale in comparison.</v>

136
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>But the big addiction I think is the feeling that you get after you compete,</v>

137
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>especially if you win.</v>

138
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>There's just amazing feeling like life is incredible.</v>

139
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>He just like the ground feels better under your feet,</v>

140
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>the colors in the trees look better,</v>

141
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 2>everything looks better for a couple of days.</v>

142
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I totally know what you're talking about.</v>

143
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 2>And there's a biological mechanism for that and it's interesting because it's</v>

144
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>also the same mechanism that occurs when you are working out really hard.</v>

145
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's painful while you're doing it,</v>

146
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>but the more pain you experience,</v>

147
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the better the rush that it's the endorphin high people talk about.</v>

148
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 2>It's actually that that mechanism is anxiety inducing.</v>

149
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Stress inducing is an important factor in that because of this mechanism I</v>

150
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>talked about where you up regulate those receptors that bind to the endorphins</v>

151
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 2>and you become in your sensitizing them so they become more sensitized to them.</v>

152
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's a heat does the same thing.</v>

153
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Heat stress.</v>

154
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

155
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.021
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

156
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:35.711
<v Speaker 2>capsaicin.</v>

157
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 2>So eating spicy food,</v>

158
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>it's painful while you're eating it.</v>

159
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is there's your upregulating,</v>

160
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

161
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>those Mu opioid receptors,</v>

162
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>and you're sensitizing them to the endorphins,</v>

163
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>which is why you feel really good after eating spicy food.</v>

164
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.211
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

165
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what that is.</v>

166
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I never knew what that was.</v>

167
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I always thought it just tasted good,</v>

168
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 2>like a kind of a weird,</v>

169
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>

170
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 2>good spicy taste.</v>

171
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's dopamine responses and all that stuff</v>

172
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

173
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

174
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.601
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

175
00:05:59.601 --> 00:05:59.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

176
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 4>complex mechanisms and things going on in your brain,</v>

177
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 4>but when you're eating or when you pleasure,</v>

178
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 4>when you enjoy a certain taste of a food,</v>

179
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 4>but this particular mechanism where you've got this dynorphins and Endorphin,</v>

180
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

181
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.913
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>

182
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

183
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting and I think it's something I discussed on a recent</v>

184
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 4>article that I wrote about the sauna.</v>

185
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

186
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

187
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 4>I hope people find it interesting cause I think it's interesting,</v>

188
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 4>isn't it,</v>

189
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.913
<v Speaker 4>what it is to know about it.</v>

190
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.470
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

191
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.720
<v Speaker 5>it's gotten some really good responses to I've a,</v>

192
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I've read it and I've read a lot of the responses that people find it pretty</v>

193
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.060
<v Speaker 5>fascinating when you were talking about it in the podcast,</v>

194
00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:37.530
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of almost like the Yin and Yang of life is what you're talking</v>

195
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:37.951
<v Speaker 5>about here.</v>

196
00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like you need to have some negative in order to feel some extra positive,</v>

197
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

198
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.231
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

199
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:43.531
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

200
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

201
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 4>are you familiar with [inaudible]?</v>

202
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

203
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.171
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

204
00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:49.380
<v Speaker 5>I know I've heard the term but I couldn't describe it if somebody asks me</v>

205
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.841
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

206
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:50.591
<v Speaker 4>so what it means,</v>

207
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 4>you mean?</v>

208
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

209
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.641
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

210
00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:56.641
<v Speaker 4>So [inaudible] what it really refers to is having a little bit of stress,</v>

211
00:06:57.641 --> 00:06:59.170
<v Speaker 4>something that's a little toxic for you,</v>

212
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.910
<v Speaker 4>something that's a little stressful on your body.</v>

213
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:01.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

214
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:06.151
<v Speaker 4>exercise for sure is that he is a little stressful things in some of the foods</v>

215
00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:06.581
<v Speaker 4>we eat.</v>

216
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:07.251
<v Speaker 4>Like the Eeg,</v>

217
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:12.070
<v Speaker 4>cgs and green tea are polyphenols and some of the fruits and also in red wine.</v>

218
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 4>These things are actually a little bit toxic to our body.</v>

219
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is that this induces,</v>

220
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

221
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 4>stress response mechanisms in our body.</v>

222
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 4>The activation of a whole host of jeans,</v>

223
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

224
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 4>antioxidant genes,</v>

225
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.490
<v Speaker 4>glutathione peroxidase,</v>

226
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:28.324
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>

227
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

228
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

229
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 4>he'd shocked factors which do a variety of different things.</v>

230
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:36.520
<v Speaker 4>So a little bit of stress activates this whole stress response mechanism in our</v>

231
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:36.941
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

232
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens is now we can deal with stress better.</v>

233
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

234
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like interesting to think about adding a little bit of something</v>

235
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 4>that's toxic to,</v>

236
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:45.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

237
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:46.500
<v Speaker 4>get</v>

238
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 5>a better response.</v>

239
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.131
<v Speaker 5>So that's fascinating.</v>

240
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 5>You were talking about that last time we were here about mycotoxins that in fact</v>

241
00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 5>Michael Toxins in a small dose might induce that sort of,</v>

242
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

243
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean I totally made,</v>

244
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 4>I was wet hand waving.</v>

245
00:07:58.111 --> 00:07:59.250
<v Speaker 4>I haven't read anything.</v>

246
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Get you allowed to do that when your hand waving.</v>

247
00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:02.551
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

248
00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:07.551
<v Speaker 4>well actually maybe it makes sense that in a small dose,</v>

249
00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:07.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

250
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:11.790
<v Speaker 4>obviously you don't want something that's like very toxic and I'm gonna kill</v>

251
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.080
<v Speaker 4>your brain cells or anything like that.</v>

252
00:08:13.081 --> 00:08:13.860
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

253
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.880
<v Speaker 4>things in small doses.</v>

254
00:08:14.881 --> 00:08:19.440
<v Speaker 4>And I was assuming that maybe mycotoxins could possibly have a little slight</v>

255
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.610
<v Speaker 4>hormetic effect.</v>

256
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.773
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

257
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

258
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.741
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

259
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I that was just me theorizing.</v>

260
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

261
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

262
00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

263
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

264
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 5>fascinating though that that is sort of the way like,</v>

265
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:34.180
<v Speaker 5>especially when it comes to exercise that you need to experience this like</v>

266
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:39.181
<v Speaker 5>intense hardship in order to get this wonderful feeling of accomplishment,</v>

267
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 5>this endorphin rush.</v>

268
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:40.990
<v Speaker 5>And this,</v>

269
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.730
<v Speaker 5>I feel so good after I work out.</v>

270
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.270
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>

271
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 5>I make all my best decisions after I have a really good workout and it's just</v>

272
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:48.400
<v Speaker 5>like my body has a perspective.</v>

273
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 5>I have a better perspective if I haven't worked out in a couple of days and I'm</v>

274
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:52.084
<v Speaker 5>stressed and,</v>

275
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.560
<v Speaker 5>and then I have to make a decision.</v>

276
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 5>Oftentimes I don't trust my,</v>

277
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

278
00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:56.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>

279
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.863
<v Speaker 4>the same way.</v>

280
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm absolutely addicted to the feeling and the physiological changes that occur</v>

281
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.074
<v Speaker 4>with exercise.</v>

282
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.550
<v Speaker 4>And there are a lot of them that are occurring,</v>

283
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.121
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

284
00:09:05.121 --> 00:09:05.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

285
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.911
<v Speaker 4>in the brain and,</v>

286
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:06.744
<v Speaker 4>and elsewhere.</v>

287
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

288
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.851
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same,</v>

289
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:08.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.940
<v Speaker 4>it's what's really kind of fascinating recently,</v>

291
00:09:10.941 --> 00:09:11.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

292
00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:11.420
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

293
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.200
<v Speaker 4>you know about inducing neurogenesis when you work out that's kind of well known</v>

294
00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:18.170
<v Speaker 4>where exercise induces the growth of new brain cells.</v>

295
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.490
<v Speaker 4>BDNF is one way.</v>

296
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Igf One,</v>

297
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.351
<v Speaker 4>these things can,</v>

298
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:21.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

299
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:22.580
<v Speaker 4>you grow new brain cells.</v>

300
00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:26.170
<v Speaker 4>And so growing new brain cells has always been associated with um,</v>

301
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

302
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.350
<v Speaker 4>learning and memory.</v>

303
00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:27.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

304
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.771
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

305
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:28.071
<v Speaker 4>you're grown.</v>

306
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:29.240
<v Speaker 4>You grow new brain cells.</v>

307
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:32.780
<v Speaker 4>And they've shown that that neurogenesis in adults at least as associated with</v>

308
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.741
<v Speaker 4>new learning,</v>

309
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:34.574
<v Speaker 4>a new memory.</v>

310
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 4>But what they found recently,</v>

311
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:38.300
<v Speaker 4>and I found this really interesting,</v>

312
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

313
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 4>because it kind of changed the way I think of it,</v>

314
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

315
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.190
<v Speaker 4>is that when you grow those new brain cells,</v>

316
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:44.390
<v Speaker 4>like when you're exercising,</v>

317
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

318
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 4>heat stress does the same thing actually.</v>

319
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.880
<v Speaker 4>So getting in the sauna,</v>

320
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.950
<v Speaker 4>when you're exercising your heat stress in your body,</v>

321
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

322
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.020
<v Speaker 4>your core body temperature is elevated.</v>

323
00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:52.370
<v Speaker 4>It's in a very similar,</v>

324
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

325
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 4>so what happens is you grow new brain cells and these new brain cells have to</v>

326
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:00.320
<v Speaker 4>make new connections with other neurons.</v>

327
00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:04.130
<v Speaker 4>And so what ends up happening is that other connections that you made with</v>

328
00:10:04.131 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 4>north,</v>

329
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.780
<v Speaker 4>so the connections you make between neurons,</v>

330
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.150
<v Speaker 4>the synapses that your form memories,</v>

331
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:09.230
<v Speaker 4>it's things that you can remember,</v>

332
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:09.531
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

333
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean you make you form these synopses and that's like a piece of information</v>

334
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.911
<v Speaker 4>remembered.</v>

335
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Or in some cases it's uh,</v>

336
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.160
<v Speaker 4>an experience that you had that you remember well you actually change those</v>

337
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:21.050
<v Speaker 4>synopses and some of them go away.</v>

338
00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:25.310
<v Speaker 4>So you kind of forget to make room for a new neuron to make a new.</v>

339
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:25.730
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

340
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.390
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

341
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 4>it really is interesting how also you have this connection,</v>

342
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

343
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.200
<v Speaker 4>it's a balance where you're forgetting a things that you're,</v>

344
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 4>you're totally disconnecting some connections between old neurons that you had</v>

345
00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:39.980
<v Speaker 4>previously made for whatever thing you had learned or,</v>

346
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.300
<v Speaker 4>and you're making room for this new neuron that just was born to make a new</v>

347
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:46.070
<v Speaker 4>connection and make learn something new.</v>

348
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.121
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

349
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

350
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.860
<v Speaker 4>do you have that balance again?</v>

351
00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:49.460
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

352
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

353
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.590
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

354
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.801
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

355
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:53.360
<v Speaker 4>it seems like a very important biological mechanism.</v>

356
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:53.661
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

357
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 4>this mean and Yang where it's like there's,</v>

358
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.900
<v Speaker 4>there's stress and then there's the,</v>

359
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 4>the response to the stress,</v>

360
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:58.551
<v Speaker 4>which is good.</v>

361
00:10:58.551 --> 00:10:59.241
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

362
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.074
<v Speaker 4>there's things like,</v>

363
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:00.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

364
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.720
<v Speaker 4>forgetting things but so that you can learn new things.</v>

365
00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:03.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's kind of an important,</v>

366
00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:06.440
<v Speaker 4>can you imagine if you remembered everything you've ever</v>

367
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>go insane.</v>

368
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

369
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I have a real problem with that.</v>

370
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I have a real problem with having too much information in my head and then</v>

371
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>forgetting things at other people remember and they'll,</v>

372
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>they'll remember it like it was this big important thing and I'm like,</v>

373
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 1>what did we really do that?</v>

374
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.863
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that.</v>

375
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's just because I've had too many experiences.</v>

376
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Like there's too much stuff.</v>

377
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Or if you go back to talk to someone,</v>

378
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>you went to high school with people that don't leave,</v>

379
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that are stuck in that town and they can remember,</v>

380
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 1>remember when we were 17 and we did that crazy thing.</v>

381
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:35.791
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

382
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:35.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

383
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking remember that.</v>

384
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

385
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>how do you remember that?</v>

386
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:38.731
<v Speaker 1>Like him,</v>

387
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you got to get out of this town,</v>

388
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:39.961
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

389
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you're to make some new connections in your brain,</v>

390
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

391
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

392
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I know that that's a,</v>

393
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you're right</v>

394
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 4>into what's called episodic memory,</v>

395
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:47.261
<v Speaker 4>which is the,</v>

396
00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:49.820
<v Speaker 4>the type of memory that's associated with experiences.</v>

397
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.403
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

398
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of different things that can regulate that.</v>

399
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 4>One.</v>

400
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 4>One would be like a very strong emotional response.</v>

401
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Like you're Mcdilla is activated.</v>

402
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 4>So if something you'll probably remember things that are fear inducing or</v>

403
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 4>something that's really exciting,</v>

404
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.161
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

405
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 4>really exciting to you.</v>

406
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

407
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 4>that those sorts of things can solidify those types of connections.</v>

408
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.873
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

409
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

410
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 4>also have serotonin plays a role in that,</v>

411
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.493
<v Speaker 4>whether it was a really,</v>

412
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

413
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.401
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

414
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing this other paper that I've been working on.</v>

415
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

416
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I've been looking at the role of Serotonin in brain function and dysfunction and</v>

417
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 4>also behavior,</v>

418
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

419
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

420
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 4>it seems like serotonin plays a role in executive function and specifically an</v>

421
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 4>episodic memory.</v>

422
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

423
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.211
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

424
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:33.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

425
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.770
<v Speaker 1>any episodic memory that has a big rush of Serotonin,</v>

426
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 1>would it be because what would,</v>

427
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:39.690
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

428
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what would cause that specifically?</v>

429
00:12:41.211 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Like what would make a serotonin rush and a memory.</v>

430
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

431
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:45.371
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

432
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:48.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of different things that are at serotonin release is</v>

433
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 4>happens to a variety of different factors,</v>

434
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 4>but one,</v>

435
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 4>one could actually be a very potent,</v>

436
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 4>something that's very potent that you're experiencing.</v>

437
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.801
<v Speaker 4>Do you know,</v>

438
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:00.551
<v Speaker 4>does that make sense?</v>

439
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.384
<v Speaker 4>Where it's like,</v>

440
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not just your everyday stuff that you kind of block out,</v>

441
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 4>like it's just routine,</v>

442
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's something just novel.</v>

443
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 4>And would that be like</v>

444
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the day you find out that Kennedy got shot or the day nine 11 happened or the</v>

445
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.100
<v Speaker 1>daily extreme events,</v>

446
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 1>what response would that be?</v>

447
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.443
<v Speaker 1>I think that would</v>

448
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.610
<v Speaker 4>the Amygdala response.</v>

449
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

450
00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:22.590
<v Speaker 4>Where your Amygdala gets activated.</v>

451
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

452
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.310
<v Speaker 4>but I think for the Serotonin it's,</v>

453
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

454
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.020
<v Speaker 4>it's more of a,</v>

455
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 4>they've done a lot of studies where they've looked at kind of like the pleading</v>

456
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:32.550
<v Speaker 4>it and what happens?</v>

457
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:33.780
<v Speaker 4>What happens when you don't have,</v>

458
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.890
<v Speaker 4>when you can't make it,</v>

459
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

460
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 4>you're episodic memories bad.</v>

461
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:38.371
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

462
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:39.030
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing with</v>

463
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.380
<v Speaker 1>people who do a Mtma with people who party too much and do ecstasy.</v>

464
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:43.731
<v Speaker 1>Is the,</v>

465
00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the crush afterwards,</v>

466
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.490
<v Speaker 1>is there serotonin being depleted?</v>

467
00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

468
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>

469
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.660
<v Speaker 4>What's the mechanism of action of MDA?</v>

470
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I our MD m I always forget,</v>

471
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.173
<v Speaker 1>we could pull it up.</v>

472
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

473
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.141
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

474
00:13:55.141 --> 00:14:00.141
<v Speaker 1>MDM may supposedly has some function with a rushing serotonin into your system</v>

475
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you this gigantic,</v>

476
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.720
<v Speaker 1>let's see if it gives you a,</v>

477
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:07.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

478
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

479
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.180
<v Speaker 1>induce euphoria,</v>

480
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>sense of intimacy with others.</v>

481
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Diminished anxiety,</v>

482
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:15.960
<v Speaker 1>mild psychedelia Psychedelia is a weird word.</v>

483
00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't seem like it should be real,</v>

484
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:17.814
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

485
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And he studies particularly in the fields of psychology and cognitive therapy,</v>

486
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.620
<v Speaker 1>so they use it a lot.</v>

487
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Lately.</v>

488
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It's been used a lot for PTSD,</v>

489
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.760
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting because,</v>

490
00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:27.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

491
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

492
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I've only taken it once.</v>

493
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I took it once a long time ago.</v>

494
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I never took it again and never had the desire to take it again.</v>

495
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Although I had a very positive experience with it because the,</v>

496
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the downside,</v>

497
00:14:37.741 --> 00:14:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but the next day was just brutal.</v>

498
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't read.</v>

499
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.151
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

500
00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was in a coffee shop and I was trying to read a magazine and I</v>

501
00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:48.030
<v Speaker 1>couldn't focus enough to read a paragraph.</v>

502
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.290
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't focus.</v>

503
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.640
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing going on.</v>

504
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And my brain was just like,</v>

505
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:51.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

506
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

507
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.170
<v Speaker 2>my brain felt like a dry sponge.</v>

508
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Just some,</v>

509
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>some things that happen when you release a lot of Serotonin,</v>

510
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

511
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>into your synopsis is that your body,</v>

512
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 2>because there's,</v>

513
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.371
<v Speaker 2>it's too much.</v>

514
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 2>There's more than,</v>

515
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

516
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to have,</v>

517
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll start to downregulate other receptors and there seems to,</v>

518
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 2>there's like a negative feedback.</v>

519
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So what would happen then is the next day you're not going to be as responsive</v>

520
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 2>to that Serotonin.</v>

521
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

522
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

523
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 2>that's something that's a big problem with some Ssri drugs and things like that</v>

524
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>

525
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

526
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 2>you're basically preventing the serotonin from being Metabo re metabolized,</v>

527
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:27.763
<v Speaker 2>taken back up.</v>

528
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.670
<v Speaker 2>And so it sits around and these synapse for a lot longer than it's supposed to</v>

529
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 2>and they've shown that the consequence to that is you actually downregulate</v>

530
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>serotonin receptors,</v>

531
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 2>which is what,</v>

532
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

533
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 2>serotonin receptor response to the Serotonin that you're releasing.</v>

534
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So you can't respond to it then,</v>

535
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:43.701
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>

537
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of these feedback mechanisms that occur.</v>

538
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

539
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:47.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even know all of them.</v>

541
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

542
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

543
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex.</v>

544
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.830
<v Speaker 2>It's listed in Wiki onto the longterm effects that it causes.</v>

545
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 2>A down regulation of Serotonin reuptake transporters in the brain,</v>

546
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the rate at which the brain recovers from serotonergic searching.</v>

547
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's an urgent changes is unclear.</v>

548
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Once that demonstrated a lasting serotonergic changes to nurture,</v>

549
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 2>to nurture in some animals exposed to Mtma,</v>

550
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 2>other studies have suggested that brain may recover from the damage.</v>

551
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

552
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that do it,</v>

553
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:22.800
<v Speaker 2>they take five HTP to try to juice up their serotonin.</v>

554
00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>They ticket while they're doing MTMA and then they take it afterwards.</v>

555
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

556
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I have to be really careful when you're combining multiple drugs that are</v>

557
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 2>affecting like Serotonin for example,</v>

558
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 2>or that pathway because then you can end up getting something called,</v>

559
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I think they call it Serotonin Syndrome,</v>

560
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.161
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

561
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>like people that are taking ssrs have to be really careful and not take a bunch</v>

562
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:42.944
<v Speaker 2>of trip defenders.</v>

563
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

564
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>because then you can induce like I toxicity.</v>

565
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

566
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty dangerous.</v>

567
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.460
<v Speaker 2>And I forget what all the,</v>

568
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you decide,</v>

570
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.351
<v Speaker 2>you know what all of the,</v>

571
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 2>the actual effects of Serotonin Syndrome are,</v>

572
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:54.721
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

573
00:16:54.721 --> 00:16:55.554
<v Speaker 2>they're not good.</v>

574
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

575
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:56.631
<v Speaker 2>Not good at all.</v>

576
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 2>That's an issue with people also that are taking five HTP.</v>

577
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.940
<v Speaker 2>If they're on a Serotonin,</v>

578
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.130
<v Speaker 2>a SSRI,</v>

579
00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:03.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

580
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>And they take a five HTP,</v>

581
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you can get this serotonin syndrome.</v>

582
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

583
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 2>the other thing about Serotonin,</v>

584
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:10.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

585
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 2>we always think about it as being a brain.</v>

586
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

587
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical,</v>

588
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

589
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 2>A neurotransmitter in the brain,</v>

590
00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 2>but actually the majority of the Serotonin in your bodies is not in your brain.</v>

591
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:22.010
<v Speaker 2>It's made in your gut.</v>

592
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.031
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

593
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

594
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 2>So actually just published a paper.</v>

595
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 2>It was published the last time I was on this podcast.</v>

596
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:29.061
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

597
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 2>my paper,</v>

598
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it was,</v>

599
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 2>it just came out in press the day that I was on this podcast.</v>

600
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

601
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

602
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there's two different genes that they're,</v>

603
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

604
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>that convert tryptofan into five HTP.</v>

605
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.031
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

606
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:47.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the rate limiting step where you convert trip to fan into five</v>

607
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 2>hydroxytryptophan and they're called,</v>

608
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>that's called Tryptophan</v>

609
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 4>hydroxylase.</v>

610
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.211
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

611
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 4>And there's one enzyme called Tryptophan hydroxylase,</v>

612
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 4>one that's local.</v>

613
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 4>It's local,</v>

614
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.401
<v Speaker 4>localized,</v>

615
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:01.020
<v Speaker 4>are located outside of the blood brain barrier and it's predominantly found in</v>

616
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:01.854
<v Speaker 4>the gut,</v>

617
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 4>but it's also found in the pineal gland,</v>

618
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 4>which is actually separated by the blood brain barrier.</v>

619
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

620
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 4>it's close to the brain,</v>

621
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 4>but it's actually separated.</v>

622
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 4>And it's also found in a seminar t cells and placenta tissue.</v>

623
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

624
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 4>and then there's Tryptophan hydroxylase to which is the brain form.</v>

625
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's found in the Dorsal raphe a part,</v>

626
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 4>the mid part of your brain.</v>

627
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.363
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

628
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

629
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.190
<v Speaker 4>there's also some expressions.</v>

630
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 4>So your gut has neurons in it as well.</v>

631
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 4>And Terrick neurons,</v>

632
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 4>that enzyme,</v>

633
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 4>that's the neuron one.</v>

634
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 4>There's some of that also in your gut,</v>

635
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 4>but mostly it's the other enzymes.</v>

636
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 4>So there's Tryptophan hydroxylase one Tryptophan hydroxylase too.</v>

637
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 4>They both make serotonin.</v>

638
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 4>So serotonin made in your gut,</v>

639
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.243
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

640
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.320
<v Speaker 4>actually causes GI inflammation and they've shown this in,</v>

641
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 4>in like mouse models because what happens is serotonin made in the gut,</v>

642
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.860
<v Speaker 4>activates t cells and t cells have a receptor to it on their cell surface.</v>

643
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 4>And when they respond to Serotonin,</v>

644
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 4>they proliferate and grow more.</v>

645
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 4>And so if you're making,</v>

646
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 4>if you have a bunch of Serotonin in your gut,</v>

647
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.590
<v Speaker 4>you can get GI inflammation.</v>

648
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.371
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

649
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:05.820
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

650
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 4>I think this has also been documented with people that take too much five HTP,</v>

651
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:09.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

652
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 4>as well as,</v>

653
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

654
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 4>people with colitis and such.</v>

655
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:15.950
<v Speaker 4>They've done mouse models where they knock out that enzyme church of a</v>

656
00:19:15.951 --> 00:19:16.411
<v Speaker 4>hydroxylase,</v>

657
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 4>one that makes serotonin in the gut and it completely ameliorates that the</v>

658
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory like,</v>

659
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

660
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 4>symptoms in those,</v>

662
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:26.040
<v Speaker 4>in those mouse models.</v>

663
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

664
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

665
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 4>the other enzyme in your brain.</v>

666
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.610
<v Speaker 4>So this is where my paper comes in and sort of,</v>

667
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

668
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.560
<v Speaker 4>it's a theoretical paper,</v>

669
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 4>but I found a mechanism.</v>

670
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 4>So with theoretical paper means I didn't actually do any experiments on mice.</v>

671
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:40.800
<v Speaker 4>I didn't actually do a clinical trial.</v>

672
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.431
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

673
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:46.431
<v Speaker 4>I found an underlying mechanism and I explained it all and found all this stuff</v>

674
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 4>that was buried in the literature and put it all together.</v>

675
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It's actually my first theoretical paper that I've ever written in publishers.</v>

676
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

677
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>

678
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 4>So what I found was that these two enzymes for Tryptophan hydroxylase both have</v>

679
00:19:56.251 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 4>what's called a vitamin D response element in it,</v>

680
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 4>which is a telltale sequence that vitamin D,</v>

681
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 4>when vitamin D binds to a vitamin D receptor,</v>

682
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 4>it recognizes that and it can turn on a gene or it turns off a gene.</v>

683
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 4>And when it turns on gene gene does what it's supposed to do and turns it off,</v>

684
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like it's not there.</v>

685
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 4>What I found with it is that that,</v>

686
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 4>so the sequence itself of this vitamin D element,</v>

687
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

688
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 4>can determine whether or not it's going to turn it on or off.</v>

689
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:24.570
<v Speaker 4>And I found these two different enzymes of Tryptophan hydroxylase had a</v>

690
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 4>different response elements.</v>

691
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 4>One wasn't on sick signal and one was an off signal.</v>

692
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 4>The one in the brain was an on signal and the one in the gut wasn't off signal</v>

693
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 4>suggesting that vitamin D was regulating the production of Serotonin in opposite</v>

694
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 4>directions in different tissues.</v>

695
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 4>So you needed it to make it in your brain,</v>

696
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.010
<v Speaker 4>but if you had enough vitamin D,</v>

697
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 4>it would shut off the gut one,</v>

698
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.291
<v Speaker 4>not completely,</v>

699
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.100
<v Speaker 4>but turns it so that you're not making as much serotonin.</v>

700
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 4>You don't have as much Gi inflammation.</v>

701
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 4>And then I related this to autism because I know I'm getting way out there,</v>

702
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:55.641
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

703
00:20:55.641 --> 00:20:55.921
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

704
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:56.711
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool.</v>

705
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:57.460
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

706
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:57.671
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

707
00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 4>autism has been on the rise.</v>

708
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:00.581
<v Speaker 4>Like right now.</v>

709
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 4>The most recent CDC report that came out said that one in 68 children have</v>

710
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.003
<v Speaker 4>autism.</v>

711
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:06.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

712
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:06.851
<v Speaker 4>it's been,</v>

713
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:09.500
<v Speaker 4>it's risen like 600% since the 1970s.</v>

714
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 4>It's astronomical.</v>

715
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Like how much it's risen.</v>

716
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 4>So they can't really,</v>

717
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 4>they have an identified a genetic,</v>

718
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:21.421
<v Speaker 4>cause like 70 over 70% of autism cases have not been linked to a genetic</v>

719
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:22.354
<v Speaker 4>mutation,</v>

720
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 4>which means to me,</v>

721
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.530
<v Speaker 4>something in the environment seems to be going on.</v>

722
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.393
<v Speaker 4>There's something,</v>

723
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 4>something that is,</v>

724
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

725
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.080
<v Speaker 4>interacting with possible genetic mechanisms that's causing this autism rise.</v>

726
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

727
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

728
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

729
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:38.800
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D is one thing that's been people getting adequate.</v>

730
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:42.640
<v Speaker 4>Vitamin D has been on the decrease the same time that autism rises autism's been</v>

731
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:43.474
<v Speaker 4>rising.</v>

732
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.050
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

733
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:44.351
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

734
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:46.620
<v Speaker 4>so I came up with this,</v>

735
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 4>this theory that low vitamin D during pregnancy,</v>

736
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

737
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.660
<v Speaker 4>and also during the neonate when you're a young child can lead to serotonin</v>

738
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 4>deficiency in the brain.</v>

739
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is during the brain,</v>

740
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 4>during fetal brain development,</v>

741
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Saratonin is critical to,</v>

742
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

743
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.100
<v Speaker 4>guide neurons to where they're supposed to go to make them proliferate.</v>

744
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

745
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:09.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

746
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 4>it's an important differentiation factor to help them make the kind of neurons</v>

747
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:14.171
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to make.</v>

748
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:14.981
<v Speaker 4>It plays a very,</v>

749
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:19.660
<v Speaker 4>very important role in regulating brain structure and morphology.</v>

750
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

751
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 4>what vitamin D in particular?</v>

752
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Because vitamin D three was the one that you were on last time.</v>

753
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 4>Vitamin D three.</v>

754
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 4>So vitamin D three,</v>

755
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.330
<v Speaker 4>the way it works is you can make vitamin D in your skin.</v>

756
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 4>You can see,</v>

757
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 4>you can convert it into d three.</v>

758
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:33.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

759
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 4>So UVB radiation,</v>

760
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 4>you need UVB light and it converts something.</v>

761
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 4>And your skin called 70 hydro cholesterol into vitamin D three.</v>

762
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.210
<v Speaker 4>And then this gets released into the bloodstream,</v>

763
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 4>goes to your liver where then it's converted to 25 hydroxy vitamin D,</v>

764
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 4>which is what people,</v>

765
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.771
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

766
00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:54.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a major circulating form of Vitamin D.</v>

767
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you get measured when you go,</v>

768
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

769
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 4>get your vitamin D levels measured and then it goes into your kidneys and gets</v>

770
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 4>activated to inactive steroid hormone.</v>

771
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.190
<v Speaker 4>And it's called one 25.</v>

772
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Hydroxyvitamin d.</v>

773
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 4>So vitamin D gets converted into an active steroid hormone.</v>

774
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.200
<v Speaker 4>And once it's converted into that act as to ride home and,</v>

775
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:10.034
<v Speaker 4>and your kidneys,</v>

776
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 4>what then it does is it binds to a vitamin D receptor in different tissues in</v>

777
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>

778
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 4>including your brain.</v>

779
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.960
<v Speaker 4>And it does this thing where it turns on or turns off over a thousand different</v>

780
00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 4>genes in your,</v>

781
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.734
<v Speaker 4>in your body.</v>

782
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.780
<v Speaker 4>So it's regulating a lot of,</v>

783
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

784
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:27.580
<v Speaker 4>different processes.</v>

785
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 4>One of them just to Serotonin.</v>

786
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 4>So I basically came up with this,</v>

787
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

788
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 4>this theory that,</v>

789
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.773
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

790
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Pete,</v>

791
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

792
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 4>women were not getting enough vitamin D and the child's brain was then becoming</v>

793
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 4>serotonin deficiency.</v>

794
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 4>It was changing the structure of the way the brain was developing.</v>

795
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

796
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.001
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

797
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:43.300
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

798
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.670
<v Speaker 4>they've seen now that autism actually it seems be occurring in Utero and they're</v>

799
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 4>finding now they've been doing these studies where they're finding now that it</v>

800
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 4>seems to be a good,</v>

801
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 4>strong environmental component and they haven't figured out what it is.</v>

802
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

803
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 4>so I'm hoping that people will start,</v>

804
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm not an autism researcher and I'm not a neuroscientist.</v>

805
00:23:58.731 --> 00:23:58.911
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

806
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I know a little bit about it.</v>

807
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

808
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 4>but what I did was I kind of just took a step back and started putting all these</v>

809
00:24:03.981 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 4>things together and came up with this hypothesis.</v>

810
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:10.850
<v Speaker 4>And I also found things like estrogen can activate that same gene in Tryptophan</v>

811
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:11.451
<v Speaker 4>hydroxylase.</v>

812
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 4>So estrogen can protect you.</v>

813
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 4>If you have low vitamin D,</v>

814
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 4>You can still make that,</v>

815
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 4>that serotonin from tryptophan because estrogen activates that same gene also.</v>

816
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.943
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

817
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.950
<v Speaker 4>and then the whole gut inflammation thing autistics have this.</v>

818
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 4>And I think that they're,</v>

819
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

820
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.050
<v Speaker 4>they have high gut inflammation cause they have too much.</v>

821
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 4>They have too much serotonin going on in the gut.</v>

822
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.690
<v Speaker 4>That's why the common thing with common with autistic.</v>

823
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

824
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 4>that's fascinating.</v>

825
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:35.951
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

826
00:24:35.951 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty interesting.</v>

827
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

828
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 4>I totally forgot why I got on this I totally tangent.</v>

829
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.360
<v Speaker 4>When we were talking about Serotonin five HTP five,</v>

830
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

831
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.400
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

832
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 4>that's another thing where it's like five HTP.</v>

833
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 4>The first thing it does is it hits the gut and you've got that enzyme in there</v>

834
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:52.544
<v Speaker 4>that can,</v>

835
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

836
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 4>well in the gut.</v>

837
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.380
<v Speaker 4>So Ti five HTP actually bypasses a Tryptophan hydroxylase part.</v>

838
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

839
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 4>it's now the next step,</v>

840
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 4>which is to be decarboxylated into serotonin.</v>

841
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 4>So you can actually convert it.</v>

842
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 4>If you take too much of it,</v>

843
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.740
<v Speaker 4>you'll convert it into serotonin in your gut before it gets to your brain.</v>

844
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's something to keep him at five [inaudible].</v>

845
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin does not cross the blood brain barrier.</v>

846
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

847
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 4>five HTP does.</v>

848
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

849
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 4>So if you're,</v>

850
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 4>if you're converting this serotonin immediately in your gut,</v>

851
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 4>then it's not going to get to your brain.</v>

852
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:25.780
<v Speaker 4>So there,</v>

853
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.300
<v Speaker 4>there's complex mechanisms.</v>

854
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Just tryptophan cross the blood brain barrier Tryptofan does get transported</v>

855
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:32.451
<v Speaker 4>into the brain.</v>

856
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:32.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

857
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:35.840
<v Speaker 4>And we talked about this a little bit last time where it competes with branch</v>

858
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:38.750
<v Speaker 4>chain amino acids to get transported into the brain.</v>

859
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 4>So what happens is,</v>

860
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

861
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Lucy ice solution,</v>

862
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 4>these things actually when they both,</v>

863
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 4>because at the same time they're going through the same transporter.</v>

864
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Tryptofan is a very rare amino acid in,</v>

865
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.441
<v Speaker 4>in proteins.</v>

866
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 4>It's much less abundant than branch chain amino acids like leucine.</v>

867
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:54.900
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

868
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.150
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

869
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.931
<v Speaker 4>this is it a myth,</v>

870
00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:58.140
<v Speaker 4>the trip to Fan Turkey thing,</v>

871
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 4>the correlation between eating Turkey and getting tired after you.</v>

872
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that getting tired after eating it is a myth.</v>

873
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:10.601
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a myth that it's two to trip defend because actually,</v>

874
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:11.683
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

875
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.550
<v Speaker 4>Ma to the penny oil gland.</v>

876
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.060
<v Speaker 4>So the penny old clan converts Serotonin into Melatonin.</v>

877
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

878
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 4>And the pineal gland is not,</v>

879
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.470
<v Speaker 4>it's not a part of the,</v>

880
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:23.030
<v Speaker 4>it's separated by the blood brain barrier.</v>

881
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.670
<v Speaker 4>So that competition,</v>

882
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

883
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 4>for the branching amino acids getting into the pineal gland is we're talking</v>

884
00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:31.130
<v Speaker 4>about something different.</v>

885
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

886
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.043
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

887
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 4>you probably are getting a little bit of trip to fan being converted to</v>

888
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Melatonin,</v>

889
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin and Melatonin when you're eating Turkey.</v>

890
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.953
<v Speaker 4>But Turkey,</v>

891
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Turkey has a lot of branch chain amino acids as well.</v>

892
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.470
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

893
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.060
<v Speaker 1>it's most likely just a fat fuck.</v>

894
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.960
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely a,</v>

895
00:26:47.961 --> 00:26:48.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

896
00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:49.004
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

897
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

898
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.781
<v Speaker 1>but you said it,</v>

899
00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:53.930
<v Speaker 1>not me stuffing and all the other stuff that goes along with it.</v>

900
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

901
00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you,</v>

902
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.790
<v Speaker 1>the t cells and want to get back to that real quick because you were talking</v>

903
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:01.250
<v Speaker 1>about the elevated t cell count right now.</v>

904
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that would help people that have HIV,</v>

905
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

906
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:05.960
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

907
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

908
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:11.390
<v Speaker 1>a lot like a high dose of five HTP help people who have HIV that have low t cell</v>

909
00:27:12.471 --> 00:27:12.891
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>

910
00:27:12.891 --> 00:27:13.611
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

911
00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Is it the same thing?</v>

912
00:27:14.601 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I've never</v>

913
00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.780
<v Speaker 4>thought about that.</v>

914
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:17.703
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

915
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.603
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

916
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.301
<v Speaker 4>that's an issue,</v>

917
00:27:19.301 --> 00:27:19.601
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

918
00:27:19.601 --> 00:27:20.200
<v Speaker 4>With,</v>

919
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 4>with AIDS patients.</v>

920
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:21.911
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

921
00:27:21.911 --> 00:27:22.061
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

922
00:27:22.061 --> 00:27:23.050
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of issues.</v>

923
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

924
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.221
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

925
00:27:24.221 --> 00:27:24.790
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

926
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.800
<v Speaker 4>they definitely do have low t cell.</v>

927
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.951
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

928
00:27:26.951 --> 00:27:27.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

929
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:27.641
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

930
00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:28.630
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good question,</v>

931
00:27:28.631 --> 00:27:28.811
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

932
00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:29.141
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

933
00:27:29.141 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty impressed that,</v>

934
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.913
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>

935
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:32.883
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

936
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.350
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like five HTP,</v>

937
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.930
<v Speaker 1>being converted to Serotonin,</v>

939
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the serotonin having an effect on t cell counts only gut level serotonin.</v>

940
00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

941
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:44.081
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

942
00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't no</v>

943
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.310
<v Speaker 4>effect on peripheral blood t cell counts.</v>

944
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

945
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.430
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's actually a pretty fascinating question.</v>

946
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

947
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the answer to,</v>

948
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.590
<v Speaker 4>but certainly something that I think I'll probably look into after this.</v>

949
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:54.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

950
00:27:54.911 --> 00:27:56.380
<v Speaker 1>that seems like we have some,</v>

951
00:27:56.381 --> 00:27:59.690
<v Speaker 1>we have a supplement that we sell that is a hold on up grab it.</v>

952
00:27:59.691 --> 00:28:00.610
<v Speaker 1>It's in this box right here.</v>

953
00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:04.390
<v Speaker 1>That's five HTP l trip to fan and a couple other things.</v>

954
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's called new mood.</v>

955
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

956
00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:06.320
<v Speaker 1>So basically,</v>

957
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

958
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:07.150
<v Speaker 1>you got one right here?</v>

959
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

960
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.353
<v Speaker 1>that's um,</v>

961
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.840
<v Speaker 1>as an f five HTP supplement that was originally created.</v>

962
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It was originally when we first came up with it.</v>

963
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.163
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

964
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.970
<v Speaker 1>allegedly my friend and partner allegedly likes to do ecstasy,</v>

965
00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:22.810
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

966
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And he came up with this,</v>

967
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

968
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.380
<v Speaker 1>they called it roll off.</v>

969
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And the idea would be when you came off of,</v>

970
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:28:30.731 --> 00:28:35.380
<v Speaker 1>when people do Mtma they call it rolling and when you're off the Mtma,</v>

972
00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:35.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:28:35.561 --> 00:28:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

974
00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 1>oh well that was the nutritional boost that you needed to get your brain to</v>

975
00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 1>produce more five HTP or to produce more serotonin rather.</v>

976
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Actually what's really interesting as I look at this is that you have vitamin D</v>

977
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.310
<v Speaker 4>three in it.</v>

978
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

979
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Which really surprises me because whoever made this connection,</v>

980
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.040
<v Speaker 4>but for putting the vitamin D and with the El Tryptofan I'm pretty impressed</v>

981
00:28:58.041 --> 00:29:02.270
<v Speaker 4>because that until my paper was published in February,</v>

982
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.970
<v Speaker 4>no one had known that vitamin D can Reg.</v>

983
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm sure.</v>

984
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know whoever made that connection.</v>

985
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.560
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting,</v>

986
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting that you were able to figure out to put vitamins,</v>

987
00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Ia with Alitrip defend cause I haven't seen any supplement on the market that's</v>

988
00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:16.040
<v Speaker 4>done that.</v>

989
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

990
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.173
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you,</v>

991
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.440
<v Speaker 4>whoever did this knew,</v>

992
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.820
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

993
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.070
<v Speaker 4>because because tryptofan you know,</v>

994
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.130
<v Speaker 4>you need vitamin D to convert Tryptophan into serotonin.</v>

995
00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:26.190
<v Speaker 4>So that's actually pretty,</v>

996
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:26.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

997
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

998
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

999
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:28.041
<v Speaker 1>my partner,</v>

1000
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey,</v>

1001
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.710
<v Speaker 1>who's also my good friend is very,</v>

1002
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1003
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.940
<v Speaker 1>he's very diligent when it comes to the research involved in any of these</v>

1004
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:35.541
<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

1005
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 1>And he's also been a freak about vitamins and nutrients like his entire life.</v>

1006
00:29:39.831 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 1>His mother's a maniac when it comes to that stuff.</v>

1007
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 1>He learned a lot of it from her.</v>

1008
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And then extensive research.</v>

1009
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:45.851
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1010
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:46.031
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1011
00:29:46.031 --> 00:29:46.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1012
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 1>we made sure that we were putting something like that out.</v>

1013
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to make sure that we had all the bases covered.</v>

1014
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Now that's kind of cool that the vitamin D's in there,</v>

1015
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have expected that the,</v>

1016
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 1>the pineal gland is a fascinating gland that the fact that that is what creates</v>

1017
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>so many different elements that regulate mood and that also,</v>

1018
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1019
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're familiar with this,</v>

1020
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:07.661
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

1021
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1022
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 1>there's always been this thing about dimethyltryptamine,</v>

1023
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 1>which is the psychedelic drug that's produced by the brain.</v>

1024
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.700
<v Speaker 1>It's also produced by the liver and the lungs while they've,</v>

1025
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 1>they've found recently,</v>

1026
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>like within the last year,</v>

1027
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1028
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 1>evidence that it's produced by the pineal gland.</v>

1029
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It's always been like this big,</v>

1030
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1031
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.271
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

1032
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:25.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.410
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1034
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 1>there was anecdotal evidence,</v>

1035
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:29.800
<v Speaker 1>but there was never real hard evidence until they,</v>

1036
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>they actually showed that in live mice,</v>

1037
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:37.530
<v Speaker 1>the pineal gland is producing dimethyltryptamine and that's the third eye.</v>

1038
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean the pineal gland,</v>

1039
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:40.990
<v Speaker 1>in reptiles.</v>

1041
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's producing it when you sleep or well it's producing it during different</v>

1042
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 1>periods of stress during rem sleep.</v>

1043
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1044
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.111
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

1045
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:50.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get a brain,</v>

1047
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1048
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.070
<v Speaker 1>hard to get a mouse to sleep or you got to fucking big saw mark on its brain or</v>

1049
00:30:57.071 --> 00:30:57.270
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1050
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.530
<v Speaker 1>an opening in his brain and your testing.</v>

1051
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's pineal gland.</v>

1052
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So the amount of evidence they have about humans,</v>

1053
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.310
<v Speaker 1>but when and where is a,</v>

1054
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.630
<v Speaker 1>is kind of limited.</v>

1055
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.710
<v Speaker 1>But now they're making these,</v>

1056
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 1>correlating,</v>

1057
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1058
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1059
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1060
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 1>they're making a correlation based on the Mammo,</v>

1061
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 1>based on them and the mice,</v>

1062
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to do more studies on human beings,</v>

1063
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 1>more accurate studies and trying to come up with a more accurate ways of</v>

1064
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:23.440
<v Speaker 1>testing,</v>

1065
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 1>especially during different stages.</v>

1066
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Because the hypothesis is,</v>

1067
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:28.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1068
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 1>the theories that when,</v>

1069
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1070
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>during heavy rem sleep and,</v>

1071
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1072
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 1>during periods of extreme stress when your body believes that it's going to die,</v>

1073
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.130
<v Speaker 1>like if you're under extreme physical trauma,</v>

1074
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 1>like people that have had extreme physical trauma,</v>

1075
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:41.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1076
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 1>and they have that go to the light moment.</v>

1077
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.430
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1078
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.030
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that that's a dimethyltryptamine rush and that the reason why they</v>

1079
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 1>have these intense after life experiences.</v>

1080
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And they came,</v>

1081
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I came back and it was amazing.</v>

1082
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I got to see my mother and I went to this place and God was there.</v>

1083
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You can get there.</v>

1084
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.770
<v Speaker 1>If you take psychedelic drugs,</v>

1085
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 1>you can get there right now as a healthy person can have almost the exact same</v>

1086
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.320
<v Speaker 1>type of experience with a psychedelic drugs.</v>

1087
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's just a crazy psychedelic drug.</v>

1088
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause your own brain makes dimethyltryptamine,</v>

1089
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1090
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.290
<v Speaker 1>that you produced in the pineal gland crosses over the blood brain barrier and</v>

1091
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:19.810
<v Speaker 1>starts affecting things like in your brain.</v>

1092
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Does it,</v>

1093
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.770
<v Speaker 1>is it binding to different receptors and stuff in your brain?</v>

1094
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be a question for someone far smarter than me,</v>

1095
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:25.834
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1096
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.760
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1097
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 1>the drug,</v>

1098
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1099
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca I'm sure you've heard of that.</v>

1100
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of dimethyltryptamine as well and I just am not a well versed in the</v>

1101
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>whole field.</v>

1102
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:37.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1103
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just a crazy drug because it's the most potent psychedelic drug known to</v>

1104
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:43.610
<v Speaker 1>man and it's the one produced by your own brain.</v>

1105
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.171
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1106
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>

1107
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it pretty loose?</v>

1108
00:32:47.321 --> 00:32:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Like is,</v>

1109
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>is it like from Melatonin or is it completely different?</v>

1110
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.381
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>

1111
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:54.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's very similar to Melatonin in its chemical structure.</v>

1112
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:54.601
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1113
00:32:54.601 --> 00:32:55.434
<v Speaker 1>it's related.</v>

1114
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they're close.</v>

1115
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.453
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1116
00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1117
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 1>because Melatonin regulates the sleep wake cycle and the circadian rhythm.</v>

1118
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.843
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1119
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:05.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1120
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:05.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

1121
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if it's very similar in structure to Melatonin.</v>

1122
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Would it have any role in that as well,</v>

1123
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.993
<v Speaker 1>Katie and rhythm?</v>

1124
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all connected.</v>

1125
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean they tried to like,</v>

1126
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:15.501
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1127
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.041
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1128
00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:16.874
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1129
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.193
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1130
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 1>when you look at,</v>

1131
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:20.144
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1132
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 1>any of the,</v>

1133
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.690
<v Speaker 1>any of the studies that they've done on a,</v>

1134
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:25.520
<v Speaker 1>on the human mind and,</v>

1135
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:25.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1136
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 1>the studies that they've done connecting various hormones and,</v>

1137
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.801
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1138
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1139
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.911
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

1140
00:33:31.911 --> 00:33:32.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1141
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1142
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.050
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a diamond field trip to mean or Melatonin or Tryptofan,</v>

1143
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably pretty safe to say that it's kind of,</v>

1144
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:40.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1145
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>we know a lot about that stuff or they know a lot about that stuff,</v>

1146
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but they're not entirely certain about all the different effects that these</v>

1147
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.850
<v Speaker 1>regulating hormones have on the brain.</v>

1148
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Is that safe to say?</v>

1149
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:52.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1150
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:53.331
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1151
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.590
<v Speaker 1>It's very complex.</v>

1152
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.860
<v Speaker 1>I think they're probably the most ignorant about dimethyltryptamine because if,</v>

1153
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

1154
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1155
00:34:01.201 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

1156
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.730
<v Speaker 1>it's been thought of as a recreational drug for a long time so people aren't</v>

1157
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 1>studying as much probably,</v>

1158
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 1>well the only guy that I know that's had grants to study it and has been allowed</v>

1159
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 1>to study it by the,</v>

1160
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.071
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>

1161
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 1>the food and drug administration or who regulates,</v>

1162
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:15.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1163
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1164
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be the FDA that would regulate that.</v>

1165
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Now in terms of like the recreational drugs,</v>

1166
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1167
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:23.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1168
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:24.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1169
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the FDA because it diamond field trip to me is a really weird one</v>

1170
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Speaker 1>because although it's illegal,</v>

1171
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it's in so many different things,</v>

1172
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.170
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to get the sources illegal because dimethyltryptamine is in like</v>

1173
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 1>a thousand different plants and it's in grass.</v>

1174
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:39.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1175
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:40.544
<v Speaker 1>you could get graph,</v>

1176
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.000
<v Speaker 1>you could literally get flares grasp.</v>

1177
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1178
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 1>you just go mow a lawn,</v>

1179
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the flares grass lawn,</v>

1180
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.440
<v Speaker 1>take the bag of that shit,</v>

1181
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 1>bring it to a lab somewhere and you got DMT and you have a schedule one drug and</v>

1182
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of Anna's cat.</v>

1183
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1184
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 1>she passed away recently.</v>

1185
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:56.144
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

1186
00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.050
<v Speaker 1>he liked to go out side and Tewa she heard some grass like,</v>

1187
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:00.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like,</v>

1188
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.813
<v Speaker 1>and she would,</v>

1189
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 1>she would get real crazy about it too.</v>

1190
00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>

1191
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:06.540
<v Speaker 1>like you want to see something really crazy.</v>

1193
00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>You want to see a Jaguar trip out,</v>

1194
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:13.210
<v Speaker 1>pull that video of a Jaguar tripping out on DMT Jaguars in the Amazon.</v>

1195
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Find these DMT rich plants and the chew them and eat them and have psychedelic</v>

1196
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:19.154
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

1197
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>And they have a different,</v>

1198
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 1>apparently they have a different way of processing things in their stomachs than</v>

1199
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>we do because they're primarily carnivores so they don't have the same gut</v>

1200
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:31.790
<v Speaker 1>enzymes and things like,</v>

1201
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1202
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 1>here's the Jaguar up little place for you.</v>

1203
00:35:35.331 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll discuss it.</v>

1204
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's so crazy because this Jaguar like they do it actively.</v>

1205
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like something they do on a regular basis and they've observed that many</v>

1206
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:47.341
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

1207
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat these grasses and these plants rather.</v>

1208
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.510
<v Speaker 1>And then they just tripped it balls up.</v>

1209
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Raw Lodge cards.</v>

1210
00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:58.970
<v Speaker 6>Jackie was,</v>

1211
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.590
<v Speaker 6>he leaves when regurgitated,</v>

1212
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.470
<v Speaker 6>they cleanse the digestive system.</v>

1213
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1214
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.320
<v Speaker 6>like cat nip some plants in juice that effects,</v>

1215
00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.340
<v Speaker 3>uh huh.</v>

1216
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.540
<v Speaker 1>This Jaguar is,</v>

1217
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.350
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1218
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.720
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the communist rain forest vines.</v>

1219
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.260
<v Speaker 3>It seems to cause playful kittenish behavior.</v>

1220
00:36:33.261 --> 00:36:34.094
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.670
<v Speaker 3>But could something deeper be happening</v>

1222
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.960
<v Speaker 1>that cat is seeing all kinds of shit right now.</v>

1223
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.270
<v Speaker 1>They're the king of the jungle.</v>

1224
00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Jaguars in the real jungles.</v>

1225
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.800
<v Speaker 1>People in a hallucinogenic ritual.</v>

1226
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:50.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:36:50.921 --> 00:36:52.090
<v Speaker 1>The brain's fascinating.</v>

1228
00:36:52.091 --> 00:36:52.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1229
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.850
<v Speaker 1>biology itself is pretty,</v>

1230
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.050
<v Speaker 1>pretty complicated.</v>

1231
00:36:56.051 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And you'll look at this Jaguar,</v>

1232
00:36:57.781 --> 00:36:59.020
<v Speaker 1>his eyes are dilated.</v>

1233
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the same exact plant that people use,</v>

1234
00:37:01.931 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 1>an Iowaska rituals.</v>

1235
00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.310
<v Speaker 1>So this jaguars eating it and he's lying on his back.</v>

1236
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.260
<v Speaker 1>The Jaguar also like an eight senses when he taught.</v>

1237
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fascinating stuff.</v>

1238
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Like so much of weird nature.</v>

1239
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.180
<v Speaker 1>There is still so much to know.</v>

1240
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.071
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1241
00:37:21.071 --> 00:37:21.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1242
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:21.731
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1243
00:37:21.731 --> 00:37:24.400
<v Speaker 5>the human gut produces monoamine oxidase,</v>

1244
00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:26.390
<v Speaker 5>which makes dimethyltryptamine uh,</v>

1245
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:26.980
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>

1246
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 5>it kills it in the gut so that if you consume grass that has DMT in it,</v>

1247
00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.381
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1248
00:37:32.381 --> 00:37:33.670
<v Speaker 5>you don't have a psychedelic trip.</v>

1249
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.820
<v Speaker 5>But I don't know if a cat has the same gut enzyme.</v>

1250
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:37.711
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1252
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

1253
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1254
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.031
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1255
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:39.151
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1256
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 4>your gut,</v>

1257
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.470
<v Speaker 4>your gut has a lot.</v>

1258
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's making neurotransmitters or you know it's,</v>

1259
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.011
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1260
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:46.560
<v Speaker 4>there's neurons down there doing stuff and there's a connection between the</v>

1261
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 4>brain and the gut as well.</v>

1262
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.640
<v Speaker 5>But this is so far,</v>

1263
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.380
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing about the human mind is so fascinating where someone like you</v>

1264
00:37:52.381 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 5>who is just sort of putting together all these different things that you found</v>

1265
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:56.851
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1266
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:58.070
<v Speaker 5>in different books and,</v>

1267
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.861
<v Speaker 5>and you go,</v>

1268
00:37:58.861 --> 00:37:59.551
<v Speaker 5>well hey look,</v>

1269
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:03.360
<v Speaker 5>this combination of things is going on in the vitamin D and d,</v>

1270
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 5>vitamin D depletion and then here we have this issue with autism and autism has</v>

1271
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:09.230
<v Speaker 5>to do with inflammation.</v>

1272
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 5>The Gut.</v>

1273
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.703
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I put together a lot of stuff and I explained the male dominance and all this</v>

1275
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 4>and a really,</v>

1276
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.850
<v Speaker 4>my goal was,</v>

1277
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1278
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.040
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm right on,</v>

1279
00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:19.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1280
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm wrong on some of these things,</v>

1281
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:21.290
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1282
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely right about some,</v>

1283
00:38:22.641 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 4>some of these things here.</v>

1284
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:25.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm interjecting it,</v>

1285
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:26.590
<v Speaker 4>interjecting it into the,</v>

1286
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1287
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.680
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

1288
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 4>the scientific world for all you people that actually do research on autism and</v>

1289
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:33.920
<v Speaker 4>do research on Serotonin and all this.</v>

1290
00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't,</v>

1291
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1292
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 4>that's not what I do.</v>

1293
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1294
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1295
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's,</v>

1296
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1297
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.910
<v Speaker 4>it's good to have theoretical papers like that sometimes where it's like you get</v>

1298
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 4>someone who can make all these connections where there's tons of stuff buried in</v>

1299
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:46.774
<v Speaker 4>the literature.</v>

1300
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 4>And I had a mechanism,</v>

1301
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 4>I had a specific mechanism that explained it and,</v>

1302
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1303
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 4>you kind of just say here now if you think,</v>

1304
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:54.370
<v Speaker 4>if you think it's an interesting followup on it.</v>

1305
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:58.420
<v Speaker 4>And actually we started collaborating with a group that does do research on one</v>

1306
00:38:58.421 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 4>of these,</v>

1307
00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1308
00:38:59.330 --> 00:38:59.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1309
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 4>looks at Serotonin and does vitamin D research.</v>

1310
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.190
<v Speaker 4>And they were just jumping out of their chairs there,</v>

1311
00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:04.811
<v Speaker 4>were so excited.</v>

1312
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 4>And so now they're doing experiments and if I have already found positive data,</v>

1313
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 4>which is really nice and reinforcing,</v>

1314
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1315
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.093
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

1316
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:12.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1317
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:13.030
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

1318
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 4>that was my goal is chuck kind of just make these connections,</v>

1319
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.533
<v Speaker 4>big picture,</v>

1320
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1321
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:18.150
<v Speaker 4>find a mechanism,</v>

1322
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 4>finding a mechanism by which vitamin deregulated Saratonin was amazing.</v>

1323
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:23.201
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1324
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1325
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 4>putting it out in literature,</v>

1326
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:25.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1327
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 4>but the whole vitamin D thing,</v>

1328
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D three is important.</v>

1329
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's something that most people are,</v>

1330
00:39:33.641 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 4>70% of the population is not getting an adequate,</v>

1331
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1332
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 4>70% 70.</v>

1333
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:38.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:38.951
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

1335
00:39:38.951 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1336
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 4>we have someone reach out to me on Twitter after,</v>

1337
00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:46.420
<v Speaker 4>after the last podcast and artist and he was like,</v>

1338
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:46.661
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1339
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:48.490
<v Speaker 4>I really like what you're doing and you know,</v>

1340
00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:53.260
<v Speaker 4>I've been wanting to make a cool infographic just basically summarizing</v>

1341
00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 4>everything I ever talk about with vitamin D.</v>

1342
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:59.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like all in one graphic and he did it for me and if you want to pull it up,</v>

1343
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:03.520
<v Speaker 4>it's on found my fitness.com forward slash vitamin D.</v>

1344
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

1345
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.030
<v Speaker 4>No Vitamin Hyphen d and it's a fricking awesome infographic where this guy,</v>

1346
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:09.873
<v Speaker 4>this guy's name,</v>

1347
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:10.271
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1348
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:10.931
<v Speaker 4>his name's Jason,</v>

1349
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:11.764
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1350
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Jason.</v>

1351
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Jason,</v>

1352
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1353
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:14.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:15.280
<v Speaker 4>So uh,</v>

1355
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 4>he made this infographic where it's like,</v>

1356
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:21.310
<v Speaker 4>basically I talk about how vitamin D regulates a thousand different genes in the</v>

1357
00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:22.144
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1358
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

1360
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.460
<v Speaker 4>So it starts off here.</v>

1361
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.150
<v Speaker 4>It's got this guy with all these like chromosomes and in with Tila mirrors</v>

1362
00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 4>because vitamin D is important for telomere length.</v>

1363
00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 4>Who I want to talk about that too.</v>

1364
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:32.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1365
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:32.883
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

1366
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 4>And then if you scroll down,</v>

1367
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:34.781
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1368
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:35.051
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1369
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:35.560
<v Speaker 4>he's showing,</v>

1370
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:35.771
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1371
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:39.280
<v Speaker 4>70% of the US population does not have adequate levels.</v>

1372
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was really cool.</v>

1373
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.130
<v Speaker 4>The graph to see 10 people.</v>

1374
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1375
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:43.394
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1376
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:44.643
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1377
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1378
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.400
<v Speaker 4>And then it goes on it.</v>

1379
00:40:46.401 --> 00:40:50.590
<v Speaker 4>And this is like you're a tag cloud where it's like all the things that go wrong</v>

1380
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:51.730
<v Speaker 4>when you don't have enough vitamin D.</v>

1381
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.564
<v Speaker 4>He's incredible.</v>

1382
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.673
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1383
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.281
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1384
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's like learning impairments,</v>

1385
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:56.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1386
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:57.390
<v Speaker 4>reduce Saratonin,</v>

1387
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 4>increase cancer risk,</v>

1388
00:40:58.361 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 4>all I mean by nine over a thousand different genes in the body.</v>

1389
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:01.691
<v Speaker 4>It's a need.</v>

1390
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:02.231
<v Speaker 4>Scroll down more.</v>

1391
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 4>And it shows a teal and rare because it actually DNA,</v>

1392
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.540
<v Speaker 4>DNA repair enzymes are regulated by vitamin D as well.</v>

1393
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.220
<v Speaker 4>So if you're not getting enough vitamin D,</v>

1394
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:10.054
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have,</v>

1395
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you can see that break in your DNA.</v>

1396
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.030
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get damage to DNA.</v>

1397
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.680
<v Speaker 4>And then as you keep going,</v>

1398
00:41:14.681 --> 00:41:15.250
<v Speaker 4>it shows you,</v>

1399
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:15.461
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1400
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:17.860
<v Speaker 4>all the factors that regulate your vitamin D,</v>

1401
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:20.260
<v Speaker 4>like how sunscreen blocks UVB.</v>

1402
00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:21.640
<v Speaker 4>So you can't make it with Sunscreen,</v>

1403
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.541
<v Speaker 4>a Melanin,</v>

1404
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:26.890
<v Speaker 4>which is an adaptation to prevent UVB rays from burning.</v>

1405
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 4>You actually also blocks your ability to make vitamin D and body fat regulates</v>

1406
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:31.960
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1407
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 4>So all these different body fat regulation regulates the bioavailability of it.</v>

1408
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.230
<v Speaker 4>So it has to be released into the bloodstream to get converted into active</v>

1409
00:41:39.231 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 4>hormone age.</v>

1410
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Age regulates it.</v>

1411
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 4>A 70 year old makes,</v>

1412
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1413
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 4>four times less vitamin D from their skin.</v>

1414
00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Then there are former 20 year old self,</v>

1415
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 4>all these things living in the northern latitudes and other thing people at live</v>

1416
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Speaker 4>in like,</v>

1417
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:57.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it says a above 37 degrees north with the exception of the summer.</v>

1418
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 4>They cannot make any vitamin D from the sun.</v>

1419
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1420
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 4>So the solution is vitamin D supplement and uh,</v>

1421
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.121
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1422
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:05.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1423
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 4>this is just a really awesome way to put all this great information.</v>

1424
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.071
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1425
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:10.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1426
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 4>show it with graphics,</v>

1427
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:13.101
<v Speaker 4>people like that.</v>

1428
00:42:13.101 --> 00:42:13.671
<v Speaker 4>And it's hard,</v>

1429
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:15.050
<v Speaker 4>easier for people to understand and it,</v>

1430
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.861
<v Speaker 4>and I go into,</v>

1431
00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:16.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1432
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:17.990
<v Speaker 4>what your level should be and all that,</v>

1433
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:20.040
<v Speaker 4>but I was really stoked because I,</v>

1434
00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 4>I've been wanting to do this for a really long time and I have no artistic</v>

1435
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Speaker 4>capabilities.</v>

1436
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.430
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1437
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1438
00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.340
<v Speaker 4>that's so cool.</v>

1439
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.790
<v Speaker 4>Someone just reaching out to me and,</v>

1440
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 4>and wanting to help was like,</v>

1441
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:30.150
<v Speaker 4>err,</v>

1442
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1443
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 4>it was really cool.</v>

1444
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:31.521
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1445
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1446
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 4>where is it on your website if you're looking for it?</v>

1447
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 4>I think if you sign up for my newsletter,</v>

1448
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:38.654
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

1449
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.351
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1450
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:39.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1451
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:40.131
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

1452
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:43.820
<v Speaker 4>that's how your website's getting crushed right now.</v>

1453
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to even get to is it took me five chances to get to it.</v>

1454
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1455
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1456
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 4>It's not so,</v>

1457
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.871
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

1458
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:51.151
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1459
00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:51.621
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

1460
00:42:51.621 --> 00:42:51.921
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1461
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:52.700
<v Speaker 4>the cool,</v>

1462
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.630
<v Speaker 4>the vitamin D.</v>

1463
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:54.523
<v Speaker 4>That's very cool.</v>

1464
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:54.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1465
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

1466
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.490
<v Speaker 4>The telomere mere length</v>

1467
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:56.820
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1468
00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.110
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I wanted to get to that is because I had emailed you about this</v>

1469
00:43:00.111 --> 00:43:03.090
<v Speaker 1>supplement that I had read about called t a 65.</v>

1470
00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And I had read about it because my friend Bobby,</v>

1471
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1472
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:07.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1473
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.531
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1474
00:43:07.531 --> 00:43:07.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1475
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.300
<v Speaker 1>emailed me about it and,</v>

1476
00:43:09.301 --> 00:43:09.451
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1477
00:43:09.451 --> 00:43:10.680
<v Speaker 1>his dad was taken.</v>

1478
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:11.191
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

1479
00:43:11.191 --> 00:43:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Bobby for folks on the message board,</v>

1480
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.310
<v Speaker 1>B A,</v>

1481
00:43:14.311 --> 00:43:14.790
<v Speaker 1>D,</v>

1482
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:15.121
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

1483
00:43:15.121 --> 00:43:15.241
<v Speaker 1>O,</v>

1484
00:43:15.241 --> 00:43:15.361
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

1485
00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:15.511
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

1486
00:43:15.511 --> 00:43:16.200
<v Speaker 1>y.</v>

1487
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1488
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.521
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1489
00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:18.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1490
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.080
<v Speaker 1>his damn is taking in.</v>

1491
00:43:19.081 --> 00:43:20.640
<v Speaker 1>His Dad started experiencing,</v>

1492
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1493
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:23.520
<v Speaker 1>vision improvement and I was like,</v>

1494
00:43:23.521 --> 00:43:23.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1495
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

1496
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And so like what does this ta 65 stuff.</v>

1497
00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:31.350
<v Speaker 1>So I go on to Google and I Google ta 65 and there's a whole knees,</v>

1498
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:31.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1499
00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:36.120
<v Speaker 1>crazy claims and Ilana people are selling it and you know,</v>

1500
00:43:36.121 --> 00:43:40.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a lawsuit against it because there was a guy who was working for the</v>

1501
00:43:40.741 --> 00:43:41.191
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

1502
00:43:41.191 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 1>a former executive who uh,</v>

1503
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.060
<v Speaker 1>who is suing them because he says that it might have caused him to it to get</v>

1504
00:43:48.061 --> 00:43:48.810
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

1505
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1506
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea is what they're saying.</v>

1507
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.613
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

1508
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1509
00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the company that sells it.</v>

1510
00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1511
00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:00.240
<v Speaker 1>this is the correlation between cellular aging and telomere length is rooted in</v>

1512
00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:01.074
<v Speaker 1>solid research.</v>

1513
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Telomeres become shorter every time a cell divides and when they are lost,</v>

1514
00:44:05.221 --> 00:44:09.600
<v Speaker 1>cells can no longer reproduce the enzyme telomeres tell him arrays.</v>

1515
00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.081
<v Speaker 1>How'd he say it?</v>

1516
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:10.621
<v Speaker 1>Telomerase.</v>

1517
00:44:10.621 --> 00:44:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Telomerase,</v>

1518
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:16.340
<v Speaker 1>telomerase can lengthen telomeres possibly slowing or reversing degenerative</v>

1519
00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:17.071
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

1520
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:17.970
<v Speaker 1>In one study,</v>

1521
00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:22.200
<v Speaker 1>mice genetically engineered to lack functional telemere rays tell marines</v>

1522
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.063
<v Speaker 1>telomerase</v>

1523
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Dulac functional to telomerase showed brain degeneration and shrunk and testes.</v>

1524
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>But those effects</v>

1525
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 5>were reversed when the enzyme was reactivated in such findings have sparked a</v>

1526
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 5>lot of hype and encourage a cottage industry of companies that assess a person's</v>

1527
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:43.980
<v Speaker 5>biological age on the basis of their telomere length.</v>

1528
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:49.010
<v Speaker 5>But ta sciences has taken the buzz further and they sell a pill called ta 65,</v>

1529
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 5>which it says can shorten,</v>

1530
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 5>couldn't lengthen,</v>

1531
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 5>excuse me.</v>

1532
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 5>Short telomeres.</v>

1533
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1534
00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

1535
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 4>No tilimeers yes,</v>

1536
00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:58.344
<v Speaker 4>but let me,</v>

1537
00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 4>let me explain.</v>

1538
00:44:59.130 --> 00:44:59.963
<v Speaker 4>This is</v>

1539
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.460
<v Speaker 4>so complicated,</v>

1540
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 4>but I think I can,</v>

1541
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I think I can shed some light.</v>

1542
00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:05.523
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1543
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 4>so this is all right.</v>

1544
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:07.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1545
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:07.944
<v Speaker 4>Tila Mirrors,</v>

1546
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1547
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1548
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 4>every cell in your body has 46 chromosomes with the exception of your,</v>

1549
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1550
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:13.651
<v Speaker 4>Gametes,</v>

1551
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 4>which I have 23.</v>

1552
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.020
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1553
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 4>these chromosomes have your DNA,</v>

1554
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.061
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>

1555
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 4>They're wound up with these histone proteins and that's where your DNA is.</v>

1556
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.630
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of these chromosomes are your telomeres.</v>

1557
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.350
<v Speaker 4>The problem is is that these tilimeers have a funny structure where their DNA,</v>

1558
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:29.150
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>

1559
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.431
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1560
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 4>it's a repeat of t,</v>

1561
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.140
<v Speaker 4>t a,</v>

1562
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:32.381
<v Speaker 4>g,</v>

1563
00:45:32.381 --> 00:45:32.551
<v Speaker 4>G,</v>

1564
00:45:32.551 --> 00:45:37.320
<v Speaker 4>G and there's like this structural defect in your and the DNA of the teal where</v>

1565
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a big overhang and like one of your strands of DNA is longer than the</v>

1566
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 4>other one.</v>

1567
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.740
<v Speaker 4>And so when your cell,</v>

1568
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.050
<v Speaker 4>when the cell divides and it's got,</v>

1569
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.781
<v Speaker 4>it's got a copy,</v>

1570
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:50.010
<v Speaker 4>its entire genome with all those 46 chromosomes to make a new cell with all that</v>

1571
00:45:50.011 --> 00:45:50.844
<v Speaker 4>same DNA,</v>

1572
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:51.991
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1573
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 4>there's a little gap there at the end cause it's like,</v>

1574
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.451
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1575
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't have anything here.</v>

1576
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:55.711
<v Speaker 4>What do I,</v>

1577
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 4>how do I make the new DNA?</v>

1578
00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.370
<v Speaker 4>And so what happens is the next cell then has a little bit shorter telomere</v>

1579
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 4>because there was that little gap that didn't get filled.</v>

1580
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 4>And this is happening so successfully over multiple generations year after year,</v>

1581
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 4>after year after year.</v>

1582
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Each time it gets a little shorter.</v>

1583
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Each time he gets a little shorter and that becomes a problem because these</v>

1584
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 4>telomeres are actually protecting your DNA from damage.</v>

1585
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:16.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1586
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 4>oxidative damage from,</v>

1587
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.370
<v Speaker 4>from unwinding and also from your chrome,</v>

1588
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.151
<v Speaker 4>your chromosomes.</v>

1589
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:23.800
<v Speaker 4>When your cell divides a year,</v>

1590
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.120
<v Speaker 4>they protect our chromosomes from fusing together and like getting all these</v>

1591
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 4>funny abnormal translocations,</v>

1592
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 4>which lead to cancer and other problems.</v>

1593
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 4>So you don't want that to happen.</v>

1594
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 4>And the problem is,</v>

1595
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:38.220
<v Speaker 4>is that you,</v>

1596
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 4>most of ourselves,</v>

1597
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:43.980
<v Speaker 4>with the exception of our stem cells and our lymphocytes don't express this</v>

1598
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:45.360
<v Speaker 4>enzyme called telomerase,</v>

1599
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 4>which is able to actually rebuild the telomeres.</v>

1600
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 4>It's actually able to rebuild the end where that,</v>

1601
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 4>that telomere little gap where we can't make it.</v>

1602
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 4>So it's really cool.</v>

1603
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.031
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1604
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:57.121
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1605
00:46:57.121 --> 00:46:58.800
<v Speaker 4>here's this great enzyme that can rebuild it,</v>

1606
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.640
<v Speaker 4>but why is it only in our stem cells and why isn't it an all of ourselves?</v>

1607
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1608
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.570
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1609
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 4>the gene is there,</v>

1610
00:47:04.441 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not activated.</v>

1611
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1612
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1613
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.403
<v Speaker 4>silenced.</v>

1614
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1615
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 4>a answer for that as well.</v>

1616
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:11.851
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

1617
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:15.000
<v Speaker 4>if you express too much telomerase and all these other cells,</v>

1618
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1619
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 4>what happens is you can make a cell and mortal and cancer cells have actually</v>

1620
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 4>developed.</v>

1621
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.871
<v Speaker 4>They're so smart.</v>

1622
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Cancer cells are like the smartest thing ever.</v>

1623
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1624
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Speaker 4>they've developed this,</v>

1625
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.440
<v Speaker 4>this capability to reactivate that enzyme to become immortal.</v>

1626
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1627
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.480
<v Speaker 4>but the really ironic thing is,</v>

1628
00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 4>is that it's the critically short telomeres when you're short,</v>

1629
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 4>when your telomeres get to a really,</v>

1630
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:35.921
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1631
00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 4>really short stage,</v>

1632
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 4>they go into this crisis where it's like,</v>

1633
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.851
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1634
00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:40.211
<v Speaker 4>what do I do?</v>

1635
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 4>What do I do?</v>

1636
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.291
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1637
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:44.230
<v Speaker 4>And they either die or they,</v>

1638
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:44.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1639
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 4>go into this senescence state where they don't divide or they somehow can</v>

1640
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 4>reactivate this telomerase.</v>

1641
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 4>And at that point,</v>

1642
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 4>if they reactivate this telomerase,</v>

1643
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:53.320
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1644
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:53.561
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

1645
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 4>if this is a damaged cell that already has mutations and stuff,</v>

1646
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1647
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

1648
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:57.851
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1649
00:47:57.851 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 4>we're going to,</v>

1650
00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.800
<v Speaker 4>we're going to keep you going now.</v>

1651
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of paradoxical that the short telomere length is what actually can</v>

1652
00:48:04.901 --> 00:48:07.160
<v Speaker 4>reactivate the telomerase to make,</v>

1653
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.150
<v Speaker 4>make it become immortal and make cancer.</v>

1654
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1655
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:10.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1656
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 4>if you already have mutation,</v>

1657
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.311
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1658
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 4>If it's already like an abnormal cell because you've already gotten damaged and</v>

1659
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:15.491
<v Speaker 4>stuff to it.</v>

1660
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:15.881
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1661
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:16.530
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1662
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.090
<v Speaker 4>She can take a precancerous cell and say,</v>

1663
00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:19.391
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1664
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 4>keep going.</v>

1665
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.973
<v Speaker 4>Grow more.</v>

1666
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:21.761
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1667
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:22.594
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1668
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.560
<v Speaker 4>so this is a,</v>

1669
00:48:23.561 --> 00:48:27.160
<v Speaker 4>the telomerase is in stem cells because your stem cells aren't dividing that</v>

1670
00:48:27.161 --> 00:48:27.501
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

1671
00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 4>So usually just sitting around waiting to,</v>

1672
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:32.500
<v Speaker 4>they have to come out and divide and make more of a certain cell type and then</v>

1673
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:34.090
<v Speaker 4>they go back into just waiting around.</v>

1674
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:35.290
<v Speaker 4>So they're not constantly,</v>

1675
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:35.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1676
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:40.891
<v Speaker 4>dividing meaning they're not constantly get at risk for more damage.</v>

1677
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:42.610
<v Speaker 4>And I can explain that later.</v>

1678
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:43.071
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1679
00:48:43.071 --> 00:48:44.490
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

1680
00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 4>the telomerase and the mice,</v>

1681
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:46.901
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of cool.</v>

1682
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 4>So you talked about these telomerase deficient mice.</v>

1683
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1684
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 4>mice actually,</v>

1685
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 4>it's really weird.</v>

1686
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 4>They express telomerase and all their cells,</v>

1687
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 4>their team members don't get shorter and yet they only lived two years on</v>

1688
00:48:57.941 --> 00:48:58.630
<v Speaker 4>average.</v>

1689
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 4>And so in order to try to understand the biological mechanisms by which,</v>

1690
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.380
<v Speaker 4>and telomere shortening what that,</v>

1691
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 4>what those effects are,</v>

1692
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 4>you have to genetically engineer them to not express that telomerase.</v>

1693
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.420
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is over multiple generations,</v>

1694
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 4>it takes like three,</v>

1695
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:15.910
<v Speaker 4>three or four.</v>

1696
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 4>When you get to generation for,</v>

1697
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.933
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1698
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 4>then you start to see progeria types of effects where now these mice they're</v>

1699
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 4>born to is a fourth generation of not having this enzyme.</v>

1700
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 4>It takes like that long to actually get the telomeres to it really short level</v>

1701
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 4>where it starts to have perjury effects and they start to prematurely age their</v>

1702
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:33.290
<v Speaker 4>tissue,</v>

1703
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.000
<v Speaker 4>start to,</v>

1704
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1705
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.240
<v Speaker 4>break down and they have all these sorts of aging effects.</v>

1706
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.283
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1707
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.430
<v Speaker 4>and so what they've shown is they can reactivate telomerase at that point after</v>

1708
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 4>four generations and it reverses those biological effects.</v>

1709
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:47.770
<v Speaker 4>So the tissues become younger.</v>

1710
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 4>This stem cells,</v>

1711
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1712
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:49.661
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1713
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1714
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1715
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.430
<v Speaker 4>active and making replenishing populations like they're supposed to.</v>

1716
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of cool.</v>

1717
00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like here you have this pro aging mouse,</v>

1718
00:49:58.001 --> 00:50:03.001
<v Speaker 4>you reactivate the enzyme and it literally reversed the aging in these mice</v>

1719
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 4>would have a possible benefit to children that have progeria.</v>

1720
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:09.810
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1721
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1722
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1723
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.580
<v Speaker 4>it depends on what type of progeria.</v>

1724
00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:12.851
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1725
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:15.280
<v Speaker 4>there's certain ones like there's Werner Syndrome,</v>

1726
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:16.660
<v Speaker 4>which if you,</v>

1727
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:17.523
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1728
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 4>pull out,</v>

1729
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 4>if you just Google Warner Syndrome and image it.</v>

1730
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.960
<v Speaker 4>W E r n e R.</v>

1731
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 4>Warner.</v>

1732
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.213
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

1733
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.330
<v Speaker 4>a disease that's,</v>

1734
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:25.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1735
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.220
<v Speaker 4>info involves,</v>

1736
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:27.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1737
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:28.440
<v Speaker 4>short telomeres.</v>

1738
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.031
<v Speaker 4>So you're basically,</v>

1739
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1740
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1741
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.830
<v Speaker 4>you can't rebuild your telomeres and the,</v>

1742
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 4>it's excessive to telomere shortening.</v>

1743
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is,</v>

1744
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:35.451
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1745
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:36.284
<v Speaker 4>if you click on the,</v>

1746
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 4>the one with the two with pictures of the women,</v>

1747
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:39.703
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1748
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 4>by the time they reach puberty,</v>

1749
00:50:41.301 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 4>like 15,</v>

1750
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.281
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1751
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:43.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1752
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.210
<v Speaker 4>not that one.</v>

1753
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.391
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1754
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:44.840
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

1755
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.590
<v Speaker 4>if you go back,</v>

1756
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.730
<v Speaker 4>there's the,</v>

1757
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1758
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:47.541
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1759
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 4>it's like Filipino woman there I think left.</v>

1760
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:49.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1761
00:50:49.911 --> 00:50:50.451
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

1762
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Left hand corner.</v>

1763
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.333
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

1764
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1765
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 4>So like she ages normally up until the age of about 15,</v>

1766
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Speaker 4>and then after 15,</v>

1767
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.770
<v Speaker 4>she's 40 years old in that right,</v>

1768
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 4>right hand picture.</v>

1769
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1770
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:02.631
<v Speaker 4>40.</v>

1771
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:02.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1772
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:05.950
<v Speaker 4>she looks like she's like right or 90.</v>

1773
00:51:05.951 --> 00:51:06.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1774
00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 4>she looks pretty old.</v>

1775
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.143
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1776
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:08.991
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1777
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:09.471
<v Speaker 4>in that,</v>

1778
00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:10.161
<v Speaker 4>in that case,</v>

1779
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:15.161
<v Speaker 4>it'd be interesting to see if having telomerase could help rebuild the telomers.</v>

1780
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

1781
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:21.431
<v Speaker 4>because of the potential danger of allowing a precancerous cell to become</v>

1782
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:23.000
<v Speaker 4>immortal,</v>

1783
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 4>I think there's been a lot of,</v>

1784
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people are careful about that.</v>

1785
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:28.790
<v Speaker 4>And that's why it's not like on the market right now where you're just,</v>

1786
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.440
<v Speaker 4>people are selling it.</v>

1787
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing,</v>

1788
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:35.420
<v Speaker 4>this a ta 65 stuff and this is the,</v>

1789
00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:35.601
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1790
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 4>the lawsuit is that this guy who worked for them,</v>

1791
00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:40.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1792
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 4>is saying that he got cancer.</v>

1793
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:47.020
<v Speaker 4>So the thing with reactivating telomerase is if you are,</v>

1794
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 4>if you generally are healthy,</v>

1795
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a lot of your c reactive proteins low,</v>

1796
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

1797
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a lot of inflammation,</v>

1798
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of damaged cells,</v>

1799
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 4>then a lot of precancer cells,</v>

1800
00:51:57.381 --> 00:51:58.740
<v Speaker 4>your immune system is getting rid of them.</v>

1801
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.683
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1802
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 4>reactivating telomerase in a normal cell is not really a bad thing.</v>

1803
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:06.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to make it a cancer cell.</v>

1804
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.670
<v Speaker 4>It's going to make it a mortal.</v>

1805
00:52:07.671 --> 00:52:11.060
<v Speaker 4>It's going to help you know it not have critically short Tila mirrors.</v>

1806
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:15.740
<v Speaker 4>The problem is Rianna debating it in a cell that has a bunch of damage in it.</v>

1807
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.470
<v Speaker 4>And so to me,</v>

1808
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1809
00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:19.461
<v Speaker 4>measuring,</v>

1810
00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 4>looking,</v>

1811
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.800
<v Speaker 4>looking at how much damages in your cell.</v>

1812
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:22.521
<v Speaker 4>Like we can do that.</v>

1813
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I do that right now in people.</v>

1814
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.690
<v Speaker 4>I take the blood cells and I look at DNA damage,</v>

1815
00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.040
<v Speaker 4>check it out.</v>

1816
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1817
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 4>You have to come,</v>

1818
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.141
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

1819
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:30.974
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1820
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:34.850
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to come down to the bay and the bay area and sign a consent form.</v>

1821
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.983
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1822
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Just like you signed a consent form when you a do a podcast.</v>

1823
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1824
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:40.603
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1825
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 4>Kind of,</v>

1826
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.410
<v Speaker 4>kind of like that,</v>

1827
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.870
<v Speaker 4>just to be in part of my trial.</v>

1828
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.310
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1829
00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:46.110
<v Speaker 4>so like what,</v>

1830
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:46.943
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

1831
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.030
<v Speaker 4>So what I do is I,</v>

1832
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I take blood,</v>

1833
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:52.910
<v Speaker 4>well I get an MD to take it from for me.</v>

1834
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 4>And so they draw the blood and then I take the blood and I sent her a few shit</v>

1835
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.210
<v Speaker 4>through this gradient where I can then isolate just the peripheral blood</v>

1836
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 4>mononuclear cells,</v>

1837
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:07.460
<v Speaker 4>which are like mostly B and t lymphocytes that's in some monocytes.</v>

1838
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 4>So I don't have any red blood cells or platelets or any of those neutrophils.</v>

1839
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:11.391
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

1840
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:13.250
<v Speaker 4>those are Mac macrophages or things like that.</v>

1841
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.431
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1842
00:53:13.431 --> 00:53:14.264
<v Speaker 4>and I take those,</v>

1843
00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:19.300
<v Speaker 4>those peripheral blood mononuclear cells and I look at the amount of double</v>

1844
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:21.890
<v Speaker 4>stranded breaks in the DNA.</v>

1845
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:23.990
<v Speaker 4>So I can actually measure that.</v>

1846
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I can quantify that.</v>

1847
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not only do I look at those double stranded breaks in the DNA,</v>

1848
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 4>so the double stranded breaks,</v>

1849
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.741
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1850
00:53:30.741 --> 00:53:32.730
<v Speaker 4>I think we talked about this a little bit last time.</v>

1851
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 4>So just normal living,</v>

1852
00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:36.871
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1853
00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:39.930
<v Speaker 4>it's so it's a like here's aging for you in a nutshell.</v>

1854
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 4>Just normal age,</v>

1855
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 4>living your metabolism,</v>

1856
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 4>your mitochondria are generating,</v>

1857
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 4>generating oxygen,</v>

1858
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 4>rattled radicals,</v>

1859
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

1860
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.310
<v Speaker 4>gets your DNA and you get enough of these oxygen radicals.</v>

1861
00:53:52.311 --> 00:53:55.200
<v Speaker 4>It caused the strand break and then you get them in parallel.</v>

1862
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:56.250
<v Speaker 4>You have to strand breaks,</v>

1863
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 4>UV radiation does the same thing,</v>

1864
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 4>but let's just forget about all the outside stuff.</v>

1865
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Like forget about carcinogens,</v>

1866
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:03.390
<v Speaker 4>UV,</v>

1867
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:04.081
<v Speaker 4>smoking,</v>

1868
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:04.470
<v Speaker 4>all that.</v>

1869
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Just normal.</v>

1870
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.383
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1871
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.510
<v Speaker 4>living does this and this happens every single day,</v>

1872
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1873
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 4>and so your,</v>

1874
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.170
<v Speaker 4>your body has to repair that damage.</v>

1875
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 4>And I talked about those enzymes that are magnesium,</v>

1876
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 4>magnesium dependent and how magnesium is important for DNA repair enzymes.</v>

1877
00:54:19.141 --> 00:54:21.810
<v Speaker 4>And 45% of the population doesn't have enough of that.</v>

1878
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:22.440
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1879
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at people that are obese and those people usually don't have a</v>

1880
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 4>really good diet and they're most often magnesium deficient.</v>

1881
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1882
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say deficient cause it's not like a clinical acute deficiency.</v>

1883
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:36.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're inadequate.</v>

1884
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:36.971
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1885
00:54:36.971 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 4>If inadequate levels of magnesium,</v>

1886
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 4>they're not taking enough magnesium,</v>

1887
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 4>which is 400 or so milligrams today.</v>

1888
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.580
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1889
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.590
<v Speaker 4>so I look at their DNA,</v>

1890
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 4>their strand breaks and then I have this because I think that they're not</v>

1891
00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 4>getting enough magnesium.</v>

1892
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:50.371
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1893
00:54:50.371 --> 00:54:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm not actually measuring their magnesium.</v>

1894
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:52.704
<v Speaker 4>Someone else,</v>

1895
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1896
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 4>that I work with can do that.</v>

1897
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:54.930
<v Speaker 4>But I haven't,</v>

1898
00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:55.320
<v Speaker 4>we haven't,</v>

1899
00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 4>I haven't found it necessary to do that yet.</v>

1900
00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1901
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 4>then what I'm doing is I'm a Mac,</v>

1902
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm measuring the capacity of their,</v>

1903
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:06.090
<v Speaker 4>that their body has to repair a known amount of damage that I induce.</v>

1904
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.130
<v Speaker 4>So I look at their baseline damage sandwich,</v>

1905
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.330
<v Speaker 4>how much damage is there,</v>

1906
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 4>and then I induced damage with an radiator.</v>

1907
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 4>And then I measure over time the ability of their own enzymes to repair that</v>

1908
00:55:16.591 --> 00:55:17.424
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>

1909
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:22.430
<v Speaker 4>And what I'm finding is that if I look at someone who's lean or obese based on</v>

1910
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:23.304
<v Speaker 4>BMI,</v>

1911
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 4>then I'm seeing there's differences.</v>

1912
00:55:25.441 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing that people with that are obese have a BMI of 30 or so.</v>

1913
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot more of this damage in their blood cells.</v>

1914
00:55:33.781 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 4>And not only do they have a lot more of this damage,</v>

1915
00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 4>their capacity to repair this damage is impaired.</v>

1916
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:40.771
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1917
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 4>and it makes sense to me.</v>

1918
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:42.091
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1919
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:42.301
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1920
00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:42.811
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at,</v>

1921
00:55:42.811 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about people that are eating poor diets.</v>

1922
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

1923
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 4>they're eating very macro nutrient rich diet diets.</v>

1924
00:55:48.751 --> 00:55:48.931
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1925
00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 4>they're eating a lot of processed foods and junk food and they're not getting</v>

1926
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:54.630
<v Speaker 4>their micronutrients there.</v>

1927
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Essential vitamins,</v>

1928
00:55:55.681 --> 00:55:56.071
<v Speaker 4>zinc,</v>

1929
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:56.710
<v Speaker 4>magnesium,</v>

1930
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:57.180
<v Speaker 4>these are,</v>

1931
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 4>these are required for like 300 different enzymes to work in the body.</v>

1932
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.780
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm measuring one of those.</v>

1933
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:04.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's DNA repair,</v>

1934
00:56:04.951 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 4>which is important to prevent cancer.</v>

1935
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.093
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1936
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.020
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>

1937
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.860
<v Speaker 4>what were we talking?</v>

1938
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.693
<v Speaker 4>We were talking.</v>

1939
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:12.841
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1940
00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 4>So I went on this whole,</v>

1941
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 4>so that's agent,</v>

1942
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 4>that's part of aging in a nutshell.</v>

1943
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:19.380
<v Speaker 4>And there's other points of it I can,</v>

1944
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:21.270
<v Speaker 4>we can get back to later in the conversation.</v>

1945
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1946
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 4>so ta 65 is,</v>

1947
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1948
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I was actually really impressed because I read a couple of the studies.</v>

1949
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 4>So ta 65 astragalus root,</v>

1950
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 4>some Chinese herb or something or it,</v>

1951
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1952
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:34.931
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

1953
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1954
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's from.</v>

1955
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 4>I believe from,</v>

1956
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.164
<v Speaker 4>from what I read.</v>

1957
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.213
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1958
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:39.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1959
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm saying it right,</v>

1960
00:56:40.781 --> 00:56:42.210
<v Speaker 4>the stragglers route.</v>

1961
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 4>So it has the capacity to activate telomerase.</v>

1962
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1963
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.330
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>

1964
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:50.950
<v Speaker 4>there's two different papers that were pretty good.</v>

1965
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 4>One paper was a clinical paper where they looked,</v>

1966
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 4>they gave people varying doses of ta 65 and I don't remember the exact doses,</v>

1967
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 4>but they did a dose response and they looked at a couple of things.</v>

1968
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:02.051
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

1969
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 4>they looked at the activation of that enzyme,</v>

1970
00:57:04.781 --> 00:57:06.460
<v Speaker 4>telomerase and B,</v>

1971
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 4>they looked at telomere length.</v>

1972
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.360
<v Speaker 4>So they started the trial baseline measure,</v>

1973
00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:14.350
<v Speaker 4>telomere length and telomerase activity.</v>

1974
00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:19.840
<v Speaker 4>And then they gave people these ta 65 at various doses of it.</v>

1975
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 4>And what they found is that in a dose dependent manner,</v>

1976
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.910
<v Speaker 4>the ta 65 increased a telomerase activity.</v>

1977
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1978
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:29.800
<v Speaker 4>and not only did it increase tall telomerase activity in the very high doses,</v>

1979
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1980
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.690
<v Speaker 4>in a subset of people,</v>

1981
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:37.140
<v Speaker 4>it actually increased the length of their telomere over baseline.</v>

1982
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:39.280
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen this before usually.</v>

1983
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 4>So usually you're,</v>

1984
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:44.260
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing a lot of other things affecting them or length vitamin DS,</v>

1985
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1986
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.401
<v Speaker 4>one of them,</v>

1987
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D the Way Vitamin D effects telomere length is totally different than</v>

1988
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 4>the way ta 65 to,</v>

1989
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 4>because vitamin D is preventing DNA damage,</v>

1990
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 4>inflammation and things that accelerate telomere shortening.</v>

1991
00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Ta 65 is literally rebuilding the end of your telomeres.</v>

1992
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:04.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's possible to actually start and end up with a longer telomere as opposed</v>

1993
00:58:04.601 --> 00:58:05.120
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1994
00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:09.520
<v Speaker 4>other nutritional factors that regulate just delaying the attrition of it.</v>

1996
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1997
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1998
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 4>So that over baseline they had like a 40%,</v>

1999
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:18.220
<v Speaker 4>I believe from reading that paper awhile ago,</v>

2000
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 4>a 40% increase in telomere length.</v>

2001
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.573
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

2002
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.361
<v Speaker 4>It was incredible.</v>

2003
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:23.194
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>

2004
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 4>So then I went and read the other study,</v>

2005
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.530
<v Speaker 4>which was the,</v>

2006
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.810
<v Speaker 4>the mouse study.</v>

2007
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2008
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 4>and actually the woman,</v>

2009
00:58:30.371 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 4>the lead investigator on,</v>

2010
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm very familiar with her work.</v>

2011
00:58:32.381 --> 00:58:36.270
<v Speaker 4>I was really close to doing a postdoc in telomere and the two of them were lab.</v>

2012
00:58:36.271 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Cause I've,</v>

2013
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I've been very interested in tilimeers for quite some time.</v>

2014
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:40.091
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2015
00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:43.090
<v Speaker 4>so I had been familiar with herder her papers,</v>

2016
00:58:43.091 --> 00:58:44.200
<v Speaker 4>like her publications.</v>

2017
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.071
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2018
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:45.881
<v Speaker 4>when I saw that she was,</v>

2019
00:58:45.881 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 4>it was from her lab,</v>

2020
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:47.081
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2021
00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:47.591
<v Speaker 4>oh it's,</v>

2022
00:58:47.591 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm familiar with her work.</v>

2023
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:49.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2024
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.350
<v Speaker 4>she's pretty good.</v>

2025
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:51.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty thorough.</v>

2026
00:58:51.251 --> 00:58:52.780
<v Speaker 4>And so her paper,</v>

2027
00:58:52.781 --> 00:58:56.560
<v Speaker 4>what she did was she took that same mouse model that I was talking about where</v>

2028
00:58:56.561 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 4>they over successive generations,</v>

2029
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:02.230
<v Speaker 4>they knock out that telomerase enzyme and they over,</v>

2030
00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:02.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2031
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 4>three or four or five generations and they start to get these mice that have</v>

2032
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.290
<v Speaker 4>really short telomeres that are aging.</v>

2033
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 4>Their tissues are aging quicker.</v>

2034
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 4>And they gave those mice like third or fourth generation mice,</v>

2035
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 4>ta 65.</v>

2036
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.820
<v Speaker 4>And what they found was that giving those minds to ta 65 was able to rejuvenate</v>

2037
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 4>their tissue.</v>

2038
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:23.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2039
00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:23.391
<v Speaker 4>that she,</v>

2040
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 4>she started to look younger are very similar to telomerase reactivation,</v>

2041
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:28.100
<v Speaker 4>not as robust,</v>

2042
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 4>which isn't surprising.</v>

2043
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:29.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2044
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:32.720
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about reactivating the entire enzyme versus something that's</v>

2045
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:32.991
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2046
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:33.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2047
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 4>able to activate it.</v>

2048
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

2049
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 4>the mice didn't get cancer.</v>

2050
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2051
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.640
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2052
00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 4>they didn't get any types of cancer.</v>

2053
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.083
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2054
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 4>but like I said,</v>

2055
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.041
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2056
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:43.874
<v Speaker 4>if you were to take,</v>

2057
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.770
<v Speaker 4>if you were to take a mouse model,</v>

2058
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 4>knock out their telomerase enzyme,</v>

2059
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 4>inoculate them with cancer cells,</v>

2060
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:55.150
<v Speaker 4>so give them cancer cells and then react and then giving them the ta 65,</v>

2061
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 4>it'd be,</v>

2062
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.950
<v Speaker 4>they're probably going to do that experiment.</v>

2063
00:59:57.951 --> 00:59:58.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2064
00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:58.491
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>

2065
00:59:58.491 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 4>that's the logical thing to do next,</v>

2066
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:00.824
<v Speaker 4>just to make sure,</v>

2067
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2068
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.091
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2069
01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 4>to really prove that it's,</v>

2070
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2071
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty safe.</v>

2072
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2073
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.420
<v Speaker 4>so bottom line is,</v>

2074
01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 4>I was impressed with ta 65.</v>

2075
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2076
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.391
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

2077
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:12.350
<v Speaker 4>surprisingly so.</v>

2078
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.071
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2079
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:14.630
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2080
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.471
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>

2081
01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:15.731
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2082
01:00:15.731 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2083
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2084
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:16.610
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2085
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I think there's always that risk.</v>

2086
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:18.771
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2087
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:18.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2088
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 4>if you have a lot of precancerous cells,</v>

2089
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.220
<v Speaker 4>there's no telling.</v>

2090
01:00:22.221 --> 01:00:22.491
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2091
01:00:22.491 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2092
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I obviously,</v>

2093
01:00:24.051 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>

2094
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 4>if it was a big issue,</v>

2095
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 4>more people would be coming down with cancer.</v>

2096
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:29.430
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how many people are taking this stuff.</v>

2097
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.390
<v Speaker 5>I've only heard of a couple of people that I know they're taking it.</v>

2098
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.480
<v Speaker 5>I've read some folks online and a message board that I go to that say they</v>

2099
01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:37.261
<v Speaker 5>started taking it,</v>

2100
01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:38.760
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know enough of it</v>

2101
01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.050
<v Speaker 4>about how many are,</v>

2102
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many people are taking it either.</v>

2103
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2104
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:44.700
<v Speaker 4>that that would be my one concern though,</v>

2105
01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:47.370
<v Speaker 4>is that having a bunch of precancerous cells,</v>

2106
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.560
<v Speaker 4>reactivating telomerase in those cells,</v>

2107
01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:50.394
<v Speaker 4>then pushing them,</v>

2108
01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.670
<v Speaker 4>giving them the fuel they need to then make more cancer cells.</v>

2109
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Speaker 4>That's a possibility.</v>

2110
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:58.450
<v Speaker 5>People that own the company there with the guys,</v>

2111
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.040
<v Speaker 5>it's a whole thing is really,</v>

2112
01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.180
<v Speaker 5>really odd.</v>

2113
01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:04.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly what happened because apparently there was like some sort</v>

2114
01:01:04.691 --> 01:01:05.560
<v Speaker 5>of a physical art,</v>

2115
01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:10.561
<v Speaker 5>the altercation with the guy who was suing them and they're suing him because</v>

2116
01:01:11.321 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 5>they're saying that they lost $2 million in sales because he said that he got</v>

2117
01:01:16.121 --> 01:01:16.954
<v Speaker 5>cancer,</v>

2118
01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:18.030
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2119
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 5>and they're also saying that if he had cancer,</v>

2120
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:23.730
<v Speaker 5>he had it before he started taking ta 65</v>

2121
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.790
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck could you ever know that?</v>

2122
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2123
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2124
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing,</v>

2125
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:28.160
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2126
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing right.</v>

2127
01:01:29.151 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 4>If you have cancer before taking it,</v>

2128
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2129
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying this is going to happen.</v>

2130
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying theoretically reactivating telomerase could push those cancer cells</v>

2131
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:43.550
<v Speaker 4>to full blown precancerous cells to full blown blown cancer because now there's</v>

2132
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.190
<v Speaker 4>immortalizing them and letting them survive and propagate and pull it right.</v>

2133
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 4>That here's the question.</v>

2134
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 4>Here's the big one.</v>

2135
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Is there</v>

2136
01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.560
<v Speaker 5>a diet,</v>

2137
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.880
<v Speaker 5>a thing that you can do?</v>

2138
01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:55.090
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2139
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.500
<v Speaker 5>the word is always,</v>

2140
01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:56.951
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2141
01:01:56.951 --> 01:01:58.210
<v Speaker 5>you need to have a,</v>

2142
01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:58.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2143
01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:02.500
<v Speaker 5>a cancer cells can't grow in an alkaline environment,</v>

2144
01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:03.090
<v Speaker 5>but I've,</v>

2145
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:03.641
<v Speaker 5>I've heard it,</v>

2146
01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:05.160
<v Speaker 5>that's horseshit to that,</v>

2147
01:02:05.161 --> 01:02:09.700
<v Speaker 5>this idea of alkalizing your blood and having a diet that makes your blood or</v>

2148
01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 5>your body alkaline rich is horse shit.</v>

2149
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally not familiar with any of that.</v>

2150
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:16.260
<v Speaker 4>So never heard of that before.</v>

2151
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.840
<v Speaker 4>I've heard of people wanting to alkaline their blood.</v>

2152
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I know why.</v>

2153
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I never</v>

2154
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 2>really followed up on it and I certainly haven't heard about the cancer</v>

2155
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 2>connection to it.</v>

2156
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:25.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's new to me.</v>

2157
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2158
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely heard of other things people are trying to do.</v>

2159
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:29.011
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2160
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 2>you can go alkaline cancer.</v>

2161
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 2>And one of the first things that pops up is myth,</v>

2162
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the acid alkaline myth.</v>

2163
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2164
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:43.190
<v Speaker 2>if what I've read the w that's counteracting this is that if you did alter the</v>

2165
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 2>alkaline of your body,</v>

2166
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:46.651
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2167
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 2>the variables are so small that if you've,</v>

2168
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 2>if you alter it in,</v>

2169
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:51.151
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2170
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:52.890
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of a shocking way,</v>

2171
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 2>your body just is fucked.</v>

2172
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:55.501
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2173
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>

2174
01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2175
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:57.931
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2176
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

2177
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2178
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I think with the exception of,</v>

2179
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:00.830
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2180
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:03.390
<v Speaker 2>of the gut where you're trying to actually make a little more,</v>

2181
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.583
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

2182
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 2>you want these different gut bacteria to make more acidic,</v>

2183
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2184
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.290
<v Speaker 2>to be more acidic and make more,</v>

2185
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:10.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2186
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:13.380
<v Speaker 2>acidic type of environment to get rid of the bad bacteria,</v>

2187
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:14.970
<v Speaker 2>which can't grow in that type of environment.</v>

2188
01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2189
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 2>but all the other stuff,</v>

2190
01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:17.581
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2191
01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:17.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2192
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:18.121
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2193
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 2>there's slight changes and Ph and I mean,</v>

2194
01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2195
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about activating the immune systems sensitive to this sort of</v>

2196
01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:25.591
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2197
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2198
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:29.300
<v Speaker 2>it's like all of a sudden you start activating your neutrophils and you know,</v>

2199
01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:30.330
<v Speaker 2>they don't know why they're activated,</v>

2200
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:32.100
<v Speaker 2>but when they're activated it's just like fire,</v>

2201
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:32.371
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

2202
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:32.671
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

2203
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:33.001
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

2204
01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 2>fire on their fire for firing all kinds of crap cytokines which are making,</v>

2205
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2206
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:41.850
<v Speaker 2>reactive nitrogen species which are damaging your DNA and your lipids and your</v>

2207
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:42.141
<v Speaker 2>proteins.</v>

2208
01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:42.631
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2209
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:42.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2210
01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2211
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 2>there's things like that going on.</v>

2212
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.123
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

2213
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.203
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2214
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

2216
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.011
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2217
01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2218
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.520
<v Speaker 5>this critique of it was saying that foods don't influence the blood Ph and they</v>

2219
01:03:56.911 --> 01:03:57.271
<v Speaker 5>were saying,</v>

2220
01:03:57.271 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2221
01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.250
<v Speaker 5>I'll just read what it says here on this guy's website,</v>

2222
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 5>proponents of the alkaline diet,</v>

2223
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:05.730
<v Speaker 5>I've put forth a few different theories about how acidic diet harms our health.</v>

2224
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:06.990
<v Speaker 5>The most ridiculous claim,</v>

2225
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.130
<v Speaker 5>it more ridiculous claim is that we can change the Ph of our blood by changing</v>

2226
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:15.510
<v Speaker 5>the foods we eat and that the acidic blood causes disease while alkaline blood</v>

2227
01:04:15.511 --> 01:04:16.344
<v Speaker 5>prevents it.</v>

2228
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.460
<v Speaker 5>This is not true.</v>

2229
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 5>The body type is all reference to a,</v>

2230
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:21.060
<v Speaker 5>I'll give the guy's website.</v>

2231
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a Chris Kresser,</v>

2232
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:26.340
<v Speaker 5>C H R I S K r e s.</v>

01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:28.170

<v Speaker 5>Dot Com.</v>

2236
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.363
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2237
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.683
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2238
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:30.901
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2239
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:31.681
<v Speaker 5>this is not true.</v>

2240
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:36.681
<v Speaker 5>The body tightly regulates the Ph of our blood and extra cellular fluid and we</v>

2241
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:41.010
<v Speaker 5>cannot influence our blood ph by changing our diet with references,</v>

2242
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:45.810
<v Speaker 5>a high doses of sodium bicarbonate contemporarily increased blood ph,</v>

2243
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 5>but not without causing uncomfortable GI syndromes,</v>

2244
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:50.310
<v Speaker 5>symptoms rather.</v>

2245
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.520
<v Speaker 5>And there are certainly circumstances in which blood is more acidic than it</v>

2246
01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:56.131
<v Speaker 5>should be.</v>

2247
01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 5>And this does have serious health consequences.</v>

2248
01:04:58.081 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

2249
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:03.690
<v Speaker 5>this state of acidosis is caused by pathological conditions such as chronic</v>

2250
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 5>renal in SIF insufficiency,</v>

2251
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 5>not by whether or not you choose to eat a salad or a burger.</v>

2252
01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.601
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2253
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 5>regardless of what you eat or what your urine Ph is,</v>

2254
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.350
<v Speaker 5>you can be pretty confident that your blood ph is hovering around a comfortable</v>

2255
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.550
<v Speaker 5>7.4.</v>

2256
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2257
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.823
<v Speaker 2>I do all that.</v>

2258
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:21.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2259
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>all you need to make your body alkaline in cancer can't exist in an alkaline</v>

2260
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:26.014
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2261
01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Horseshit,</v>

2262
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.393
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2263
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:27.641
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2264
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:27.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2265
01:05:27.881 --> 01:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know enough about that,</v>

2266
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

2267
01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2268
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>honestly to say definitively if it's,</v>

2269
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2270
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I really don't,</v>

2271
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I know that things in vitro,</v>

2272
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:37.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2273
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at cancer,</v>

2274
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about growing cancer cells in a dish and changing that,</v>

2275
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2276
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.833
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

2277
01:05:44.170 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 2>environment is one thing,</v>

2278
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2279
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:49.264
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>

2282
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.253
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

2283
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

2284
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:51.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2285
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:52.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2286
01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:52.511
<v Speaker 2>it's something,</v>

2287
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2288
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2289
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>if you want to email me,</v>

2290
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:55.084
<v Speaker 2>I'll look into it.</v>

2291
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2292
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2293
01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.340
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of me not having dug into something like that.</v>

2295
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:00.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:01.270
<v Speaker 2>But that's like,</v>

2297
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things,</v>

2298
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:04.900
<v Speaker 2>it just gets repeated</v>

2299
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:06.110
<v Speaker 5>over and over again.</v>

2300
01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.711
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2301
01:06:06.711 --> 01:06:06.911
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2302
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 5>this is apparently this,</v>

2303
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2304
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2305
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:10.900
<v Speaker 5>mythbusting is,</v>

2306
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:13.820
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of different websites that say that it's horse shit.</v>

2307
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:14.501
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2308
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:18.520
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of different doctors with references about the,</v>

2309
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:19.363
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2310
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:20.531
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2311
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 5>this whole alkaline thing.</v>

2312
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 5>Here's the cancer myth number one,</v>

2313
01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 5>that cancer doesn't feed on sugar.</v>

2314
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Almost every new patient.</v>

2315
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>

2316
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:28.750
<v Speaker 5>ask me about this,</v>

2317
01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:28.811
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2318
01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 5>theories prevalent on the Internet that sugar will influence blood sugar levels,</v>

2319
01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:33.730
<v Speaker 5>feed cancer,</v>

2320
01:06:33.731 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 5>and cause it to spread.</v>

2321
01:06:34.661 --> 01:06:38.230
<v Speaker 5>The truth is you can't really control blood sugar by what you eat.</v>

2322
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:43.150
<v Speaker 5>The body's complex system processes what we eat and manages to keep blood sugar</v>

2323
01:06:43.151 --> 01:06:44.190
<v Speaker 5>level stable.</v>

2324
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:44.860
<v Speaker 5>Whether that's,</v>

2325
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:45.693
<v Speaker 5>is that true?</v>

2326
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.570
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make sense.</v>

2327
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:46.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2328
01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're obviously when you're eating sugar or you're inducing an insulin</v>

2329
01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:50.351
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>

2330
01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>which then you take the sugar up into yourselves.</v>

2331
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>So that regulates the blood sugar levels.</v>

2332
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.293
<v Speaker 2>Unless that doesn't,</v>

2333
01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.240
<v Speaker 2>unless you're type two diabetic or something that's not working,</v>

2334
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.410
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

2335
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 2>then you can't regulate your blood sugar levels normally.</v>

2336
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And that's not good.</v>

2337
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:03.430
<v Speaker 2>It's saying</v>

2338
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 5>ception to this of course is people with diabetes who don't have the proper</v>

2339
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.290
<v Speaker 5>insulin regulating systems.</v>

2340
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 5>But if you apply the theory that sugar can affect your insulin levels and feed</v>

2341
01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:12.461
<v Speaker 5>cancer,</v>

2342
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 5>diabetics with cancer would all be dying of their cancer.</v>

2343
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.453
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2344
01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2345
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:18.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2346
01:07:18.711 --> 01:07:19.544
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2347
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.180
<v Speaker 2>What kind of fucking quotas that Dr Holen,</v>

2348
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:27.110
<v Speaker 2>who are you fucking Weirdo that doesn't make any sense.</v>

2349
01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.630
<v Speaker 2>He's an oncologist to [inaudible]</v>

2350
01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:35.780
<v Speaker 5>specializes in gastrointestinal and esophageal esophageal Sapa.</v>

2351
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Jayleeya esophageal cancers says at worst,</v>

2352
01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:39.961
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2353
01:07:39.961 --> 01:07:43.740
<v Speaker 5>these myths may lead vulnerable cancer patients to try untested treatments or</v>

2354
01:07:43.741 --> 01:07:44.574
<v Speaker 5>procedures.</v>

2355
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.953
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2356
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:46.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2357
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:46.961
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

2358
01:07:46.961 --> 01:07:51.961
<v Speaker 2>is that cancer cells do acquire this capability to become glycolytic.</v>

2359
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.733
<v Speaker 2>Where there,</v>

2360
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:59.040
<v Speaker 2>instead of using glucose to convert into pirate bay and go into the Mitochondria</v>

2361
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 2>and use this whole mitochondrial metabolism,</v>

2362
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.600
<v Speaker 2>oxidative phosphorylation to generate energy,</v>

2363
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:05.740
<v Speaker 2>they become,</v>

2364
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 2>they use this whole pathway that's called glycolysis,</v>

2365
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:09.850
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

2366
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a much shorter pathway and they,</v>

2367
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.170
<v Speaker 2>they're using it to,</v>

2368
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.020
<v Speaker 2>to generate,</v>

2369
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2370
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>that's how they're using to generate the energy.</v>

2371
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 4>So I think that probably plays a role in people coming up with all these</v>

2372
01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:25.340
<v Speaker 4>different theories and things that manipulating the glucose and all that.</v>

2373
01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:25.521
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2374
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:26.181
<v Speaker 4>what it can do.</v>

2375
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.014
<v Speaker 4>I know that,</v>

2376
01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2377
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I did a lot of work manipulating cancer nutrients in cancer cells and Grad</v>

2378
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.550
<v Speaker 4>School and um,</v>

2379
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2380
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:35.991
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>

2381
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:36.291
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

2382
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 4>if I had this is in vitro,</v>

2383
01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:38.031
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2384
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.170
<v Speaker 4>if I do it in vitro,</v>

2385
01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:39.770
<v Speaker 4>I take,</v>

2386
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.980
<v Speaker 4>if I take a cancer cell and I take away their glucose,</v>

2387
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but they still have all these glutamine,</v>

2388
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:46.640
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>

2389
01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:46.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2390
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 4>these other amino acids and that they were fine.</v>

2391
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:50.931
<v Speaker 4>They grow slower,</v>

2392
01:08:50.931 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 4>but they wouldn't die if I took away their glutamine,</v>

2393
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.420
<v Speaker 4>they would die within like 24 hours.</v>

2394
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:57.703
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2395
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2396
01:08:58.101 --> 01:08:59.660
<v Speaker 4>for me to think about cancer cells,</v>

2397
01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 4>well not only do they need energy,</v>

2398
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.203
<v Speaker 4>ATP,</v>

2399
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 4>they need nitrogen source to make new nucleotides for new DNA.</v>

2400
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 4>And also new amino acids.</v>

2401
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 4>They need molecules like to build lipids for lipid or you know,</v>

2402
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:11.810
<v Speaker 4>your lipid membrane.</v>

2403
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:12.690
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

2404
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.520
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2405
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.353
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of,</v>

2406
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.841
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2407
01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:15.141
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2408
01:09:15.141 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 4>just taking away the glucose is one thing.</v>

2409
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:18.410
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of other,</v>

2410
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2411
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 4>macromolecules that are really required for cancer proliferation that are also</v>

2412
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:25.034
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

2413
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:25.880
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2414
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2415
01:09:26.181 --> 01:09:26.811
<v Speaker 4>taking some,</v>

2416
01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:29.270
<v Speaker 4>it's taking some of the stuff that we're learning in science and immediately</v>

2417
01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 4>applying it I think in some cases can be a little dangerous.</v>

2418
01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:33.993
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2419
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2420
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 4>just because we don't exactly understand how all these mechanisms are working</v>

2421
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:38.924
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2422
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:43.930
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a little cautious about taking some something that we're learning in</v>

2423
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 4>science and immediately applying it to yourself,</v>

2424
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 4>especially if you have cancer.</v>

2425
01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 4>It's so fascinating.</v>

2426
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:49.911
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2427
01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:51.410
<v Speaker 4>if you think about like the last time I was here,</v>

2428
01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:53.000
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about the folic acid.</v>

2429
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:53.901
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2431
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:54.610
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2432
01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 4>and how that's,</v>

2433
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 4>that's a perfect example where folic acid is,</v>

2434
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 4>is great for you if you don't have cancer because you can build new DNA.</v>

2435
01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:03.140
<v Speaker 4>But if you have cancer,</v>

2436
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:06.650
<v Speaker 4>taking a lot of it is not great for you because you build new DNA and that's</v>

2437
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:08.120
<v Speaker 4>what cancer cells are doing when they're dividing.</v>

2438
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:09.343
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2439
01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:09.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2440
01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:10.310
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2441
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.850
<v Speaker 4>and there's another example of that with another micronutrient by one of the</v>

2442
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:14.684
<v Speaker 4>vitamin E's.</v>

2443
01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:15.801
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2444
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2445
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.180
<v Speaker 4>actually this would be a transition into,</v>

2446
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:23.510
<v Speaker 4>to some of the office and stuff cause he was talking about that specifically.</v>

2447
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:24.631
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2448
01:10:24.631 --> 01:10:25.061
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

2449
01:10:25.061 --> 01:10:25.741
<v Speaker 5>the doctor,</v>

2450
01:10:25.741 --> 01:10:26.930
<v Speaker 5>that stuff that I sent you.</v>

2451
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:27.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2452
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.021
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2453
01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:28.710
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2454
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:29.251
<v Speaker 5>so w,</v>

2455
01:10:29.251 --> 01:10:29.491
<v Speaker 5>w.</v>

2456
01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.190
<v Speaker 5>W we definitely get into that and I would love to in a moment,</v>

2457
01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.930
<v Speaker 5>so just to let everybody know,</v>

2458
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.221
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2459
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:35.100
<v Speaker 5>it seems,</v>

2460
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2461
01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.980
<v Speaker 5>if you're not interested in doing any of the research,</v>

2462
01:10:37.981 --> 01:10:42.780
<v Speaker 5>it seems that almost everyone who's done any research on this alkaline diet</v>

2463
01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:44.610
<v Speaker 5>thing says it's horseshit.</v>

2464
01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.480
<v Speaker 5>But they do say that these foods that they're suggesting that you eat to keep an</v>

2465
01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:53.850
<v Speaker 5>alkaline rich diet are very healthy for you.</v>

2466
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.350
<v Speaker 5>So in that sense,</v>

2467
01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.930
<v Speaker 5>it's good for you because it's going to provide your body with the nutrients</v>

2468
01:10:57.931 --> 01:10:58.764
<v Speaker 5>that it needs.</v>

2469
01:10:58.900 --> 01:10:59.160
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

2470
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.630
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're nutrient deficient,</v>

2471
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.070
<v Speaker 5>you're much more likely to be unhealthy.</v>

2472
01:11:02.071 --> 01:11:03.510
<v Speaker 5>If you're much more likely to be unhealthy,</v>

2473
01:11:03.511 --> 01:11:06.300
<v Speaker 5>your immune system's going to have a harder time dealing with any host of</v>

2474
01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:07.134
<v Speaker 5>different diseases.</v>

2475
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.230
<v Speaker 5>But that this alkaline thing of your body,</v>

2476
01:11:10.231 --> 01:11:15.231
<v Speaker 5>your body basically hovers between 7.3 and 7.45.</v>

2477
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Your stomach is very acidic with a Ph of 3.5 or below.</v>

2478
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 5>So it can break down food and your urine changes depending on what you eat and</v>

2479
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 5>that's how your body keeps the level and your body steady.</v>

2480
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

2481
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.760
<v Speaker 5>this idea that you're going to regulate the alkaline of your body with food and</v>

2482
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 5>that you're gonna keep your body in an alkaline state show.</v>

2483
01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:35.241
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2484
01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:39.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of low sort of like myths going on.</v>

2485
01:11:39.381 --> 01:11:39.741
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

2486
01:11:39.741 --> 01:11:43.430
<v Speaker 4>recently I think I saw on your Twitter you posted something,</v>

2487
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.761
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2488
01:11:43.761 --> 01:11:46.500
<v Speaker 4>a couple of days ago about Kale and uh,</v>

2489
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:47.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2490
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.930
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

2491
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:48.980
<v Speaker 4>it's really kind of,</v>

2492
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.860
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2493
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.540
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda there,</v>

2494
01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.810
<v Speaker 4>these people are doing more harm in the sentence and in some cases,</v>

2495
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.441
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2496
01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:55.274
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2497
01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:55.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2498
01:11:55.671 --> 01:11:56.504
<v Speaker 4>Kale,</v>

2499
01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Kale and the cruciferous family like Broccoli,</v>

2500
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:01.580
<v Speaker 4>cabbage,</v>

2501
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.241
<v Speaker 4>Brussel sprouts,</v>

2502
01:12:02.241 --> 01:12:03.000
<v Speaker 4>these things.</v>

2503
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:03.351
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2504
01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:06.830
<v Speaker 4>they have something in them called Glu Glucose and Oles.</v>

2505
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:07.491
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2506
01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:10.340
<v Speaker 4>And Glucose and all aids can get,</v>

2507
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.130
<v Speaker 4>could they get cleaved by an enzyme called myrosinase,</v>

2508
01:12:13.131 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 4>which is in the plant and it forms something called isothiocyanates in</v>

2509
01:12:17.331 --> 01:12:20.300
<v Speaker 4>isothiocyanates are very,</v>

2510
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2511
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:24.020
<v Speaker 4>they've been shown to be very potent anticancer agents.</v>

2512
01:12:24.021 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 4>So they activate the,</v>

2513
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:27.770
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a part of that for me since I was talking about,</v>

2514
01:12:27.771 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 4>because these are generated in the plant as a natural defense mechanisms.</v>

2515
01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.970
<v Speaker 4>It's one of their natural defense mechanism against bugs.</v>

2516
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 4>It's like a natural pesticide in innocence.</v>

2517
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.170
<v Speaker 4>They produce it to keep bugs away.</v>

2518
01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:43.220
<v Speaker 4>Isothiocyanates are for us,</v>

2519
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:47.180
<v Speaker 4>activate our variety of different genes that are involved in stress resistance,</v>

2520
01:12:47.181 --> 01:12:48.740
<v Speaker 4>including tumor suppressor genes,</v>

2521
01:12:48.741 --> 01:12:50.990
<v Speaker 4>which actually kill tumor cells.</v>

2522
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:52.123
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2523
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:52.911
<v Speaker 4>and they've shown this,</v>

2524
01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:53.630
<v Speaker 4>they've shown this,</v>

2525
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you know quite a few times that if you,</v>

2526
01:12:55.910 --> 01:13:00.910
<v Speaker 4>if you give mice like you know my SAP cancer isothiocyanates they will kill the</v>

2527
01:13:01.281 --> 01:13:06.281
<v Speaker 4>cancer cells and the whole isothiocyanates thing also compete competitively</v>

2528
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.290
<v Speaker 4>binds to,</v>

2529
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I had a the iodine transporter in the thyroid.</v>

2530
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 4>So here comes this whole,</v>

2531
01:13:14.031 --> 01:13:14.481
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2532
01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:16.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't eat kale because,</v>

2533
01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:21.580
<v Speaker 4>or cruciferous because it will screw up your thyroid and calls hyperthyroidism.</v>

2534
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2535
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 4>So the thing is though is these isothiocyanates they could,</v>

2536
01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.340
<v Speaker 4>they appear to competitively bind to the same transporter that iodine does to</v>

2537
01:13:31.341 --> 01:13:32.174
<v Speaker 4>get into the thyroid.</v>

2538
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.571
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2539
01:13:32.571 --> 01:13:36.710
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for the paper where they showed that and it's like 1948 because</v>

2540
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.530
<v Speaker 4>what I wanted to see was a dose dependent manner of giving them,</v>

2541
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:39.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2542
01:13:39.951 --> 01:13:43.580
<v Speaker 4>these isothiocyanates or Kale and show how much of it,</v>

2543
01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.001
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2544
01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:45.130
<v Speaker 4>competes it with iodine.</v>

2545
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:46.130
<v Speaker 4>How much do you know doesn't,</v>

2546
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.431
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2547
01:13:46.431 --> 01:13:47.660
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't get access to that paper.</v>

2548
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:51.470
<v Speaker 4>But what I did find is that when you give these mice isothiocyanates a lot of</v>

2549
01:13:51.471 --> 01:13:52.910
<v Speaker 4>them that kills cancer cells,</v>

2550
01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:54.470
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't cause any thyroid problems,</v>

2551
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.820
<v Speaker 4>which leads me to believe is that the Isis Ioc nights probably very,</v>

2552
01:13:58.821 --> 01:13:59.121
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2553
01:13:59.121 --> 01:14:04.121
<v Speaker 4>very small degree of a competitive inhibition of getting iodine into your</v>

2554
01:14:04.491 --> 01:14:05.240
<v Speaker 4>thyroid,</v>

2555
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.350
<v Speaker 4>which if you don't,</v>

2556
01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:06.981
<v Speaker 4>if you aren't low,</v>

2557
01:14:06.981 --> 01:14:09.830
<v Speaker 4>and I'd on wouldn't be a problem because you're not,</v>

2558
01:14:09.831 --> 01:14:10.220
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2559
01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 4>So if it's just very small amount of it,</v>

2560
01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 4>competing with it to get it to get iodine into the thyroid is not going to be a</v>

2561
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 4>problem unless you're really,</v>

2562
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 4>really deficient in iodine and then any small amount and you need,</v>

2563
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 4>so in my opinion,</v>

2564
01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 4>and for me,</v>

2565
01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:25.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2566
01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:25.191
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2567
01:14:25.191 --> 01:14:27.820
<v Speaker 4>so I love getting isothiocyanates from,</v>

2568
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:29.200
<v Speaker 4>from these cruciferous.</v>

2569
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.951
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

2570
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:34.340
<v Speaker 4>the enzyme myrosinase that converts that the glucose and all eights into isis</v>

2571
01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 4>thiocyanate is heat sensitive.</v>

2572
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:36.461
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2573
01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 4>so if you heat it,</v>

2574
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 4>it will generally inactivate it and not completely,</v>

2575
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.060
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't activate it for the most part.</v>

2576
01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:45.460
<v Speaker 4>And so you're not getting as many of those isothiocyanates,</v>

2577
01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 4>which is probably why people started to say,</v>

2578
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:47.561
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2579
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:48.394
<v Speaker 4>boil your,</v>

2580
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>boil your Kale.</v>

2581
01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

2582
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2583
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:55.290
<v Speaker 4>I personally want the isothiocyanates because the data is so strong showing that</v>

2584
01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 4>these things kill cancer cells.</v>

2585
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:57.841
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2586
01:14:57.841 --> 01:14:57.991
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2587
01:14:57.991 --> 01:15:00.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a well known fact that these things sold.</v>

2588
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:05.750
<v Speaker 4>This idea that raw kale or any of these Rah Rah.</v>

2589
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.593
<v Speaker 4>There's another one,</v>

2590
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:09.700
<v Speaker 4>there's Brussel sprouts,</v>

2591
01:15:09.701 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 4>but then there's another,</v>

2592
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 4>so that's that story about the height of that.</v>

2593
01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:14.340
<v Speaker 4>Those are bad for you.</v>

2594
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Seems as bullshit.</v>

2595
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.511
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2596
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:16.661
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2597
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:17.231
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm just,</v>

2598
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2599
01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 4>to me it,</v>

2600
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2601
01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.300
<v Speaker 4>hormesis okay.</v>

2602
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what you're defining as bad for you are saying for me since it's</v>

2603
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:27.850
<v Speaker 4>activating a bunch of genes that are tumor suppressor genes that kill cancer</v>

2604
01:15:27.851 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>

2605
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's good for you,</v>

2606
01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 4>these isothiocyanates or good,</v>

2607
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 4>good for you if you don't,</v>

2608
01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:34.240
<v Speaker 4>if you're not like completely deficient in iodine,</v>

2609
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:35.590
<v Speaker 4>which most people aren't.</v>

2610
01:15:35.591 --> 01:15:39.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that there's some problem with women in their twenties or forties</v>

2611
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:44.380
<v Speaker 4>but supplemented iodine while you were taking these ISO thiocyanate</v>

2612
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 4>sinaits they're very,</v>

2613
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 4>I've been talking about these for years.</v>

2614
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Like how awesome they,</v>

2615
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:52.603
<v Speaker 4>I want them.</v>

2616
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Like I want them in my bottom.</v>

2617
01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:55.870
<v Speaker 4>I want my eyes to that.</v>

2618
01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it so I'm telling you.</v>

2619
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.541
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

2620
01:15:58.541 --> 01:15:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>

2621
01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.073
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2622
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.931
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2623
01:16:01.931 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2624
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 4>cause they're fucking awesome.</v>

2625
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

2626
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:07.810
<v Speaker 4>it kind of irks me because I'm like,</v>

2627
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 4>I see all this stuff and it's like,</v>

2628
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:10.243
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2629
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 4>don't not,</v>

2630
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2631
01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.980
<v Speaker 4>there's still not eat your raw kale because you,</v>

2632
01:16:13.981 --> 01:16:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you want to get things like ice.</v>

2633
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.863
<v Speaker 4>Who thought he was saying there's,</v>

2634
01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 4>there's chemicals in these plants that are,</v>

2635
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:18.191
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2636
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:18.730
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2637
01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:19.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2638
01:16:19.271 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 4>they're slightly toxic,</v>

2639
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:25.960
<v Speaker 4>but they're inducing stress response mechanisms in our body that are good for</v>

2640
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:26.321
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2641
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 4>They're fighting off all that,</v>

2642
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 4>all the bad stuff that we're making in our body.</v>

2643
01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Everything,</v>

2644
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2645
01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:30.551
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2646
01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a good thing.</v>

2647
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Precancerous cells are always happening.</v>

2648
01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.780
<v Speaker 4>You want tumor suppressor genes are genes that when there's something's wrong,</v>

2649
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:38.800
<v Speaker 4>like you have,</v>

2650
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.090
<v Speaker 4>you get that DNA damage.</v>

2651
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about something happens where a mutation happens in a cell,</v>

2652
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:44.403
<v Speaker 4>it senses it,</v>

2653
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2654
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:48.070
<v Speaker 4>and it activates this whole response pathway where it's like dye and it kills</v>

2655
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:48.904
<v Speaker 4>the cell.</v>

2656
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 4>So having something that activates those pathways in your body,</v>

2657
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:54.280
<v Speaker 4>like isothiocyanates is a good thing.</v>

2658
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:54.910
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2659
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:55.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2660
01:16:55.271 --> 01:16:55.441
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2661
01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:57.290
<v Speaker 4>and personally I want more of them.</v>

2662
01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:02.490
<v Speaker 4>So all this stuff about this poorly researched bad conclusions.</v>

2663
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2664
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.150
<v Speaker 4>so the thing is,</v>

2665
01:17:06.151 --> 01:17:07.360
<v Speaker 4>is when you look at the,</v>

2666
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.680
<v Speaker 4>when you look in the literature,</v>

2667
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:09.733
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2668
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2669
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:11.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2670
01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2671
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to look at the effects of Isis,</v>

2672
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I sign it's on thyroid function.</v>

2673
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 4>There's not a whole huge literature on it.</v>

2674
01:17:18.861 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

2675
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for the experiment to prove to me.</v>

2676
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to see how much competitive inhibition there was.</v>

2677
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I think they're also called icy threes.</v>

2678
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I see threes on the iodine transport and the thyroid.</v>

2679
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find it.</v>

2680
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 4>I'd say I'll review articles where they referred to it.</v>

2681
01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 4>I looked to the reference,</v>

2682
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 4>go to the reference.</v>

2683
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:35.421
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2684
01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:35.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2685
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:36.650
<v Speaker 4>it's some other reviewer.</v>

2686
01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:37.490
<v Speaker 4>It's just there's no,</v>

2687
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 4>I want it to see the data.</v>

2688
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 4>And I had to dig,</v>

2689
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 4>dig until I got to 1948 where they did this competitive binding essay.</v>

2690
01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:45.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2691
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 4>and then I found other papers talking about,</v>

2692
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:48.831
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2693
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 4>it's only an effect if you have low iodine.</v>

2694
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.000
<v Speaker 4>Which made me think,</v>

2695
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2696
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.770
<v Speaker 4>I can't see the data.</v>

2697
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.800
<v Speaker 4>But what I think makes sense is that only if it's such a low competitive</v>

2698
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:01.214
<v Speaker 4>binding,</v>

2699
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.113
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2700
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:02.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2701
01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 4>it's not like if you eat this,</v>

2702
01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna not get iodine.</v>

2703
01:18:05.331 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 4>It's that if you already are at that point where you don't have it any little</v>

2704
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:09.591
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

2705
01:18:09.591 --> 01:18:10.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't get,</v>

2706
01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 4>makes a difference.</v>

2707
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.871
<v Speaker 4>And I know,</v>

2708
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.190
<v Speaker 4>and I know this because the mice,</v>

2709
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 4>the mouse models where they're not even looking at thyroid function and they're</v>

2710
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 4>looking at the effects of isothiocyanates and killing cancer cells,</v>

2711
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.880
<v Speaker 4>those minds have no problems with becoming hyperthyroid and they're giving them</v>

2712
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:23.720
<v Speaker 4>large doses.</v>

2713
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:24.651
<v Speaker 4>So to me I'm like,</v>

2714
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:24.921
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2715
01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 4>well that would have been a side effect.</v>

2716
01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:27.044
<v Speaker 4>They would've noticed,</v>

2717
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2718
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 4>so this is just completely theoretical and it doesn't work.</v>

2719
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work in practice.</v>

2720
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:35.620
<v Speaker 4>What does this idea of getting hypothyroidism from?</v>

2721
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.060
<v Speaker 4>I think if you have normal levels of iodine,</v>

2722
01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 4>it's fine,</v>

2723
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

2724
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 4>But if you're,</v>

2725
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're like one of those people that is iodine deficient,</v>

2726
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.941
<v Speaker 4>it may,</v>

2727
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:45.740
<v Speaker 4>it may affect you because if it,</v>

2728
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:45.891
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2729
01:18:45.891 --> 01:18:46.121
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2730
01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.730
<v Speaker 4>if there's a small amount of it,</v>

2731
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 4>it does seem to compete with iodine transport,</v>

2732
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:55.140
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's a very small competitive amount.</v>

2733
01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:55.950
<v Speaker 4>It's not a,</v>

2734
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not like all the iodine,</v>

2735
01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not like all or nothing like all of it's getting in or not getting in.</v>

2736
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a very small amount that doesn't get in.</v>

2737
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:03.171
<v Speaker 4>But if you're not,</v>

2738
01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:03.291
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2739
01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 4>if you're getting your iodine and you know,</v>

2740
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:05.714
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

2741
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 4>does that,</v>

2742
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:07.723
<v Speaker 4>are you following?</v>

2743
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:08.821
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2744
01:19:08.821 --> 01:19:13.130
<v Speaker 4>so that I hope people can follow that because I really,</v>

2745
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.380
<v Speaker 4>there's so much of that horse these days.</v>

2746
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.280
<v Speaker 4>There's so much contrarianism to so many people that want to debunk anything</v>

2747
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:20.300
<v Speaker 4>that comes to thing.</v>

2748
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.430
<v Speaker 4>And the other one is this oxalic acid.</v>

2749
01:19:22.431 --> 01:19:24.690
<v Speaker 4>I think you've kind of confuse the two.</v>

2750
01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:27.170
<v Speaker 4>But that was the one that Dave Asprey had talked about.</v>

2751
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:27.321
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

2752
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Why does with Kale,</v>

2753
01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:30.590
<v Speaker 4>that's why I brought that up.</v>

2754
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Kale.</v>

2755
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.033
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2756
01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:35.410
<v Speaker 4>you had a boil Kale because of oxalic acid and during the war.</v>

2757
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 4>And let me tell you about that.</v>

2758
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2759
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 4>the oxalic acid,</v>

2760
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a little bit in Kale,</v>

2761
01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.380
<v Speaker 4>but it's mostly in spinach,</v>

2762
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.933
<v Speaker 4>oxalic acids,</v>

2763
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
<v Speaker 4>and spent most the highest and the what people are saying on the Internet from</v>

2764
01:19:50.721 --> 01:19:54.830
<v Speaker 4>what I could see on this whole echo chamber thing that happens is that you need</v>

2765
01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:55.940
<v Speaker 4>to boil your spinach.</v>

2766
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess it were in some people they're saying Kale.</v>

2767
01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2768
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.700
<v Speaker 4>because then you're going to inactivate this oxalic acid and now it's not going</v>

2769
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 4>to bind up minerals like magnesium,</v>

2770
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:07.883
<v Speaker 4>calcium,</v>

2771
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.620
<v Speaker 4>and they're saying that this is a problem if you don't do this,</v>

2772
01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:12.330
<v Speaker 4>because then you're going to get kidney stones.</v>

2773
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2774
01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:18.320
<v Speaker 4>So I was looking in the literature and I found a really cool experiment done by</v>

2775
01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 4>this Japanese group where they took spinach,</v>

2776
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 4>raw spinach.</v>

2777
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:24.000
<v Speaker 4>They boiled it,</v>

2778
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:24.960
<v Speaker 4>they fried it,</v>

2779
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 4>they frizzled it.</v>

2780
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.461
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2781
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:27.001
<v Speaker 4>so they did,</v>

2782
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:27.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2783
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 4>various different temperatures and they,</v>

2784
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2785
01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 4>then you make it into a powder to give to these mice that are magnesium</v>

2786
01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:33.380
<v Speaker 4>deficient.</v>

2787
01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.810
<v Speaker 4>They may put them on a magnesium deficient diet and they fed them either the raw</v>

2788
01:20:36.811 --> 01:20:37.321
<v Speaker 4>spinach,</v>

2789
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:37.891
<v Speaker 4>the boil,</v>

2790
01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 4>the Frizzell fried,</v>

2791
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 4>and they measured magnesium levels in their blood and their bone.</v>

2792
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:47.760
<v Speaker 4>And they measured a calcium levels in their blood and bone and also in their</v>

2793
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:48.594
<v Speaker 4>kidneys.</v>

2794
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600
<v Speaker 4>And what they found was that there was no difference in the magnesium and</v>

2795
01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 4>calcium levels and the bone,</v>

2796
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.820
<v Speaker 4>and also in the serum it,</v>

2797
01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.480
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you boiled Raul Fried,</v>

2798
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:00.751
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2799
01:21:00.751 --> 01:21:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Frizzled uh,</v>

2800
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.513
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

2801
01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2802
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:03.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2803
01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.051
<v Speaker 4>it counts.</v>

2804
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:05.190
<v Speaker 4>The calcium levels there were,</v>

2805
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.440
<v Speaker 4>there was a difference from frying it or frizzling it,</v>

2806
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 4>but the raw and the boiling were the same.</v>

2807
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Speaker 4>And basically the conclusions were it doesn't effect absorption,</v>

2808
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:13.681
<v Speaker 4>boiling or raw.</v>

2809
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:14.514
<v Speaker 4>It's the same.</v>

2810
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 4>You're going to absorb the same amount of magnesium,</v>

2811
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 4>calcium,</v>

2812
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.880
<v Speaker 4>there were magnesium and calcium in the kidney that did have him in the kidney</v>

2813
01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:23.580
<v Speaker 4>and it was a little bit higher concentrated versus the control,</v>

2814
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.830
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't causing,</v>

2815
01:21:26.831 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2816
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.980
<v Speaker 4>kidney stones and things like that.</v>

2817
01:21:28.981 --> 01:21:30.630
<v Speaker 4>And there was no difference between boiling or not.</v>

2818
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.910
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to make the claim that,</v>

2819
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:33.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2820
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:38.190
<v Speaker 4>having oxalic acid causes kidney stones and you need to boil it,</v>

2821
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 4>well maybe just there may be,</v>

2822
01:21:40.621 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 4>you need to say don't eat it,</v>

2823
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:42.930
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's the case.</v>

2824
01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't think any of that's the case.</v>

2825
01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:46.340
<v Speaker 4>So having a look soggy,</v>

2826
01:21:46.341 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 4>I assume your diet from consuming it in raw form,</v>

2827
01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:50.250
<v Speaker 4>not bad.</v>

2828
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 4>I think it's it.</v>

2829
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to consume a massive,</v>

2830
01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.340
<v Speaker 4>massive amount to cause something that would be like kidney stones.</v>

2831
01:21:59.520 --> 01:21:59.911
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

2832
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 4>Like eating it every day all day?</v>

2833
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2834
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean like eating like,</v>

2835
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:06.840
<v Speaker 4>like pounds,</v>

2836
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 4>pounds of it a day.</v>

2837
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:08.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2838
01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

2839
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2840
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.073
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

2841
01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 4>So that's beautiful.</v>

2842
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2843
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm not here.</v>

2844
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.723
<v Speaker 4>Here's the violence.</v>

2845
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:19.750
<v Speaker 4>I have not convinced myself that I have to boil any of my spinach or kale before</v>

2846
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:21.120
<v Speaker 4>I eat it raw.</v>

2847
01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.601
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

2848
01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:23.400
<v Speaker 4>I actually put it in a smoothie every morning.</v>

2849
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 4>I make a smoothie with Kale,</v>

2850
01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:25.681
<v Speaker 4>raw kale,</v>

2851
01:22:25.681 --> 01:22:26.514
<v Speaker 4>raw spinach,</v>

2852
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.211
<v Speaker 4>tomato,</v>

2853
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:28.044
<v Speaker 4>carrot,</v>

2854
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.861
<v Speaker 4>a avocado,</v>

2855
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:29.221
<v Speaker 4>banana,</v>

2856
01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:29.970
<v Speaker 4>almond milk,</v>

2857
01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:30.631
<v Speaker 4>some berries,</v>

2858
01:22:30.631 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 4>and it's protein powder as well.</v>

2859
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

2860
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I haven't convinced myself that eating raw spinach in my smoothies every day,</v>

2861
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:38.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2862
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.361
<v Speaker 4>and I put it,</v>

2863
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:39.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2864
01:22:39.601 --> 01:22:40.620
<v Speaker 4>I put a nice amount of it.</v>

2865
01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:42.001
<v Speaker 4>It's not pounds of it,</v>

2866
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:42.834
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2867
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:43.723
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2868
01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:46.980
<v Speaker 4>I haven't convinced myself that I'm doing any harm.</v>

2869
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.010
<v Speaker 4>And this is obviously not just based on the way your body reacts,</v>

2870
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 4>but based on the research that you've done.</v>

2871
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.660
<v Speaker 4>This is based on the,</v>

2872
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:52.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2873
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 4>the little bit of reading that I've done on,</v>

2874
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.610
<v Speaker 4>on those,</v>

2875
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:56.580
<v Speaker 4>the isothiocyanates,</v>

2876
01:22:56.581 --> 01:22:57.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely convinced that,</v>

2877
01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2878
01:22:58.351 --> 01:22:58.581
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2879
01:22:58.581 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 4>the oxalic acid,</v>

2880
01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:00.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2881
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 4>because it does bind minerals.</v>

2882
01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:03.144
<v Speaker 4>It's key later.</v>

2883
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:04.163
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2884
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2885
01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 4>there may some cases where kidney,</v>

2886
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:07.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2887
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:09.280
<v Speaker 4>can accumulate in the kidney.</v>

2888
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 4>But I think that from what,</v>

2889
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 4>from my reading that's really,</v>

2890
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 4>really large dose and I haven't convinced myself yet.</v>

2891
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying it's not possible,</v>

2892
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't convinced myself that I need to worry about it.</v>

2893
01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:25.160
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that you're getting some sort of toxins from the vegetables because</v>

2894
01:23:25.161 --> 01:23:27.230
<v Speaker 5>the vegetables are trying to prevent predation,</v>

2895
01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.770
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2896
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:28.603
<v Speaker 5>Nonsense.</v>

2897
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:29.570
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2898
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 4>you aren't getting taught,</v>

2899
01:23:30.491 --> 01:23:32.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean nonsense that it's bad for you.</v>

2900
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2901
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:33.720
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2902
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.553
<v Speaker 4>there's the,</v>

2903
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:36.050
<v Speaker 4>they're activating for Musa,</v>

2904
01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:37.490
<v Speaker 4>so it is kind of toxic for you.</v>

2905
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:38.271
<v Speaker 4>It kinda,</v>

2906
01:23:38.271 --> 01:23:38.731
<v Speaker 4>it's odd,</v>

2907
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:42.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's an intubating stress response pathways that are ultimately,</v>

2908
01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2909
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:44.120
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2910
01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.480
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of bad for you activating a pathway really,</v>

2911
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:48.740
<v Speaker 4>really good for you because now you're,</v>

2912
01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:53.330
<v Speaker 4>now you're turning on hundreds of genes that are involved in DNA repair,</v>

2913
01:23:53.331 --> 01:23:55.550
<v Speaker 4>that are involved in glutathione peroxidase,</v>

2914
01:23:55.551 --> 01:23:57.380
<v Speaker 4>getting rid of oxidation that are involved in,</v>

2915
01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:57.861
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2916
01:23:57.861 --> 01:23:58.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2917
01:23:58.161 --> 01:23:58.581
<v Speaker 4>making,</v>

2918
01:23:58.581 --> 01:23:59.414
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2919
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.520
<v Speaker 4>making sure cancer cells die.</v>

2920
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 4>So to me,</v>

2921
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2922
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:06.140
<v Speaker 4>you are getting a little bit of these toxins from these plants.</v>

2923
01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2924
01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.650
<v Speaker 4>But your body's counteracting of these toxins,</v>

2925
01:24:09.651 --> 01:24:10.930
<v Speaker 4>body's incredibly beneficial.</v>

2926
01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.890
<v Speaker 4>Your body is increased.</v>

2927
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2928
01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:13.490
<v Speaker 4>your body's pretty amazing.</v>

2929
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2930
01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.440
<v Speaker 4>and it is pretty beneficial,</v>

2931
01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.490
<v Speaker 4>the reaction to,</v>

2932
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:17.480
<v Speaker 4>to some of these toxins.</v>

2933
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 5>So the point being that the incorrect correlation that people have made between</v>

2934
01:24:21.191 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 5>the very low toxicity between these,</v>

2935
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:24.274
<v Speaker 5>these plants,</v>

2936
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.031
<v Speaker 5>Kale,</v>

2937
01:24:25.031 --> 01:24:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Broccoli,</v>

2938
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:26.590
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2939
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:30.340
<v Speaker 5>and them being something that you should avoid consuming once you boil them.</v>

2940
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.600
<v Speaker 5>That's just not,</v>

2941
01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:31.680
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2942
01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.490
<v Speaker 4>in mine,</v>

2943
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:33.450
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

2944
01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:34.440
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make sense.</v>

2945
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense.</v>

2946
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense to me either.</v>

2947
01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:41.160
<v Speaker 4>So I think people can take something little and it becomes this sensational and</v>

2948
01:24:41.161 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

2949
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.791
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2950
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:45.360
<v Speaker 4>it's very sensational because what's good for you is bad for you.</v>

2951
01:24:45.361 --> 01:24:46.620
<v Speaker 4>But if you do this little thing,</v>

2952
01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.120
<v Speaker 4>it becomes good for you again.</v>

2953
01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:52.290
<v Speaker 4>And I think that it's a good marketing tactic in some respects.</v>

2954
01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:52.891
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2955
01:24:52.891 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Where there is right is</v>

2956
01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:54.431
<v Speaker 5>one case,</v>

2957
01:24:54.431 --> 01:24:55.660
<v Speaker 5>there's a study,</v>

2958
01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:55.990
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2959
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:59.350
<v Speaker 5>that you could find on a pub med site about excelling.</v>

2960
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:00.650
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2961
01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:05.230
<v Speaker 5>Oxalate Nefro Pathi due to juicing.</v>

2962
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:06.071
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2963
01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:06.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2964
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:11.310
<v Speaker 5>this patient with a Oxley induced acute renal failure that was attributable to a</v>

2965
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:17.881
<v Speaker 5>consumption of oxalate rich fruit and vegetable juices obtained from juicing.</v>

2966
01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:19.121
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2967
01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:23.140
<v Speaker 5>we described the case and also review the clinical presentation of 65 patients</v>

2968
01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 5>seen at the Mayo clinic in Rochester,</v>

2969
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:29.791
<v Speaker 5>Minnesota from 1985 through 2010 with renal failure and biopsy proven renal</v>

2970
01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 5>calcium oxalate crystals.</v>

2971
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.170
<v Speaker 5>The cause of Reno Auc.</v>

2972
01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Solo sis was identified for all patients,</v>

2973
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:43.530
<v Speaker 5>a single cause for 36 patients and at least two causes for 29 patients.</v>

2974
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:44.831
<v Speaker 5>Three patients,</v>

2975
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:49.831
<v Speaker 5>including our index patient had presumed diet induced oxalate and nef.</v>

2976
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:51.161
<v Speaker 5>How do you say that word?</v>

2977
01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:52.540
<v Speaker 5>Nephropathy.</v>

2978
01:25:52.541 --> 01:25:53.231
<v Speaker 5>Nephropathy.</v>

2979
01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:54.064
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2980
01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 5>In the context of chronic kidney disease,</v>

2981
01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:57.281
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2982
01:25:57.281 --> 01:26:02.281
<v Speaker 5>identification of calcium oxalate crystals in a kidney biopsy should prompt an</v>

2983
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.220
<v Speaker 5>evaluation for causes</v>

2984
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.380
<v Speaker 2>of renal oxaloacetate be blea.</v>

2985
01:26:06.381 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 2>Blea blea um,</v>

2986
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:08.990
<v Speaker 2>so what does that mean?</v>

2987
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:10.071
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2988
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:11.690
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like there are these people,</v>

2989
01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:12.710
<v Speaker 2>how many of them were the,</v>

2990
01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:13.544
<v Speaker 2>that had the,</v>

2991
01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2992
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 2>from the juicing,</v>

2993
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2994
01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

2995
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:21.670
<v Speaker 2>65 patients from 1985 to 2010 this time.</v>

2996
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:23.960
<v Speaker 2>And to have 65 patients.</v>

2997
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:29.110
<v Speaker 2>And all of them actually single costs for 36 patients and at least two causes</v>

2998
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 2>for 29 patients too because they were all so,</v>

2999
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:34.011
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3000
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>the single cause for the 36 patients they believe was juicing</v>

3001
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.431
<v Speaker 2>is juicing.</v>

3002
01:26:39.431 --> 01:26:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3003
01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.281
<v Speaker 2>And the other one,</v>

3004
01:26:40.281 --> 01:26:41.190
<v Speaker 2>there's two causes.</v>

3005
01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:41.561
<v Speaker 2>Any of them,</v>

3006
01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:42.340
<v Speaker 2>there's two causes.</v>

3007
01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>So about three.</v>

3008
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3009
01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 2>So to me it sounds like,</v>

3010
01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:46.791
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3011
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:47.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:47.924
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3013
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be cases where you can't,</v>

3014
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.021
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

3015
01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:56.021
<v Speaker 2>you can probably caused that to happen because it does bind and collate these</v>

3016
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:57.230
<v Speaker 2>ions,</v>

3017
01:26:57.230 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 2>especially in juicing perhaps because you're taking us such a large quantity of</v>

3018
01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:04.160
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and breaking them down to a juice.</v>

3019
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Would that make sense?</v>

3020
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Get more oxalate?</v>

3021
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.513
<v Speaker 2>Maybe so.</v>

3022
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.391
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3023
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:08.860
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3024
01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3025
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 2>cause like if you juice,</v>

3026
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.061
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3027
01:27:11.061 --> 01:27:14.630
<v Speaker 2>think about like what are like a 16 ounce glass of juice,</v>

3028
01:27:14.631 --> 01:27:19.631
<v Speaker 2>how many vegetables have to go into the juicer to liquefy it down to,</v>

3029
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I make smoothies for the most part,</v>

3030
01:27:23.601 --> 01:27:24.434
<v Speaker 2>I don't juice.</v>

3031
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3032
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3033
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 2>occasionally I buy a cold press juices,</v>

3034
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.821
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3035
01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:29.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3036
01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm most of what I do,</v>

3037
01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I'd just be like me,</v>

3038
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't use either.</v>

3039
01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3040
01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I've actually have not ever juiced.</v>

3041
01:27:34.821 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I make smoothies as well.</v>

3042
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:37.250
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3043
01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:38.230
<v Speaker 2>there I,</v>

3044
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 2>it sounds to me like there can be cases where you're getting a really</v>

3045
01:27:41.271 --> 01:27:43.280
<v Speaker 2>concentrated amount of this and you're doing it everyday.</v>

3046
01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's people out there that go extreme and no matter what they do,</v>

3047
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:49.550
<v Speaker 2>they go like to the extreme.</v>

3048
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:50.601
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3049
01:27:50.601 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 2>because you can,</v>

3050
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:52.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3051
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:52.971
<v Speaker 2>the x,</v>

3052
01:27:52.971 --> 01:27:54.520
<v Speaker 2>the axilla catheter XL,</v>

3053
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:55.610
<v Speaker 2>the anti and of it,</v>

3054
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 2>the oxalate can bind,</v>

3055
01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>does bind to these metal ions at key lates than men.</v>

3056
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3057
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely could accumulate in your kidney.</v>

3058
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3059
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:04.363
<v Speaker 2>but you would,</v>

3060
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.110
<v Speaker 2>so the real key is the thing that we've always been taught to eat a balanced</v>

3061
01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:09.920
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

3062
01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I think most people are not going to that extreme.</v>

3063
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3064
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think most people have to be under a fear that they can't eat raw</v>

3065
01:28:17.321 --> 01:28:18.830
<v Speaker 2>spent spot raw Spanish.</v>

3066
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:19.491
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3067
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there you need to fear eating Ross badge.</v>

3068
01:28:22.341 --> 01:28:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe just don't be a dumb ass and like,</v>

3069
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3070
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.931
<v Speaker 2>go way,</v>

3071
01:28:26.931 --> 01:28:27.231
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3072
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:28.190
<v Speaker 2>way overboard.</v>

3073
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3074
01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3075
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:30.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3076
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 2>eating some raw juices is probably really good for you.</v>

3077
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Eating nothing but raw juices all day,</v>

3078
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>all your life.</v>

3079
01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:38.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not so good for you.</v>

3080
01:28:38.721 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 2>You need animal protein or some other things and yeah.</v>

3081
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3082
01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3083
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 2>there was another guy I know of a guy who,</v>

3084
01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3085
01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Brock Lesnar was actually the UFC heavyweight champion who eat nothing but meat.</v>

3086
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.280
<v Speaker 2>He was a fucking crazy person and he got diverticulitis and he had to get a 12</v>

3087
01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:56.690
<v Speaker 2>inches of his colon removed.</v>

3088
01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Pretty serious operation.</v>

3089
01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.130
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting that some,</v>

3090
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3091
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3092
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much of a degree this is dose dependent,</v>

3093
01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:05.500
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3094
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3095
01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:10.940
<v Speaker 4>there's bacteria in your gut called purification bacteria and they called that</v>

3096
01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 4>because of the bacteria that make that really nasty smelling fart.</v>

3097
01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like hydrogen sulfide.</v>

3098
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 4>So I was like pure hydrogen sulfide and those bacteria,</v>

3099
01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:22.320
<v Speaker 4>the purification bacteria,</v>

3100
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.240
<v Speaker 4>they actually use,</v>

3101
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:24.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3102
01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:27.570
<v Speaker 4>like sulfate and nitrate as their source of energy.</v>

3103
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:29.100
<v Speaker 4>And they convert it into like,</v>

3104
01:29:29.101 --> 01:29:29.461
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

3105
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen sulfide,</v>

3106
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.040
<v Speaker 4>but they need,</v>

3107
01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:32.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3108
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:32.641
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3109
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:33.141
<v Speaker 4>so it's the,</v>

3110
01:29:33.141 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 4>it's basically what we do with oxygen.</v>

3111
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.460
<v Speaker 4>They do that with these sulfate and they,</v>

3112
01:29:37.461 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 4>they make it into hydrogen sulfide.</v>

3113
01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 4>It's like us converting oxygen to water.</v>

3114
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:41.430
<v Speaker 4>That's how we make ATP.</v>

3115
01:29:41.431 --> 01:29:45.390
<v Speaker 4>They do this by converting sulfate into hydrogen sulfide,</v>

3116
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:46.111
<v Speaker 4>announce their energy,</v>

3117
01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:47.640
<v Speaker 4>this nutrification bacteria.</v>

3118
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:48.001
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3119
01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:48.450
<v Speaker 4>they need,</v>

3120
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:49.283
<v Speaker 4>they need these,</v>

3121
01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.293
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3122
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I guess cofactors to do this.</v>

3123
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.083
<v Speaker 4>And that's heme.</v>

3124
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 4>Heme is in red meat.</v>

3125
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:57.360
<v Speaker 4>And so some people that you really,</v>

3126
01:29:57.361 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 4>really large doses of red meat,</v>

3127
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.850
<v Speaker 4>like what happens is you're giving those bacteria heme and they start to make</v>

3128
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.940
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen sulfide.</v>

3129
01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:07.260
<v Speaker 4>And the thing with hydrogen sulfite,</v>

3130
01:30:07.261 --> 01:30:07.621
<v Speaker 4>so y'all met,</v>

3131
01:30:07.621 --> 01:30:07.951
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3132
01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:09.660
<v Speaker 4>you get future occasion of bacteria,</v>

3133
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:12.870
<v Speaker 4>so you'll have nasty smelling farts like hydrogen sulfite farts.</v>

3134
01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3135
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:18.800
<v Speaker 4>and also hydrogen sulfide combat competitively competitively binds to enzymes in</v>

3136
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 4>our guts cells that make energy.</v>

3137
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:23.551
<v Speaker 4>So they actually,</v>

3138
01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:24.600
<v Speaker 4>so it goes,</v>

3139
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:26.490
<v Speaker 4>hydrogen sulfide goes and binds to these,</v>

3140
01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.513
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3141
01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 4>electron transport chain enzymes that make ATP in our gut cells and</v>

3142
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:36.590
<v Speaker 4>competitively inhibits them from actually being able to reduce oxygen to water</v>

3143
01:30:36.841 --> 01:30:37.561
<v Speaker 4>to make ATP.</v>

3144
01:30:37.561 --> 01:30:38.221
<v Speaker 4>So then your guts,</v>

3145
01:30:38.221 --> 01:30:42.690
<v Speaker 4>Dell start to like starve down there and starts to break down the gut mucous</v>

3146
01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:43.643
<v Speaker 4>barrier.</v>

3147
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:44.401
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

3148
01:30:44.401 --> 01:30:48.510
<v Speaker 4>it's totally a tangent and I don't know how I got on that.</v>

3149
01:30:48.511 --> 01:30:49.290
<v Speaker 4>I guess the meat,</v>

3150
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:49.641
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3151
01:30:49.641 --> 01:30:50.140
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3152
01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.020
<v Speaker 4>the high meat diet,</v>

3153
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:51.391
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3154
01:30:51.391 --> 01:30:54.720
<v Speaker 1>So the diverticulitis that people got from eating only meat.</v>

3155
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3156
01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:56.461
<v Speaker 1>So like I said,</v>

3157
01:30:56.461 --> 01:30:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a dose,</v>

3158
01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3159
01:30:58.081 --> 01:30:58.914
<v Speaker 1>really just dependent</v>

3160
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.450
<v Speaker 4>cause eating a little bit of meat.</v>

3161
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:02.381
<v Speaker 4>It depends.</v>

3162
01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:02.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3163
01:31:02.531 --> 01:31:02.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3164
01:31:02.741 --> 01:31:03.311
<v Speaker 4>your own body,</v>

3165
01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:05.800
<v Speaker 4>if you're eating tons of meat and you started smelling these hydrogen sulfide</v>

3166
01:31:05.801 --> 01:31:06.634
<v Speaker 4>smart farts,</v>

3167
01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:07.753
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

3168
01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3169
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

3170
01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

3171
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you smell a guy as far,</v>

3172
01:31:11.921 --> 01:31:12.411
<v Speaker 1>you might die.</v>

3173
01:31:12.411 --> 01:31:12.980
<v Speaker 1>You should talk to,</v>

3174
01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

3175
01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3176
01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not the kind of Fart that,</v>

3177
01:31:15.411 --> 01:31:15.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3178
01:31:15.651 --> 01:31:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

3179
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:17.030
<v Speaker 1>it's the pure,</v>

3180
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.433
<v Speaker 1>those ones that are like,</v>

3181
01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:19.430
<v Speaker 1>oh good God.</v>

3182
01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3183
01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.421
<v Speaker 1>it's that.</v>

3184
01:31:20.421 --> 01:31:21.254
<v Speaker 1>It's that one.</v>

3185
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:23.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3186
01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Stuff's going on.</v>

3187
01:31:23.901 --> 01:31:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3188
01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Those are bodybuilding farts.</v>

3189
01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:29.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're on and they eat a lot of red meat.</v>

3190
01:31:29.241 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3191
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Do they just won't buy a lot of protein,</v>

3192
01:31:31.371 --> 01:31:31.881
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

3193
01:31:31.881 --> 01:31:32.290
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3194
01:31:32.290 --> 01:31:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Does it affect all other types of proteins?</v>

3195
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3196
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:35.930
<v Speaker 1>him his,</v>

3197
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:37.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's what gives red meat the red color.</v>

3198
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3199
01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's specific to red meat.</v>

3200
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:41.450
<v Speaker 1>So the more red meat,</v>

3201
01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.070
<v Speaker 1>the more horrible forest,</v>

3202
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:44.210
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

3203
01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:45.110
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

3204
01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3205
01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:46.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3206
01:31:46.361 --> 01:31:46.940
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

3207
01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who do you think about having the worst farts?</v>

3208
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It's always guys with big guts.</v>

3209
01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:51.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3210
01:31:51.621 --> 01:31:53.180
<v Speaker 1>like if someone farts on an airplane,</v>

3211
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you always look at the guy with the gut.</v>

3212
01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to figure out who's farting on an airplane.</v>

3213
01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons people are so sneaky</v>

3214
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.903
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

3215
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 5>Sneaky airplane,</v>

3216
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:02.510
<v Speaker 5>foreigners.</v>

3217
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:03.343
<v Speaker 5>He know who you are.</v>

3218
01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 5>But the guys with the big guts,</v>

3219
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:06.520
<v Speaker 5>they're usually the culprit.</v>

3220
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:07.200
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3221
01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:07.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3222
01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3223
01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:08.860
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3224
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.450
<v Speaker 5>it's the beautification bacteria.</v>

3225
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Putrid vacation bacteria.</v>

3226
01:32:11.591 --> 01:32:11.771
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3227
01:32:11.771 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 5>they're named for a reason and they're,</v>

3228
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:15.450
<v Speaker 5>it makes,</v>

3229
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:16.283
<v Speaker 5>just want to throw up.</v>

3230
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:17.303
<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

3231
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3232
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 5>so often this is a,</v>

3233
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:23.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3234
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:24.730
<v Speaker 5>my friend Brian Cowen,</v>

3235
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 5>who I love dearly,</v>

3236
01:32:25.751 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 5>but he's fucking ridiculous.</v>

3237
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.920
<v Speaker 5>And he's one of those guys that will get on this tangent and listen to one</v>

3238
01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:37.921
<v Speaker 5>person say something and then spout it out as if it's fucking gospel.</v>

3239
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.540
<v Speaker 5>And he hit me with this Peter off it guy?</v>

3240
01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:42.520
<v Speaker 5>Or is that the guy's name?</v>

3241
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 5>Paul?</v>

3242
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:44.910
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck doctor off it.</v>

3243
01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.090
<v Speaker 5>We've fuck his name is.</v>

3244
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.130
<v Speaker 5>And he listened to this guy and without debunking it online at all,</v>

3245
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.200
<v Speaker 5>and I did it real quick,</v>

3246
01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 5>I did a real quick debunking of it and found a bunch of people called bullshit</v>

3247
01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:58.300
<v Speaker 5>on all of his claims.</v>

3248
01:32:59.020 --> 01:32:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>

3249
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:04.380
<v Speaker 5>these studies were from 1942 and it's just like so much of what this guy had</v>

3250
01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3251
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:07.230
<v Speaker 5>what was horseshit?</v>

3252
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.150
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3253
01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:10.120
<v Speaker 5>one of them off it claim that a study,</v>

3254
01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.290
<v Speaker 5>but this guy was basically saying was that taking vitamins and taking</v>

3255
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:16.960
<v Speaker 5>antioxidants can actually cause cancer.</v>

3256
01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.010
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3257
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.840
<v Speaker 5>calen of course never wants to be wrong.</v>

3258
01:33:19.841 --> 01:33:20.790
<v Speaker 5>So he's telling me no,</v>

3259
01:33:20.791 --> 01:33:20.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3260
01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:20.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3261
01:33:20.991 --> 01:33:21.110
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3262
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 5>the all studies confirm this.</v>

3263
01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:24.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the fuck they do man.</v>

3264
01:33:24.150 --> 01:33:25.620
<v Speaker 5>And so I sent him all this,</v>

3265
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3266
01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:26.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3267
01:33:26.831 --> 01:33:27.030
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3268
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:31.930
<v Speaker 5>I've barraged him with all these debunking sites and he backed off finally,</v>

3269
01:33:32.110 --> 01:33:36.460
<v Speaker 5>but for fucking days his Twitter was all about don't take Antioch's and he's,</v>

3270
01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:36.850
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

3271
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:38.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm really convinced,</v>

3272
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:38.380
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3273

<v Speaker 5>you fucking called me up.</v>

3274
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.701
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

3275
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:39.881
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3276

<v Speaker 5>I'm really worried about you.</v>

3277
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:41.950

01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:43.420
<v Speaker 5>you taking vitamins and where are you going to get cancer?</v>

3279
01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:43.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3280
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.150
<v Speaker 5>the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3281
01:33:45.151 --> 01:33:45.760
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3282
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.300
<v Speaker 5>we need it.</v>

3283
01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.530
<v Speaker 5>We need to dive into this.</v>

3284
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:47.771
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3285
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:50.230
<v Speaker 5>to me it angers me.</v>

3286
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:51.660
<v Speaker 5>What was the name of the book he wrote?</v>

3287
01:33:51.661 --> 01:33:52.870
<v Speaker 5>It's do you believe it's called?</v>

3288
01:33:52.871 --> 01:33:53.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm a con.</v>

3289
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:54.303
<v Speaker 5>That's his book.</v>

3290
01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:56.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm a cunt and I'm trying to make money cause that.</v>

3291
01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what's going on with a lot of these fuckheads,</v>

3292
01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 5>these contrarians with these people that make these articles.</v>

3293
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many of them are just idiots.</v>

3294
01:34:04.361 --> 01:34:07.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many of them were like Brian dunning where they just sort of,</v>

3295
01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:07.421
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3296
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:08.500
<v Speaker 5>they're mentally deficient.</v>

3297
01:34:08.501 --> 01:34:11.620
<v Speaker 5>There's something wrong with the way they're thinking worse and you know,</v>

3298
01:34:11.621 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 5>and I discovered that in communicating with Brian over three hours,</v>

3299
01:34:15.461 --> 01:34:15.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3300
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3301
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:19.390
<v Speaker 5>there's something wrong here and I don't know what it is and I don't want to</v>

3302
01:34:19.391 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 5>know what it is.</v>

3303
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:21.610
<v Speaker 5>But it's obvious you're not normal.</v>

3304
01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 5>You're not healthy.</v>

3305
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:22.941
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

3306
01:34:22.941 --> 01:34:24.640
<v Speaker 5>your correlations are not healthy.</v>

3307
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.760
<v Speaker 5>Like just just discussing buildings.</v>

3308
01:34:27.761 --> 01:34:29.500
<v Speaker 5>Falling is like his,</v>

3309
01:34:29.501 --> 01:34:31.480
<v Speaker 5>his way of looking at things is unhealthy.</v>

3310
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:31.930
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3311
01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:32.763
<v Speaker 5>it's not correct.</v>

3312
01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's what this guy's doing.</v>

3313
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if a lot of Nice people who are doing things,</v>

3314
01:34:37.061 --> 01:34:38.560
<v Speaker 5>I think they're just trying to get attention.</v>

3315
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:39.390
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

3316
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.600
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3317
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.600
<v Speaker 5>Kale is going to kill you.</v>

3318
01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.740
<v Speaker 5>Fucking kill is going to kill me.</v>

3319
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that people are loving Kale these days.</v>

3320
01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.880
<v Speaker 5>People are finding these health benefits skills.</v>

3321
01:34:45.881 --> 01:34:50.881
<v Speaker 5>I tuck talk freely and openly about how I drink Kale Salads or Kale shakes</v>

3322
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 5>rather regular basis and how I feel great when I take him.</v>

3323
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:54.911
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3324
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:55.271
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

3325
01:34:55.271 --> 01:34:55.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3326
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:56.231
<v Speaker 5>people will sell him,</v>

3327
01:34:56.231 --> 01:34:57.130
<v Speaker 5>send me these fucking,</v>

3328
01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:58.600
<v Speaker 5>so I read tweets,</v>

3329
01:34:58.601 --> 01:34:59.360
<v Speaker 5>some of them,</v>

3330
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 5>and then I'll find contradictory articles.</v>

3331
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:02.840
<v Speaker 5>I retweet those.</v>

3332
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:07.280
<v Speaker 5>So there's off it fucking thing just drove me up a wall because I started</v>

3333
01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 5>reading all the people that call bullshit on this guy and all these people that</v>

3334
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 5>say that he's kind of dangerous,</v>

3335
01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 5>that the things he's saying are kind of dangerous because they're easily</v>

3336
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:17.780
<v Speaker 5>refutable but he's trying to sell them.</v>

3337
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 5>You selling them,</v>

3338
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:19.340
<v Speaker 5>selling them as fat.</v>

3339
01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:19.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3340
01:35:19.721 --> 01:35:21.190
<v Speaker 4>So let me,</v>

3341
01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.053
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>

3342
01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:23.890
<v Speaker 4>let's dig in here because I really,</v>

3343
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:24.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3344
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.700
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

3345
01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3346
01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.600
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3347
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:28.690
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't familiar with the guy until you brought them to my attention.</v>

3348
01:35:28.691 --> 01:35:30.870
<v Speaker 4>And actually my p my advisor,</v>

3349
01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:34.460
<v Speaker 4>my postdoctoral advisories and 85 year old like world renowned scientist,</v>

3350
01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.400
<v Speaker 4>he knew who the guy was and he was like,</v>

3351
01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:37.900
<v Speaker 4>you're going to crush him.</v>

3352
01:35:37.901 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

3353
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.090
<v Speaker 4>he really doesn't like this guy.</v>

3354
01:35:40.091 --> 01:35:40.241
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3355
01:35:40.241 --> 01:35:42.400
<v Speaker 4>he's familiar with his whole everything he's doing.</v>

3356
01:35:42.401 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I was so angry at Cowen,</v>

3357
01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:45.340
<v Speaker 4>because if you go online,</v>

3358
01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 4>there's just a fucking slew of reputable paypal,</v>

3359
01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:49.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3360
01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:49.800
<v Speaker 4>I think this guy's,</v>

3361
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.171
<v Speaker 4>and no,</v>

3362
01:35:50.171 --> 01:35:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read his book,</v>

3363
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:55.930
<v Speaker 4>but I listened to the podcast and I took notes on what he said and I'm ready.</v>

3364
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

3365
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:58.990
<v Speaker 4>let's go through some of this because I think it's really important.</v>

3366
01:35:58.991 --> 01:35:59.391
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

3367
01:35:59.391 --> 01:35:59.500
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3368
01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.650
<v Speaker 4>this guy makes huge over generalizations,</v>

3369
01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.180
<v Speaker 4>doesn't understand mechanism.</v>

3370
01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.013
<v Speaker 4>It's clear to me.</v>

3371
01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.093
<v Speaker 4>So the first thing,</v>

3372
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.330
<v Speaker 4>the first thing he says is,</v>

3373
01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:08.283
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

3374
01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3375
01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:09.880
<v Speaker 4>we should have,</v>

3376
01:36:09.881 --> 01:36:11.800
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to look at the effects of supplements,</v>

3377
01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:14.380
<v Speaker 4>we need to do randomized controlled trials.</v>

3378
01:36:14.381 --> 01:36:17.740
<v Speaker 4>We need to hold all drugs to the same standard.</v>

3379
01:36:17.741 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 4>We need to do randomized controlled trials.</v>

3380
01:36:19.131 --> 01:36:20.100
<v Speaker 4>So randomized controls,</v>

3381
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:24.160
<v Speaker 4>controlled trials are like the poster child for pharmacological interventions,</v>

3382
01:36:24.161 --> 01:36:27.390
<v Speaker 4>drug interventions and what they are is you basically you get a population,</v>

3383
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:28.243
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3384
01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.193
<v Speaker 4>you split them into two groups,</v>

3385
01:36:29.230 --> 01:36:31.360
<v Speaker 4>two groups and you're going to have either your,</v>

3386
01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:35.890
<v Speaker 4>your drug blah blah banal or placebo and you're going to give,</v>

3387
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:36.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3388
01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:38.110
<v Speaker 4>whichever group one drug,</v>

3389
01:36:38.111 --> 01:36:38.251
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3390
01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah and all the other groups per se.</v>

3391
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.780
<v Speaker 4>But Oh and you don't know who's getting what.</v>

3392
01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.360
<v Speaker 4>They don't know who's getting what and men are going to look at some clinical</v>

3393
01:36:43.361 --> 01:36:47.950
<v Speaker 4>end point like heart attack or myocardial infarct infarction or something like</v>

3394
01:36:47.951 --> 01:36:48.670
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3395
01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:51.250
<v Speaker 4>And it's really a great design for that,</v>

3396
01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:51.971
<v Speaker 4>that sort of thing.</v>

3397
01:36:51.971 --> 01:36:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

3398
01:36:53.351 --> 01:36:55.060
<v Speaker 4>when you start off at baseline,</v>

3399
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:58.030
<v Speaker 4>everyone in the trial has same levels of drug,</v>

3400
01:36:58.090 --> 01:36:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Blah Blah and all in their blood.</v>

3401
01:36:59.021 --> 01:36:59.441
<v Speaker 4>Guess what,</v>

3402
01:36:59.441 --> 01:37:01.030
<v Speaker 4>zero because we don't make drugs,</v>

3403
01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.170
<v Speaker 4>we don't eat drugs.</v>

3404
01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:02.501
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3405
01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:03.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not something that we're,</v>

3406
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:04.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3407
01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.030
<v Speaker 4>eating on a daily basis.</v>

3408
01:37:06.031 --> 01:37:09.220
<v Speaker 4>This is at pharmacological drug that's been designed with a certain mechanism,</v>

3409
01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.940
<v Speaker 4>mechanism of action to act on a certain thing to do a certain thing,</v>

3410
01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:13.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3411
01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Like you know stands for example.</v>

3412
01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.870
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3413
01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you can do that where you have this randomized controlled trial for a certain x</v>

3414
01:37:21.131 --> 01:37:24.760
<v Speaker 4>amount of time and you look at the effect on heart attacks and you don't have to</v>

3415
01:37:24.761 --> 01:37:25.594
<v Speaker 4>measure anything.</v>

3416
01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:26.913
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3417
01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:32.040
<v Speaker 4>the problem is is that you can't apply that same thinking for nutrition research</v>

3418
01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:37.060
<v Speaker 4>because everyone has different levels of vitamins and minerals in their body.</v>

3419
01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.680
<v Speaker 4>People eat different diets.</v>

3420
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:39.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3421
01:37:39.131 --> 01:37:40.290
<v Speaker 4>you have people that are deaf,</v>

3422
01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:40.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3423
01:37:40.690 --> 01:37:43.090
<v Speaker 4>have inadequate levels of things are deficient in certain things,</v>

3424
01:37:43.091 --> 01:37:45.550
<v Speaker 4>have optimal levels of certain things.</v>

3425
01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.860
<v Speaker 4>And so if you just take this random group of people,</v>

3426
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:51.760
<v Speaker 4>put them into two groups and then give them a vitamin supplement and then try to</v>

3427
01:37:51.761 --> 01:37:53.890
<v Speaker 4>look at some clinical end point like heart attack.</v>

3428
01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>

3429
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have people that have were severely deficient and whatever you</v>

3430
01:37:59.251 --> 01:37:59.731
<v Speaker 4>gave them,</v>

3431
01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 4>they're still severely deficient.</v>

3432
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Or you're going to have people that are top total adequate levels.</v>

3433
01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:05.040
<v Speaker 4>And you're getting,</v>

3434
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 4>giving them a vitamin.</v>

3435
01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 4>They already have adequate levels up and you're trying to look at some clinical</v>

3436
01:38:08.851 --> 01:38:09.540
<v Speaker 4>end point.</v>

3437
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.540
<v Speaker 4>You can't do nutrition research with the same mind frame where whereas we're</v>

3438
01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:18.090
<v Speaker 4>looking at we're going to do the same type of trial that we do for drugs.</v>

3439
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:18.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3440
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:18.991
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>

3441
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:20.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

3442
01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:21.151
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

3443
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 4>You have to think about the way you control and design a clinical trial.</v>

3444
01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 4>And when you're doing nutrition research,</v>

3445
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:26.730
<v Speaker 4>where you're,</v>

3446
01:38:26.730 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 4>where you're looking at the effects of vitamins and minerals,</v>

3447
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:29.424
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

3448
01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.360
<v Speaker 4>that there's two very different things going on when you have a pharmacological</v>

3449
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:34.194
<v Speaker 4>drug,</v>

3450
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 4>your giving it to someone because they're already falling apart.</v>

3451
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:37.891
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3452
01:38:37.891 --> 01:38:41.190
<v Speaker 4>They're already falling apart and you're trying to help them not fall apart as</v>

3453
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 4>fast by giving them something you know,</v>

3454
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:47.180
<v Speaker 4>that blocks x or y or z or like cholesterol synthesis for one Stanton's,</v>

3455
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3456
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.470
<v Speaker 4>with vitamins and minerals.</v>

3457
01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 4>These are things that are important for,</v>

3458
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:52.180
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

3459
01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 4>for preventing you from falling apart.</v>

3460
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.120
<v Speaker 4>These are things that we require these enzymes we need,</v>

3461
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:57.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3462
01:38:57.481 --> 01:39:01.680
<v Speaker 4>cofactors for enzymes that we need to do like hundreds of different</v>

3463
01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:02.880
<v Speaker 4>physiological functions,</v>

3464
01:39:02.881 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 4>thousands of different physiological functions.</v>

3465
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3466
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:08.880
<v Speaker 4>so we're talking about a different start point,</v>

3467
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3468
01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:10.081
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3469
01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:12.780
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you give people vitamins when they're falling apart.</v>

3470
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3471
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 4>they know they need to be getting their vitamins to make sure they don't fall</v>

3472
01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>

3473
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3474
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.130
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole randomized controlled trial using that,</v>

3475
01:39:20.131 --> 01:39:20.460
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3476
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:20.640
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3477
01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.120
<v Speaker 4>so he kept saying this like we need to hold vitamins to the same standard as</v>

3478
01:39:24.121 --> 01:39:24.481
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

3479
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:26.160
<v Speaker 4>We need to have randomized controlled trials.</v>

3480
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:29.800
<v Speaker 4>And that's how we determine whether or not they're effective or their,</v>

3481
01:39:29.801 --> 01:39:29.930
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

3482
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 4>their efficacy rate basically.</v>

3483
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:32.341
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>

3484
01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:33.091
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>

3485
01:39:33.091 --> 01:39:35.340
<v Speaker 4>You have to measure people's vitamin and mineral levels.</v>

3486
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Let's like,</v>

3487
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 4>let's say you're looking at vitamin D at baseline to see how efficient they are.</v>

3488
01:39:39.961 --> 01:39:40.351
<v Speaker 4>For one,</v>

3489
01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 4>this is going to determine the dose that you give them.</v>

3490
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:42.991
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3491
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 4>if someone's like 12 nanograms per milliliter and you give them 400 Ius a day,</v>

3492
01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.930
<v Speaker 4>they've even shown in that annals of internal medicine paper that doesn't work.</v>

3493
01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:54.000
<v Speaker 4>They're still going to be deficient at the end of the trial.</v>

3494
01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:55.080
<v Speaker 4>You can because you know,</v>

3495
01:39:55.081 --> 01:39:58.620
<v Speaker 4>400 Ius a day raises your blood levels by like five nanograms per milliliter.</v>

3496
01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:01.620
<v Speaker 4>So you can't just not the way to do</v>

3497
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:02.420
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>

3498
01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.840
<v Speaker 5>the difference being that given someone something that's completely alien to the</v>

3499
01:40:05.841 --> 01:40:10.550
<v Speaker 5>body but could be beneficial like a drug or giving them something that is</v>

3500
01:40:10.551 --> 01:40:14.390
<v Speaker 5>absolutely essential to the body that is necessary and is a part of normal</v>

3501
01:40:14.391 --> 01:40:18.890
<v Speaker 5>everyday diet that you can't look at the two of them the same way that the drug</v>

3502
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:20.570
<v Speaker 5>may help people,</v>

3503
01:40:20.630 --> 01:40:25.520
<v Speaker 5>but the reality is you're introducing something that's completely alien to the</v>

3504
01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:27.650
<v Speaker 5>person's system in order to benefit them.</v>

3505
01:40:27.651 --> 01:40:32.651
<v Speaker 5>Whereas with vitamins you are just regulating or measuring what is essential to</v>

3506
01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:34.610
<v Speaker 5>the human body and and,</v>

3507
01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:34.851
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3508
01:40:34.851 --> 01:40:37.700
<v Speaker 5>and pretty much has been established that vitamin B,</v>

3509
01:40:37.701 --> 01:40:38.451
<v Speaker 5>Vitamin D,</v>

3510
01:40:38.451 --> 01:40:39.201
<v Speaker 5>vitamin C,</v>

3511
01:40:39.201 --> 01:40:43.280
<v Speaker 5>all of these different things is that various aspects of nutrition are essential</v>

3512
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.570
<v Speaker 5>to human health.</v>

3513
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:45.140
<v Speaker 5>That's one,</v>

3514
01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.370
<v Speaker 5>that's one aspect of it.</v>

3515
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:48.650
<v Speaker 5>You can't look at a drug the same way you look at vital.</v>

3516
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:49.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3517
01:40:49.201 --> 01:40:49.771
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

3518
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:50.311
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

3519
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:53.650
<v Speaker 4>people already start off with varying levels of these vitamins.</v>

3520
01:40:53.651 --> 01:40:56.080
<v Speaker 4>So when you're randomizing them into two different populations,</v>

3521
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.920
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

3522
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Some of these people get up could be very deficient.</v>

3523
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Some have plenty of vitaminK or whatever you're looking at.</v>

3524
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:05.050
<v Speaker 4>So you need to measure them at baseline.</v>

3525
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:07.090
<v Speaker 4>So you'd get a deficient population.</v>

3526
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:11.440
<v Speaker 4>You need to get a population that's low because the whole point of,</v>

3527
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3528
01:41:11.711 --> 01:41:15.010
<v Speaker 4>giving someone a vitamin supplement is to bring them up to an adequate level.</v>

3529
01:41:15.011 --> 01:41:17.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not to like have some effect on top.</v>

3530
01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a drug where you're,</v>

3531
01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3532
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:21.490
<v Speaker 4>blocking some receptor and having some response.</v>

3533
01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:22.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3534
01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:25.000
<v Speaker 4>you're taking vitamins and mineral supplements because you're not getting</v>

3535
01:41:25.001 --> 01:41:27.700
<v Speaker 4>everything you need from your food and you want to get yourself up to an</v>

3536
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:28.534
<v Speaker 4>adequate level.</v>

3537
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:30.560
<v Speaker 4>And so what you need to do is start off,</v>

3538
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.890
<v Speaker 4>you need to measure people's levels at baseline.</v>

3539
01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Start off with a population that's inadequate,</v>

3540
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.950
<v Speaker 4>give them a vitamin and mineral supplement to get them to an adequate level.</v>

3541
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.390
<v Speaker 4>And then you can measure something.</v>

3542
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.770
<v Speaker 4>So it's really important,</v>

3543
01:41:41.771 --> 01:41:43.150
<v Speaker 4>and I think they even talked about this last time,</v>

3544
01:41:43.151 --> 01:41:44.200
<v Speaker 4>is quantifying these levels.</v>

3545
01:41:44.201 --> 01:41:44.321
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3546
01:41:44.321 --> 01:41:46.210
<v Speaker 4>this is the reason why you can't,</v>

3547
01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:46.410
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3548
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:46.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3549
01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:51.040
<v Speaker 4>starting off with a population of people that has enough vitamin D and You're</v>

3550
01:41:51.041 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 4>trying to look at the effects of vitamin D on cancer incidents.</v>

3551
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Well guess what?</v>

3552
01:41:55.661 --> 01:41:55.901
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3553
01:41:55.901 --> 01:41:58.810
<v Speaker 4>they already have enough vitamin D they're already in is adequate range.</v>

3554
01:41:59.020 --> 01:41:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Or conversely,</v>

3555
01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.791
<v Speaker 4>if they're really,</v>

3556
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:01.151
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

3557
01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 4>really deficient and you're looking at the effects of vitamin D and cancer</v>

3558
01:42:04.211 --> 01:42:05.020
<v Speaker 4>incidents,</v>

3559
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 4>and you give them a dose that still makes them,</v>

3560
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.740
<v Speaker 4>they're still deficient.</v>

3561
01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:09.161
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3562
01:42:09.161 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

3563
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.623
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what,</v>

3564
01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:12.160
<v Speaker 4>how vitamin D is affecting cancer.</v>

3565
01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:13.330
<v Speaker 4>And since from that one study,</v>

3566
01:42:13.331 --> 01:42:15.370
<v Speaker 4>because they're still deficient at the end of the trial,</v>

3567
01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:16.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3568
01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 4>so the conclusion is,</v>

3569
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:17.381
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3570
01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:18.520
<v Speaker 4>my dose was inefficient,</v>

3571
01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:22.360
<v Speaker 4>was inadequate to bring them to an adequate level of vitamin D.</v>

3572
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:22.781
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3573
01:42:22.781 --> 01:42:23.770
<v Speaker 4>that should be the conclusion,</v>

3574
01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:24.010
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3575
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:24.131
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3576
01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:25.530
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D doesn't affect cancer incidents.</v>

3577
01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:25.800
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3578
01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:25.990
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3579
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Which is what people tend to do,</v>

3580
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

3581
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:29.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3582
01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:31.870
<v Speaker 4>you have to sell your story to get it published.</v>

3583
01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:32.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3584
01:42:32.321 --> 01:42:32.861
<v Speaker 4>you do all,</v>

3585
01:42:32.861 --> 01:42:35.350
<v Speaker 4>you need years and years work of research and,</v>

3586
01:42:35.351 --> 01:42:35.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3587
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.050
<v Speaker 4>you find this negative data and it's like,</v>

3588
01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:38.141
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3589
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:40.750
<v Speaker 4>you gotta sell it somehow so you're not going to sell it by saying,</v>

3590
01:42:40.751 --> 01:42:40.931
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3591
01:42:40.931 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 4>well it didn't give them an adequate dose and they're still not,</v>

3592
01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:44.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3593
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:44.980
<v Speaker 4>up to adequate levels.</v>

3594
01:42:44.981 --> 01:42:45.814
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

3595
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:46.811
<v Speaker 4>that's really,</v>

3596
01:42:46.811 --> 01:42:46.940
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3597
01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:50.830
<v Speaker 4>the one first thing about off it and so many others,</v>

3598
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.520
<v Speaker 4>including the people that wrote that this whole and offers enough editorial.</v>

3599
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3600
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.361
<v Speaker 4>there are the same,</v>

3601
01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:57.280
<v Speaker 4>they were looking at randomized control trials.</v>

3602
01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time they started off with people didn't measure anything at all at</v>

3603
01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 4>start or throughout,</v>

3604
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:03.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3605
01:43:03.101 --> 01:43:03.391
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3606
01:43:03.391 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 4>the followups and you know,</v>

3607
01:43:05.171 --> 01:43:05.471
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

3608
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:05.880
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3609
01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.850
<v Speaker 5>well the enough is enough was even worse because enough is enough.</v>

3610
01:43:08.851 --> 01:43:09.690
<v Speaker 5>Where they were studying.</v>

3611
01:43:09.691 --> 01:43:10.950
<v Speaker 5>Two of the things that we're studying,</v>

3612
01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:15.951
<v Speaker 5>we're heart attacks and people over 65 and dementia did delaying the onset of</v>

3613
01:43:17.251 --> 01:43:21.420
<v Speaker 5>dementia in people who are over 65 like Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

3614
01:43:21.421 --> 01:43:22.860
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about people who are dying,</v>

3615
01:43:22.861 --> 01:43:23.280
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3616
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.900
<v Speaker 5>And you're giving them vitamins and saying,</v>

3617
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:26.610
<v Speaker 5>doc didn't stop them from dying.</v>

3618
01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.060
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3619
01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.680
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with compete completely broken human beings that are like on</v>

3620
01:43:31.681 --> 01:43:32.940
<v Speaker 5>death's door.</v>

3621
01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.010
<v Speaker 5>There's the forgetting shit.</v>

3622
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.590
<v Speaker 5>They don't know where they are and their heart's failing.</v>

3623
01:43:37.710 --> 01:43:38.000
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

3624
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:38.250
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3625
01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:39.150
<v Speaker 5>vitamins don't work.</v>

3626
01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:39.871
<v Speaker 5>So to say,</v>

3627
01:43:39.871 --> 01:43:43.230
<v Speaker 5>vitamins don't work in those two circumstances is ridiculous.</v>

3628
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:47.640
<v Speaker 5>And there are other circumstance showed a slight improvement with vitamins,</v>

3629
01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.170
<v Speaker 5>and yet they still came to conclusion.</v>

3630
01:43:49.171 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 5>The vitamins don't work because that's the most title,</v>

3631
01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:52.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3632
01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:53.593
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3633
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:57.560
<v Speaker 4>vitamins and minerals are important to prevent disease.</v>

3634
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:59.720
<v Speaker 4>They are important to prevent disease.</v>

3635
01:43:59.721 --> 01:43:59.991
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3636
01:43:59.991 --> 01:44:00.441
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

3637
01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 4>it's not like if you're already falling apart and you've already been deficient</v>

3638
01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 4>for years and years and years and years and years,</v>

3639
01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:06.321
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

3640
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 4>It's much harder to patch things up much more difficult.</v>

3641
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:10.850
<v Speaker 4>You've already acquired so much damage.</v>

3642
01:44:10.851 --> 01:44:14.180
<v Speaker 4>You've acquired so many different things that are going wrong that trying to</v>

3643
01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:16.430
<v Speaker 4>patch it up later is really difficult.</v>

3644
01:44:16.670 --> 01:44:18.310
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>

3645
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.810
<v Speaker 4>in those studies also they did things where they were giving it to cancer</v>

3646
01:44:20.811 --> 01:44:21.590
<v Speaker 4>patients.</v>

3647
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:22.340
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>

3648
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.330
<v Speaker 4>or if smokers,</v>

3649
01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:28.010
<v Speaker 4>they were looking at the effects of Beta carotene or vitamin A in smokers.</v>

3650
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:33.220
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is is that smokers are a different breed because,</v>

3651
01:44:33.981 --> 01:44:36.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're taking in poison every day.</v>

3652
01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:38.540
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is their lungs,</v>

3653
01:44:38.541 --> 01:44:40.430
<v Speaker 4>they have a very oxidative environment.</v>

3654
01:44:40.730 --> 01:44:43.190
<v Speaker 4>So when they take vitamin Beta carotene,</v>

3655
01:44:43.191 --> 01:44:44.750
<v Speaker 4>which is part of the vitamin a family,</v>

3656
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 4>this Beta carotene gets cleaved because they have oxidative stress and stuff</v>

3657
01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:49.491
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

3658
01:44:49.491 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 4>It gets cleaved into some of these cleavage products which actually damaged DNA</v>

3659
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 4>more and Co and can accelerate cancer.</v>

3660
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3661
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:58.670
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is is that that's specific to smokers.</v>

3662
01:44:58.671 --> 01:45:01.400
<v Speaker 4>If you give the same dose of Beta carotene to a nonsmoker,</v>

3663
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:02.151
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

3664
01:45:02.151 --> 01:45:02.984
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't happen.</v>

3665
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:06.440
<v Speaker 4>They don't get those cleavage products and it doesn't start damaged their DNA</v>

3666
01:45:06.441 --> 01:45:07.910
<v Speaker 4>more and it doesn't accelerate cancer.</v>

3667
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:08.751
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3668
01:45:08.751 --> 01:45:09.531
<v Speaker 4>you have to really,</v>

3669
01:45:09.531 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 4>the context is so important.</v>

3670
01:45:11.541 --> 01:45:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3671
01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3672
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:12.980
<v Speaker 4>you can't just say,</v>

3673
01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:13.250
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3674
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:14.660
<v Speaker 4>vitamin A's bad for you.</v>

3675
01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3676
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3677
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.970
<v Speaker 4>if you're a smoker,</v>

3678
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3679
01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:17.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3680
01:45:17.781 --> 01:45:19.370
<v Speaker 4>this is a certain context where,</v>

3681
01:45:19.371 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3682
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:23.750
<v Speaker 4>there can be problems with taking high doses of Beta carotene for that reason</v>

3683
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:24.351
<v Speaker 4>where you're,</v>

3684
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:24.651
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3685
01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:28.460
<v Speaker 4>you've got all these oxidative stress things going on.</v>

3686
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:31.760
<v Speaker 4>And so they cleave the Beta Beta carotene into the certain cleavage products</v>

3687
01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 4>that normal people don't get.</v>

3688
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:33.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3689
01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:38.720
<v Speaker 4>so context is very important and this is something that so many people so often</v>

3690
01:45:38.721 --> 01:45:39.201
<v Speaker 4>ignore,</v>

3691
01:45:39.201 --> 01:45:40.130
<v Speaker 4>including off it.</v>

3692
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3693
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3694
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

3695
01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:42.201
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3696
01:45:42.201 --> 01:45:43.850
<v Speaker 4>he's basically states that,</v>

3697
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.500
<v Speaker 4>and he says clear.</v>

3698
01:45:45.501 --> 01:45:49.680
<v Speaker 4>It's clear and consistent that antioxidant antioxidants,</v>

3699
01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:53.030
<v Speaker 4>supplements are bad for you and can give you cancer.</v>

3700
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 4>And he gives two examples.</v>

3701
01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.340
<v Speaker 4>The one example he says is the prostate cancer study.</v>

3702
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.760
<v Speaker 4>And the second example he says is because you need oxidants around in your body</v>

3703
01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 4>to prevent cancer cells,</v>

3704
01:46:06.351 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 4>it kills cancer cells.</v>

3705
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3706
01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.121
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3707
01:46:08.121 --> 01:46:09.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of like,</v>

3708
01:46:09.621 --> 01:46:14.390
<v Speaker 4>well it's kind of a big overgeneralization and it really shows me his lack of</v>

3709
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:15.111
<v Speaker 4>understanding,</v>

3710
01:46:15.111 --> 01:46:19.490
<v Speaker 4>his lack of understanding of mechanism either because it's too much work to look</v>

3711
01:46:19.491 --> 01:46:22.010
<v Speaker 4>into it because it's a lot of work or you know,</v>

3712
01:46:22.011 --> 01:46:23.780
<v Speaker 4>just because he doesn't care,</v>

3713
01:46:24.090 --> 01:46:24.440
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3714
01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.160
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

3715
01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:25.461
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3716
01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:27.800
<v Speaker 4>so let's start off with the first part.</v>

3717
01:46:27.801 --> 01:46:28.101
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

3718
01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:28.934
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3719
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 4>vitamin E can cause prostate cancer.</v>

3720
01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3721
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.351
<v Speaker 4>this is huge.</v>

3722
01:46:33.351 --> 01:46:33.801
<v Speaker 4>This is actually,</v>

3723
01:46:33.801 --> 01:46:34.581
<v Speaker 4>there was a huge,</v>

3724
01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 4>huge study called the uh,</v>

3725
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.970
<v Speaker 4>select trial where they took the,</v>

3726
01:46:38.971 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 4>the selenium and vitamin E cancer prevention trial.</v>

3727
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.820
<v Speaker 4>Selenium is also important.</v>

3728
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a cofactor for about 25 or so different proteins that are one of them being</v>

3729
01:46:48.501 --> 01:46:52.920
<v Speaker 4>glued Oth I peroxidase and synthase and all these different antioxidant genes.</v>

3730
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:57.750
<v Speaker 4>And it's been shown to selenium highest Linnaean was correlated with low cancer</v>

3731
01:46:57.751 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 4>incidents,</v>

3732
01:46:58.410 --> 01:47:00.990
<v Speaker 4>so they thought that would play a role in prostate cancer.</v>

3733
01:47:00.991 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 4>So they did this big trial where they got like someone like 30,000 men is pretty</v>

3734
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:10.551
<v Speaker 4>big and they gave him supplements that gave them either vitamin e.</v>

3735
01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 4>So vitamin E is actually,</v>

3736
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole family of vitamin E's.</v>

3737
01:47:14.491 --> 01:47:15.990
<v Speaker 4>It's not just one vitamin,</v>

3738
01:47:16.290 --> 01:47:17.880
<v Speaker 4>there's actually eight different forms of it.</v>

3739
01:47:18.570 --> 01:47:19.403
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3740
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:20.401
<v Speaker 4>Alpha Beta,</v>

3741
01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:21.234
<v Speaker 4>Gamma Delta,</v>

3742
01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:26.150
<v Speaker 4>and there's the present is either tocopherols or took her adrenals tribunals,</v>

3743
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.580
<v Speaker 4>and the major forms are Alpha and gamma tocopherol.</v>

3744
01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.480
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3745
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.380
<v Speaker 4>And these two different forms of vitamin E,</v>

3746
01:47:32.381 --> 01:47:35.260
<v Speaker 4>the Alpha and gamma tocopherol there,</v>

3747
01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.420
<v Speaker 4>they're antioxidants,</v>

3748
01:47:36.421 --> 01:47:38.280
<v Speaker 4>but they actually have separate functions.</v>

3749
01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.720
<v Speaker 4>So the Alpha Tocopherol is a very potent antioxidant,</v>

3750
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 4>so it's very good at,</v>

3751
01:47:44.710 --> 01:47:45.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3752
01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.470
<v Speaker 4>getting oxygen,</v>

3753
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 4>reactive oxygen radicals that's generated by like normal metabolism.</v>

3754
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:51.690
<v Speaker 4>These things damage your DNA,</v>

3755
01:47:51.691 --> 01:47:53.190
<v Speaker 4>but they also damage your lipid,</v>

3756
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.200
<v Speaker 4>like Byler of your membranes,</v>

3757
01:47:55.201 --> 01:47:55.711
<v Speaker 4>cell membranes.</v>

3758
01:47:55.711 --> 01:47:58.290
<v Speaker 4>What happens is vitamin D is fat soluble,</v>

3759
01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:01.430
<v Speaker 4>so it gets him those lipid by layers and it prevents the,</v>

3760
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 4>that oxygen radical from damaging it.</v>

3761
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:05.730
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is if you don't have that happening,</v>

3762
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:08.400
<v Speaker 4>your lip and membranes get stiffer and stiffer over time.</v>

3763
01:48:08.401 --> 01:48:10.020
<v Speaker 4>And this is part of aging where you're,</v>

3764
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.501
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3765
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 4>they become rigid and it's hard to transport metabolites into your cells.</v>

3766
01:48:13.710 --> 01:48:15.300
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to transport proteins in and out.</v>

3767
01:48:15.301 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3768
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.770
<v Speaker 4>it screws up stuff.</v>

3769
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:18.300
<v Speaker 4>So it's important to have,</v>

3770
01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:18.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3771
01:48:18.811 --> 01:48:21.900
<v Speaker 4>something like five Alpha Tocopherol preventing that from happening.</v>

3772
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.200
<v Speaker 4>It also prevents your proteins from being oxidized,</v>

3773
01:48:25.201 --> 01:48:25.951
<v Speaker 4>which causes problems.</v>

3774
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 4>So that's really important to have.</v>

3775
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:28.771
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3776
01:48:28.771 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 4>and you actually need to get it from your diet.</v>

3777
01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:32.610
<v Speaker 4>The vitamin E's you have to get from your diet,</v>

3778
01:48:32.611 --> 01:48:33.151
<v Speaker 4>from plants.</v>

3779
01:48:33.151 --> 01:48:34.230
<v Speaker 4>We don't make it ourselves.</v>

3780
01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:38.100
<v Speaker 4>The gamma form actually is also an antioxidant,</v>

3781
01:48:38.101 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's an anti nitration one.</v>

3782
01:48:40.471 --> 01:48:43.350
<v Speaker 4>So nitration is formed from your immune system.</v>

3783
01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Just normal immune function,</v>

3784
01:48:45.211 --> 01:48:45.740
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3785
01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3786
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:49.710
<v Speaker 4>fighting off things creates reactive nitrogen species.</v>

3787
01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 4>So these nitrogen species also do the same thing as oxygen species.</v>

3788
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:54.660
<v Speaker 4>They damage your DNA,</v>

3789
01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:55.141
<v Speaker 4>the damage,</v>

3790
01:48:55.141 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 4>your lipid membranes,</v>

3791
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 4>the damaged proteins in your body.</v>

3792
01:48:58.110 --> 01:49:01.750
<v Speaker 4>So having both Alpha Tocopherol and the Gamma Tocopherol,</v>

3793
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:05.880
<v Speaker 4>they're doing two independent functions is important because they're making sure</v>

3794
01:49:05.881 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting those oxygen or nitrogen reactive species damaging crap in</v>

3795
01:49:09.991 --> 01:49:10.890
<v Speaker 4>your body basically.</v>

3796
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:11.850
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3797
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:14.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's important to prevent cancer,</v>

3798
01:49:14.191 --> 01:49:15.024
<v Speaker 4>to prevent,</v>

3799
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:15.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3800
01:49:15.421 --> 01:49:17.640
<v Speaker 4>a lot of diseases of aging.</v>

3801
01:49:17.641 --> 01:49:18.910
<v Speaker 4>So protein said begin,</v>

3802
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:22.550
<v Speaker 4>come or get nitrated aggregate and they can form you know,</v>

3803
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 4>things and plaques in your brain.</v>

3804
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:25.440
<v Speaker 4>They can cause neurodegenerative diseases.</v>

3805
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.201
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

3806
01:49:26.201 --> 01:49:27.510
<v Speaker 4>it's important to have,</v>

3807
01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:28.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3808
01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:31.800
<v Speaker 4>these antioxidant mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening as we age.</v>

3809
01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:32.693
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3810
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:34.650
<v Speaker 4>So with that said,</v>

3811
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 4>the Alpha Tocopherol and you can see how complex this is.</v>

3812
01:49:37.471 --> 01:49:37.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3813
01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 4>the Alpha Tocopherol is the major form in your tissues and in your bloodstream.</v>

3814
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:46.020
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is is that when you take really high levels of it,</v>

3815
01:49:46.021 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 4>so the Rda is like 22.4 I use,</v>

3816
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.030
<v Speaker 4>when you take really high like 10 times at like 400 I use,</v>

3817
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 4>what happens is it depletes your gamma levels.</v>

3818
01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3819
01:49:57.370 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 4>And this has been well known for like over a decade.</v>

3820
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Multiple labs have shown this,</v>

3821
01:50:01.781 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 4>including the lab I work in and they showed it in many years ago before I even</v>

3822
01:50:04.511 --> 01:50:05.890
<v Speaker 4>joined their lab.</v>

3823
01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3824
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:07.991
<v Speaker 4>taking high,</v>

3825
01:50:07.991 --> 01:50:12.130
<v Speaker 4>high levels of Alpha can be bad because it depletes the gamma and the gamma has</v>

3826
01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 4>a separate function from the alpha.</v>

3827
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.070
<v Speaker 4>It prevents that nitration.</v>

3828
01:50:15.071 --> 01:50:16.880
<v Speaker 4>It also is an antiinflammatory,</v>

3829
01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:18.910
<v Speaker 4>inhibits Cox enzymes,</v>

3830
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:21.430
<v Speaker 4>which are involved in generating prostoglandins.</v>

3831
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:26.730
<v Speaker 4>So what they did was they gave men either Alpha to cough or all 400 I'd use.</v>

3832
01:50:27.381 --> 01:50:28.750
<v Speaker 4>So 10 times the Rda,</v>

3833
01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:30.130
<v Speaker 4>maybe even one in 10 times.</v>

3834
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:32.230
<v Speaker 4>And salinium.</v>

3835
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:33.131
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3836
01:50:33.131 --> 01:50:37.750
<v Speaker 4>So they give them either outfit to cough or all salinium only or both Alpha</v>

3837
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:38.221
<v Speaker 4>Tocopherol insulin,</v>

3838
01:50:38.221 --> 01:50:39.250
<v Speaker 4>IOM or the placebo.</v>

3839
01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:40.750
<v Speaker 4>And then they looked,</v>

3840
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:41.643
<v Speaker 4>they followed up,</v>

3841
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:45.430
<v Speaker 4>they did a couple of followups to look at prostate cancer incidents.</v>

3842
01:50:45.490 --> 01:50:46.323
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3843
01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 4>So the first study was about five and a half year follow up.</v>

3844
01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.720
<v Speaker 4>And this was published in like 2009 and what it found was there's no effect</v>

3845
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.690
<v Speaker 4>taking vitamin E had no effect on cancer incidents.</v>

3846
01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 4>Taking selenium had no effect.</v>

3847
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:58.150
<v Speaker 4>But what they,</v>

3848
01:50:58.150 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 4>what you can see if you look at the data is they measured their alpha and gamma</v>

3849
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 4>levels at baseline.</v>

3850
01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.290
<v Speaker 4>And then at five and a half years,</v>

3851
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:10.291
<v Speaker 4>what happened was those men taking 400 I use depleted their gamma tocopherol by</v>

3852
01:51:10.511 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 4>like 45% at the end of the followup,</v>

3853
01:51:13.090 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 4>which is like crazy.</v>

3854
01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.213
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

3855
01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3856
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 4>and then the second followup,</v>

3857
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:20.200
<v Speaker 4>what it found is it's seven and a half years later they found that,</v>

3858
01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:20.951
<v Speaker 4>oh my goodness,</v>

3859
01:51:20.951 --> 01:51:21.880
<v Speaker 4>the men taking,</v>

3860
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:22.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3861
01:51:22.721 --> 01:51:27.721
<v Speaker 4>400 I use of Alpha Alpha tocopherol had a 17% increase risk of prostate cancer.</v>

3862
01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:30.310
<v Speaker 4>And then they went on to say,</v>

3863
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 4>oh my goodness,</v>

3864
01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3865
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:34.240
<v Speaker 4>400 I use a vitamin e a day can cause prostate cancer.</v>

3866
01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

3867
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the men taking the selenium with the vitamin,</v>

3868
01:51:38.051 --> 01:51:38.711
<v Speaker 4>he didn't get it.</v>

3869
01:51:38.711 --> 01:51:41.260
<v Speaker 4>So the men taking that outfit to cough for all by itself,</v>

3870
01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:44.860
<v Speaker 4>but took once it took with the selenium with it didn't get it.</v>

3871
01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:47.290
<v Speaker 4>So that salinium protected and they didn't know why.</v>

3872
01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.330
<v Speaker 4>So another study then recently came out from the sand.</v>

3873
01:51:50.331 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 4>This is all the same big cohort of people found that only the men that were</v>

3874
01:51:54.821 --> 01:51:59.800
<v Speaker 4>severely deficient in selenium to start the trial that took the Alpha Tocopherol</v>

3875
01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:01.990
<v Speaker 4>or the ones that had the increased cancer incidents.</v>

3876
01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 4>So I started thinking about this,</v>

3877
01:52:03.671 --> 01:52:03.791
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3878
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 4>why is that selenium also is important is uh,</v>

3879
01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:08.441
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

3880
01:52:08.441 --> 01:52:10.600
<v Speaker 4>it's important for pro like 25 or so proteins.</v>

3881
01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:15.700
<v Speaker 4>One of them is important for preventing nitration reactive nitration products.</v>

3882
01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:16.811
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

3883
01:52:16.811 --> 01:52:17.171
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3884
01:52:17.171 --> 01:52:17.981
<v Speaker 4>well this makes sense.</v>

3885
01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 4>You're taking high levels of outfits,</v>

3886
01:52:19.391 --> 01:52:19.790
<v Speaker 4>coffer,</v>

3887
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:21.580
<v Speaker 4>all depleting your gamma levels,</v>

3888
01:52:21.581 --> 01:52:24.250
<v Speaker 4>which is important to get rid of nitration damage,</v>

3889
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:24.701
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3890
01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Which damages DNA,</v>

3891
01:52:25.901 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 4>causes cancer,</v>

3892
01:52:27.010 --> 01:52:27.843
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

3893
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:31.390
<v Speaker 4>And yet you can give someone this salinium Irmaa if they're,</v>

3894
01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.860
<v Speaker 4>if they're not deficient in selenium,</v>

3895
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.060
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't happen.</v>

3896
01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:36.580
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the selenium proteins also does that.</v>

3897
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.230
<v Speaker 4>So the bottom line is,</v>

3898
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:39.791
<v Speaker 4>does taking,</v>

3899
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:40.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3900
01:52:40.450 --> 01:52:44.230
<v Speaker 4>normal levels of Alpha Tocopherol like 22 or 30,</v>

3901
01:52:44.231 --> 01:52:45.064
<v Speaker 4>I use a day,</v>

3902
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:46.460
<v Speaker 4>deplete your gamma levels?</v>

3903
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3904
01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

3905
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:49.070
<v Speaker 4>is it good for you?</v>

3906
01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:49.341
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3907
01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:50.920
<v Speaker 4>is it going to prevent your op,</v>

3908
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3909
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.920
<v Speaker 4>lipid membranes from oxidizing and your DNA from getting oxidized yest uh,</v>

3910
01:52:54.921 --> 01:52:55.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3911
01:52:55.341 --> 01:52:56.450
<v Speaker 4>is it going to give you cancer?</v>

3912
01:52:56.451 --> 01:52:57.284
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3913
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:58.850
<v Speaker 4>it's actually the opposite.</v>

3914
01:52:58.851 --> 01:53:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Prevents cancer is taking high,</v>

3915
01:53:00.651 --> 01:53:03.410
<v Speaker 4>high levels of of Alpha Tocopherol dangerous?</v>

3916
01:53:03.411 --> 01:53:04.041
<v Speaker 4>Well it can be,</v>

3917
01:53:04.041 --> 01:53:04.401
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3918
01:53:04.401 --> 01:53:05.660
<v Speaker 4>because it depletes your gamma.</v>

3919
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.771
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3920
01:53:06.771 --> 01:53:08.930
<v Speaker 4>taking high levels of Alpha to call for all is not a,</v>

3921
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:11.180
<v Speaker 4>is not a good thing because it can deplete your gamma,</v>

3922
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:13.550
<v Speaker 4>but that's only if you're also selenium deficient.</v>

3923
01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:14.421
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

3924
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:15.650
<v Speaker 4>very complicated.</v>

3925
01:53:15.651 --> 01:53:19.820
<v Speaker 4>It is not simple and it's not as simple as taking vitamin E is going to give you</v>

3926
01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:20.540
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>

3927
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:20.991
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3928
01:53:20.991 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole host of complex mechanisms that are at play here.</v>

3929
01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:25.100
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3930
01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 4>and the reality is,</v>

3931
01:53:26.061 --> 01:53:26.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3932
01:53:26.241 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 4>if you want to,</v>

3933
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 4>60% of the population doesn't have enough Alpha Tocopherol.</v>

3934
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:30.591
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3935
01:53:30.591 --> 01:53:31.424
<v Speaker 4>60%.</v>

3936
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:32.391
<v Speaker 4>So if you,</v>

3937
01:53:32.391 --> 01:53:34.490
<v Speaker 4>if you want to supplement with it,</v>

3938
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.570
<v Speaker 4>just don't be dumb.</v>

3939
01:53:35.571 --> 01:53:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Take a take a lower level of and supplement with the mix.</v>

3940
01:53:38.241 --> 01:53:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You can buy a mixed tocopherols together.</v>

3941
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.700
<v Speaker 4>So they get the Alpha,</v>

3942
01:53:41.701 --> 01:53:42.021
<v Speaker 4>the GAM,</v>

3943
01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:42.540
<v Speaker 4>and the Beta.</v>

3944
01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.180
<v Speaker 4>What does a good source of that?</v>

3945
01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3946
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:46.450
<v Speaker 4>so ABA,</v>

3947
01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.151
<v Speaker 4>Cahtos,</v>

3948
01:53:47.151 --> 01:53:47.811
<v Speaker 4>Pecans,</v>

3949
01:53:47.811 --> 01:53:48.261
<v Speaker 4>walnuts,</v>

3950
01:53:48.261 --> 01:53:49.340
<v Speaker 4>plant plant sources.</v>

3951
01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.520
<v Speaker 4>I like to get my,</v>

3952
01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:51.950
<v Speaker 4>I almonds also.</v>

3953
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:52.840
<v Speaker 4>So I also,</v>

3954
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I get my vitamin E,</v>

3955
01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:54.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3956
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 4>mostly from,</v>

3957
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:56.750
<v Speaker 4>from plant sources.</v>

3958
01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.640
<v Speaker 4>And also I use almond milk,</v>

3959
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.620
<v Speaker 4>unsweetened almond milk in my smoothies.</v>

3960
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.221
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

3961
01:54:01.221 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I make a really big smoothie every morning,</v>

3962
01:54:02.841 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 4>which has all these different micronutrients.</v>

3963
01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3964
01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.600
<v Speaker 1>And Sweden is the key really.</v>

3965
01:54:06.601 --> 01:54:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3966
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who said,</v>

3967
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:08.101
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3968
01:54:08.101 --> 01:54:08.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3969
01:54:08.311 --> 01:54:09.001
<v Speaker 1>it looks amazing.</v>

3970
01:54:09.001 --> 01:54:09.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm not drinking milk.</v>

3971
01:54:09.601 --> 01:54:09.831
<v Speaker 1>And more,</v>

3972
01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:10.664
<v Speaker 1>I'd say so good.</v>

3973
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:11.101
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3974
01:54:11.101 --> 01:54:11.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3975
01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3976
01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:12.121
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3977
01:54:12.121 --> 01:54:13.020
<v Speaker 1>What kind of flavor is it?</v>

3978
01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:13.810
<v Speaker 1>And he was at vanilla.</v>

3979
01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Go look at the fucking label please.</v>

3980
01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3981
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.300
<v Speaker 1>what does it say as far as grams of sugar,</v>

3982
01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:18.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3983
01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:21.480
<v Speaker 1>19 grams of sugar per serving.</v>

3984
01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:21.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3985
01:54:21.791 --> 01:54:23.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to get the unsweetened,</v>

3986
01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:24.430
<v Speaker 4>you have to get the unsweetened,</v>

3987
01:54:24.431 --> 01:54:25.140
<v Speaker 4>but it has,</v>

3988
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:27.490
<v Speaker 4>it has a lot of magnesium in it and about a lot of the,</v>

3989
01:54:27.491 --> 01:54:27.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3990
01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:28.660
<v Speaker 4>the mixed vitamin E,</v>

3991
01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:29.494
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

3992
01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:30.610
<v Speaker 4>it's a good source.</v>

3993
01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.340
<v Speaker 4>So vitamin E</v>

3994
01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:34.210
<v Speaker 1>limitation in your opinion,</v>

3995
01:54:34.211 --> 01:54:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you should probably just get it from diet to make sure that your levels are a</v>

3996
01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:39.370
<v Speaker 1>normal healthy levels.</v>

3997
01:54:39.371 --> 01:54:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And then it's the balance of the different types of vitamin A's.</v>

3998
01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3999
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I prefer getting it from Diet.</v>

4000
01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:44.600
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

4001
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.680
<v Speaker 4>there are mixed tocopherols that you can buy that are low.</v>

4002
01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:51.590
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a 10 times the RDA and their mix.</v>

4003
01:54:51.591 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 4>So you're getting the gamma with the alpha.</v>

4004
01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a good source for that,</v>

4005
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:56.563
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4006
01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:59.390
<v Speaker 4>I think there's Swanson brand may have a good one.</v>

4007
01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4008
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:01.740
<v Speaker 4>is that what you mean by a yeah,</v>

4009
01:55:01.741 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 4>like a brand company.</v>

4010
01:55:02.661 --> 01:55:02.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4011
01:55:02.851 --> 01:55:05.210
<v Speaker 4>And then you know that I think that might be a one one,</v>

4012
01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.310
<v Speaker 4>I can't recall off the top of my head,</v>

4013
01:55:07.311 --> 01:55:08.930
<v Speaker 4>but they are pretty reliable in general.</v>

4014
01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:09.973
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4015
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4016
01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:12.780
<v Speaker 1>in a sense he oversimplified things,</v>

4017
01:55:12.781 --> 01:55:17.781
<v Speaker 1>but there is a danger of taking too many vitamins when you're taking vitamins,</v>

4018
01:55:18.630 --> 01:55:21.330
<v Speaker 1>like a vitamin E that could potentially,</v>

4019
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:23.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're taking one form of it,</v>

4020
01:55:23.131 --> 01:55:25.200
<v Speaker 1>that could potentially deplete your,</v>

4021
01:55:25.201 --> 01:55:25.750
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

4022
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:26.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4023
01:55:26.071 --> 01:55:26.904
<v Speaker 1>absorption of the other.</v>

4024
01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:27.451
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4025
01:55:27.451 --> 01:55:28.560
<v Speaker 4>If you're taking a really,</v>

4026
01:55:28.561 --> 01:55:31.950
<v Speaker 4>really high dose of vitamin the Alpha Tocopherol,</v>

4027
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:32.813
<v Speaker 4>vitamin E,</v>

4028
01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:33.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4029
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:36.510
<v Speaker 4>there could be a potential danger and it depleting the gamma form.</v>

4030
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:37.270
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

4031
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:39.710
<v Speaker 1>anyone know whether they're taking alpha or gamma,</v>

4032
01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:40.350
<v Speaker 1>if it just have a,</v>

4033
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.183
<v Speaker 4>if you look,</v>

4034
01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 4>if you have a vitamin e container and look on the back of it,</v>

4035
01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:45.203
<v Speaker 4>it'll say,</v>

4036
01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 4>it'll say like Alpha Tocopherol,</v>

4037
01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:48.090
<v Speaker 4>it'll say this sort,</v>

4038
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:49.950
<v Speaker 4>like it says Alpha or gamma.</v>

4039
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Most supplemental forms are Alpha.</v>

4040
01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:53.920
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4041
01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:57.600
<v Speaker 4>and that's because that's the predominant species found in tissues and in</v>

4042
01:55:57.601 --> 01:55:58.434
<v Speaker 4>plasma.</v>

4043
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.950
<v Speaker 4>So people,</v>

4044
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:59.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4045
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:00.140
<v Speaker 4>we thought it was like the,</v>

4046
01:56:00.141 --> 01:56:00.990
<v Speaker 4>the most important,</v>

4047
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:03.720
<v Speaker 4>but we found that gamma is also really important.</v>

4048
01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4049
01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:04.410
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4050
01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:06.390
<v Speaker 4>but you can buy mixed tocopherols,</v>

4051
01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:06.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4052
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:08.130
<v Speaker 4>you can buy mixed tocopherols.</v>

4053
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4054
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 4>So that is just one thing that he brought up that was incorrect.</v>

4055
01:56:12.510 --> 01:56:12.631
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4056
01:56:12.631 --> 01:56:12.931
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4057
01:56:12.931 --> 01:56:13.141
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4058
01:56:13.141 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 4>so that was one he made.</v>

4059
01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:16.620
<v Speaker 4>He said the data is clear and consistent.</v>

4060
01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 4>And for one that's anything but clear.</v>

4061
01:56:19.501 --> 01:56:22.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's lots of complex things going on and he said that it,</v>

4062
01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:22.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4063
01:56:22.921 --> 01:56:25.740
<v Speaker 4>it's clear and consistent that supplemental antioxidants cause cancer.</v>

4064
01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4065
01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.860
<v Speaker 4>there's also other studies showing that,</v>

4066
01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:29.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4067
01:56:29.131 --> 01:56:29.964
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

4068
01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:30.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4069
01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:32.270
<v Speaker 4>p profit of PR in,</v>

4070
01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:33.900
<v Speaker 4>in the case of prostate cancer,</v>

4071
01:56:33.901 --> 01:56:35.580
<v Speaker 4>if you look at their blood levels of Alpha,</v>

4072
01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:36.840
<v Speaker 4>tocopherol and gamma,</v>

4073
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:40.140
<v Speaker 4>those with the highest levels of Alpha and gamma have the least,</v>

4074
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:40.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4075
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:41.520
<v Speaker 4>prostate cancer incidents.</v>

4076
01:56:41.521 --> 01:56:45.780
<v Speaker 4>So there's inconsistency in terms of what exactly is going on and we're still</v>

4077
01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:47.050
<v Speaker 4>really understanding all the muck,</v>

4078
01:56:47.070 --> 01:56:48.810
<v Speaker 4>trying to understand all the mechanisms at play.</v>

4079
01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:49.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4080
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:50.623
<v Speaker 4>but he also,</v>

4081
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:55.710
<v Speaker 4>he also made the overgeneralization and that taking supplemental antioxidants is</v>

4082
01:56:55.711 --> 01:56:59.160
<v Speaker 4>bad because you need pro oxidants to kill cancer cells.</v>

4083
01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:03.540
<v Speaker 4>And that was like the second part of his why supplemental antioxidants are bad.</v>

4084
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:05.100
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4085
01:57:05.101 --> 01:57:07.440
<v Speaker 4>this is another example of context.</v>

4086
01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:08.910
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

4087
01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:09.773
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

4088
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have enough of the Alpha Gamma Tocopherols,</v>

4089
01:57:14.101 --> 01:57:16.410
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to have increased DNA damage.</v>

4090
01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.453
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have,</v>

4091
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:17.971
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4092
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:21.860
<v Speaker 4>things that caused mutations and what happened.</v>

4093
01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:22.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4094
01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.960
<v Speaker 4>what happens is you're going to,</v>

4095
01:57:23.961 --> 01:57:24.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4096
01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 4>accumulate that over time and that's going to lead to cancer.</v>

4097
01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:28.890
<v Speaker 4>So not having enough of this vitamin D is not good.</v>

4098
01:57:28.891 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>

4099
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:31.050
<v Speaker 4>60% of the population doesn't have enough.</v>

4100
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4101
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:32.910
<v Speaker 4>but the flip side is,</v>

4102
01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 4>is that if you already have cancer,</v>

4103
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 4>then taking supplemental vitamin E,</v>

4104
01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:38.731
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4105
01:57:38.731 --> 01:57:41.520
<v Speaker 4>what happens is because it prevents that oxidation,</v>

4106
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:42.930
<v Speaker 4>then you,</v>

4107
01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4108
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:46.500
<v Speaker 4>there's mechanisms in your body that induce cell death.</v>

4109
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 4>When you have oxidation,</v>

4110
01:57:48.031 --> 01:57:48.771
<v Speaker 4>when you have this damage,</v>

4111
01:57:48.771 --> 01:57:52.710
<v Speaker 4>sturdy DNA tumor suppressor genes get activated and they kill the cell.</v>

4112
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.870
<v Speaker 4>So what they've shown is that in mice,</v>

4113
01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:56.130
<v Speaker 4>if you take mice that already,</v>

4114
01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:59.070
<v Speaker 4>if you give him cancer and you'd give them supplemental vitamin E,</v>

4115
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.830
<v Speaker 4>you can attenuate that whole pathway,</v>

4116
01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:03.570
<v Speaker 4>that that activates the cell,</v>

4117
01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.250
<v Speaker 4>the death of these cancer cells.</v>

4118
01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4119
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.690
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the case.</v>

4120
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:07.321
<v Speaker 4>If you take a mouse,</v>

4121
01:58:07.321 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have cancer and you give them vitamin E,</v>

4122
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 4>it actually prevents the DNA damage.</v>

4123
01:58:10.710 --> 01:58:12.990
<v Speaker 4>So this is a case where you're looking at context.</v>

4124
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:14.580
<v Speaker 4>So someone that doesn't have,</v>

4125
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4126
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:17.340
<v Speaker 4>that is not,</v>

4127
01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have cancer on their body.</v>

4128
01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.930
<v Speaker 4>You want to make sure the not causing DNA damage,</v>

4129
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 4>which is happening,</v>

4130
01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:23.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4131
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:26.370
<v Speaker 4>every second by making sure they have enough of these antioxidants.</v>

4132
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.600
<v Speaker 4>But on the flip side of that,</v>

4133
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:27.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4134
01:58:27.781 --> 01:58:28.740
<v Speaker 4>if you already have cancer,</v>

4135
01:58:28.741 --> 01:58:33.050
<v Speaker 4>taking a bunch of supplemental vitamin E is not a good thing because you</v>

4136
01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:33.541
<v Speaker 4>couldn't attend.</v>

4137
01:58:33.541 --> 01:58:36.870
<v Speaker 4>You wait that pathway that is important to kill cancer cells.</v>

4138
01:58:37.170 --> 01:58:39.870
<v Speaker 4>So it's another thing where it's like context is so important.</v>

4139
01:58:39.871 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 4>You need to differentiate people that</v>

4140
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.150
<v Speaker 2>are normal,</v>

4141
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 2>healthy and people that are trying to prevent themselves from getting cancer by</v>

4142
01:58:46.391 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 2>preventing these things that cause cancer,</v>

4143
01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:52.330
<v Speaker 2>which vitamin E can help prevent versus talking about someone that already has</v>

4144
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:53.140
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

4145
01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just incredibly irresponsible to make a simplified version of</v>

4146
01:58:58.481 --> 01:59:02.290
<v Speaker 2>these incredibly complex processes that are going on.</v>

4147
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:03.161
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion.</v>

4148
01:59:03.161 --> 01:59:03.994
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4149
01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:04.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4150
01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.201
<v Speaker 2>it's a big,</v>

4151
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:07.170
<v Speaker 2>big overgeneralization and uh,</v>

4152
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:12.180
<v Speaker 2>it's probably because dive in deep into this stuff is it takes time and it's</v>

4153
01:59:14.081 --> 01:59:16.720
<v Speaker 2>complex and you need to understand how some of these things are interacting and</v>

4154
01:59:16.721 --> 01:59:17.410
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>

4155
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:17.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4156
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:19.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's much easier to be like,</v>

4157
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:20.141
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4158
01:59:20.141 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 2>you read,</v>

4159
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you read the study,</v>

4160
01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:22.870
<v Speaker 2>the conclusions and Oh yeah,</v>

4161
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:23.733
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

4162
01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:27.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that people love to the love when someone can break it down and</v>

4163
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:27.880
<v Speaker 2>the clear sentence.</v>

4164
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Antioxidants can cause cancer while let me get on Twitter and let everybody know</v>

4165
01:59:32.201 --> 01:59:33.250
<v Speaker 2>that they're being an idiot.</v>

4166
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4167
01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean people love doing that.</v>

4168
01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 2>They love saying things like that.</v>

4169
01:59:37.391 --> 01:59:38.320
<v Speaker 2>That like a nice,</v>

4170
01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:39.161
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>

4171
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:39.994
<v Speaker 2>concise,</v>

4172
01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:41.290
<v Speaker 2>easy to digest.</v>

4173
01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:41.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4174
01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:42.790
<v Speaker 2>a low,</v>

4175
01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 2>high alkaline diet kills cancer.</v>

4176
01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:46.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4177
01:59:46.361 --> 01:59:47.051
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know.</v>

4178
01:59:47.051 --> 01:59:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going fucking me.</v>

4179
01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there was any possible way I could boil that down into like one</v>

4180
01:59:52.631 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 2>sentence didn't seem like it could.</v>

4181
01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Biology is very complex and trying to oversimplify it isn't necessarily a meat.</v>

4182
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily mean you have a good understanding of the complexities.</v>

4183
02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.610
<v Speaker 2>This is certainly going to be a podcast.</v>

4184
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It requires a notepad.</v>

4185
02:00:08.490 --> 02:00:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4186
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I have to do a lot of googling.</v>

4187
02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4188
02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.633
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4189
02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4190
02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:12.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4191
02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 2>the whole Alpha Tocopherol and gamma tocopherol it's,</v>

4192
02:00:16.330 --> 02:00:18.190
<v Speaker 2>it's something I think is important for people to,</v>

4193
02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>to understand.</v>

4194
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4195
02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:20.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4196
02:00:20.891 --> 02:00:23.440
<v Speaker 2>it is Alpha Tocopherol is the major supplemental form.</v>

4197
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:28.470
<v Speaker 2>And the last study I show sauce said something about like 11% of the population</v>

4198
02:00:28.901 --> 02:00:31.920
<v Speaker 2>takes high levels of Alpha Tocopherol.</v>

4199
02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:32.831
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

4200
02:00:32.831 --> 02:00:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you have a certain percent of the population that's going overboard and they</v>

4201
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 2>probably don't know about the effects that that's going on.</v>

4202
02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:40.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4203
02:00:40.421 --> 02:00:40.611
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4204
02:00:40.611 --> 02:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>the depletion of their gamma and how that can be bad.</v>

4205
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 2>So I think it is important for those people to realize that.</v>

4206
02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:47.800
<v Speaker 2>But the flip side,</v>

4207
02:00:47.801 --> 02:00:47.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4208
02:00:47.981 --> 02:00:48.940
<v Speaker 2>someone like off it,</v>

4209
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:53.920
<v Speaker 2>his solution to that is he wants to have high dose vitamins,</v>

4210
02:00:53.921 --> 02:00:58.921
<v Speaker 2>FDA regulated so that people like him who happened MD can prescribe them.</v>

4211
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And so that's his solution to,</v>

4212
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4213
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:05.660
<v Speaker 2>high dose vitamins and yeah,</v>

4214
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4215
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.233
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it,</v>

4216
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:08.913
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4217
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you know who's going to define what a high dose is.</v>

4218
02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it the RDA?</v>

4219
02:01:12.581 --> 02:01:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at something like vitamin D,</v>

4220
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4221
02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:20.580
<v Speaker 2>but right now the RDA for vitamin D is like 600 Ius a day and 70% of the</v>

4222
02:01:21.071 --> 02:01:25.030
<v Speaker 2>population doesn't have enough vitamin D and taking 600 I use a day if you're</v>

4223
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:26.110
<v Speaker 2>deficient,</v>

4224
02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:28.000
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to get you to an adequate level.</v>

4225
02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:29.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a good level.</v>

4226
02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.880
<v Speaker 2>What is a good level of vitamin D?</v>

4227
02:01:30.881 --> 02:01:33.850
<v Speaker 2>If 600 is not an accurate level,</v>

4228
02:01:33.851 --> 02:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>what's a,</v>

4229
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:35.200
<v Speaker 2>what's an accurate level?</v>

4230
02:01:35.230 --> 02:01:35.621
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4231
02:01:35.621 --> 02:01:35.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4232
02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>in a couple of studies that I've read where people that were deficient in</v>

4233
02:01:39.381 --> 02:01:40.214
<v Speaker 2>vitamin D,</v>

4234
02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:40.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4235
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>took 4,000 Ius a day for a year.</v>

4236
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>That was enough to get them up to 30 nanograms per milliliter,</v>

4237
02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>which was a year.</v>

4238
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:50.473
<v Speaker 2>It took a year.</v>

4239
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4240
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:52.300
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>

4241
02:01:52.301 --> 02:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>it takes a long,</v>

4242
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4243
02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.291
<v Speaker 2>well they did.</v>

4244
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>They measured it after a year.</v>

4245
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

4246
02:01:56.510 --> 02:02:00.230
<v Speaker 2>it's possible if they had done some time points maybe in between,</v>

4247
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4248
02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.010
<v Speaker 2>that it,</v>

4249
02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:04.450
<v Speaker 2>it could have raised their levels higher than that,</v>

4250
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:07.940
<v Speaker 2>a slow absorption into the body or something.</v>

4251
02:02:07.941 --> 02:02:08.091
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4252
02:02:08.091 --> 02:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>why would it take so long to,</v>

4253
02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:10.670
<v Speaker 2>to get the levels,</v>

4254
02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's going to take a year,</v>

4255
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just the way the study was designed.</v>

4256
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>They measured it a year later.</v>

4257
02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4258
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4259
02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.313
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4260
02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4261
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that didn't take a year,</v>

4262
02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>but the study was that they looked at it a year later after taking a year of a</v>

4263
02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:25.971
<v Speaker 2>4,000,</v>

4264
02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:26.880
<v Speaker 2>nine years day.</v>

4265
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.270
<v Speaker 2>But that was enough.</v>

4266
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4267
02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I think generally speaking,</v>

4268
02:02:29.811 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4269
02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:35.320
<v Speaker 2>people that are supplementing between 2000 and 4,000 I use generally tend to</v>

4270
02:02:36.171 --> 02:02:38.600
<v Speaker 2>have adequate levels if they're not severely,</v>

4271
02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:40.130
<v Speaker 2>severely deficient to start with.</v>

4272
02:02:40.610 --> 02:02:41.331
<v Speaker 2>If you're severely,</v>

4273
02:02:41.331 --> 02:02:41.991
<v Speaker 2>severely division,</v>

4274
02:02:41.991 --> 02:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>it can take longer to get up to an adequate status.</v>

4275
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:46.400
<v Speaker 2>What are the other things that,</v>

4276
02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:48.970
<v Speaker 2>off it said that you didn't think were,</v>

4277
02:02:48.971 --> 02:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4278
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:52.310
<v Speaker 2>were accurate or were problematic?</v>

4279
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4280
02:02:52.821 --> 02:02:57.821
<v Speaker 2>So he also said that the data is clear and consistent that supplemental vitamins</v>

4281
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:00.110
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything.</v>

4282
02:03:00.110 --> 02:03:02.210
<v Speaker 2>There's no positive benefit from them.</v>

4283
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.051
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said,</v>

4284
02:03:03.051 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 2>no positive benefit.</v>

4285
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:05.510
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

4286
02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:06.141
<v Speaker 2>to his credit,</v>

4287
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't read his book,</v>

4288
02:03:07.041 --> 02:03:11.330
<v Speaker 2>so maybe he goes into some specifics that I'm not aware of.</v>

4289
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.433
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

4290
02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:17.420
<v Speaker 2>to say that supplemental vitamins have no benefit is like really,</v>

4291
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4292
02:03:18.111 --> 02:03:18.944
<v Speaker 2>I mean they've done,</v>

4293
02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:23.030
<v Speaker 2>they've even done randomized controlled trials showing that Omega three fatty</v>

4294
02:03:23.031 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 2>acid supplementation supplementation lowers all cause mortality.</v>

4295
02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.660
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

4296
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:33.290
<v Speaker 2>supplementing and he actually refers to omega three fatty acids as an</v>

4297
02:03:33.291 --> 02:03:34.124
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant,</v>

4298
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.720
<v Speaker 2>at least in that podcast he did.</v>

4299
02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 2>So you know that that's one thing.</v>

4300
02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin D supplements,</v>

4301
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:44.600
<v Speaker 2>people that are supplemented with vitamin D two 1500 ius a day.</v>

4302
02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4303
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how long they did that for it,</v>

4304
02:03:47.051 --> 02:03:48.470
<v Speaker 2>but they had a 17,</v>

4305
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>it was many years that there was a 17% decrease in cancer cancer risk and there</v>

4306
02:03:54.561 --> 02:03:59.561
<v Speaker 2>was a 30% decrease in cancer mortality and like a 40% decrease in,</v>

4307
02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.380
<v Speaker 2>in camp,</v>

4308
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:00.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4309
02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 2>cancers of the digestive system including colon cancer.</v>

4310
02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's one for vitamin D.</v>

4311
02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:08.563
<v Speaker 2>Alycia what's another one?</v>

4312
02:04:08.690 --> 02:04:11.600
<v Speaker 2>There was another study where they looked at a multivitamin that took</v>

4313
02:04:11.601 --> 02:04:13.640
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin and a,</v>

4314
02:04:13.641 --> 02:04:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but this was not a controlled trial.</v>

4315
02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:15.793
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>

4316
02:04:15.970 --> 02:04:19.550
<v Speaker 2>they did questionnaire and found out like how many,</v>

4317
02:04:19.551 --> 02:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>how frequently women took multivitamins and how,</v>

4318
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:23.690
<v Speaker 2>how many times a day or how,</v>

4319
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:25.250
<v Speaker 2>how many days a week they took them.</v>

4320
02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 2>And what they found is that the ones that took vitamins on a daily basis had the</v>

4321
02:04:29.901 --> 02:04:31.670
<v Speaker 2>longest telomeres they measured to them or length.</v>

4322
02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's another one,</v>

4323
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:34.940
<v Speaker 2>a magnesium.</v>

4324
02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:36.110
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about,</v>

4325
02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:36.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4326
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>taking supplemental vitamins helps you fill some of those nutritional gaps that</v>

4327
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting from your diet.</v>

4328
02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:43.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4329
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and the reality is is that we're not getting a lot of those vitamins and</v>

4330
02:04:47.251 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>minerals from our diet.</v>

4331
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this a little bit when it's possible to eat a completely healthy</v>

4332
02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.000
<v Speaker 2>diet and get everything you need,</v>

4333
02:04:54.001 --> 02:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>or do you need to supplement?</v>

4334
02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:57.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4335
02:04:57.061 --> 02:04:58.020
<v Speaker 2>is it possible?</v>

4336
02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

4337
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:00.533
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4338
02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean like things like vitamin D,</v>

4339
02:05:02.521 --> 02:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>what would you have to demean?</v>

4340
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I know some milk you'd half well supple yet for vitamin D,</v>

4341
02:05:07.621 --> 02:05:12.621
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to really be living in a place that was exposed to the UBB during</v>

4342
02:05:12.871 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 2>winter and summer and you'd have to be out in the sun for 15 minutes,</v>

4343
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:17.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4344
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:18.450
<v Speaker 2>cause getting it from fish,</v>

4345
02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 2>well maybe fish has a a good,</v>

4346
02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:21.571
<v Speaker 2>good bit of it,</v>

4347
02:05:21.571 --> 02:05:25.860
<v Speaker 2>but you'd have to eat fish every day and also to get the Omega threes you'd have</v>

4348
02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:27.040
<v Speaker 2>to eat fish like everyday.</v>

4349
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.421
<v Speaker 2>They don't make it.</v>

4350
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Three fatty acids are another big one and you'd have to eat quite a bit of fish,</v>

4351
02:05:30.901 --> 02:05:31.141
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4352
02:05:31.141 --> 02:05:31.861
<v Speaker 2>In certain fish,</v>

4353
02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:32.581
<v Speaker 2>like salmon,</v>

4354
02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:32.881
<v Speaker 2>salmon,</v>

4355
02:05:32.881 --> 02:05:33.571
<v Speaker 2>like fatty fish.</v>

4356
02:05:33.571 --> 02:05:33.871
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4357
02:05:33.871 --> 02:05:34.321
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

4358
02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:35.700
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to eat like fatty fish.</v>

4359
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.690
<v Speaker 2>So I think it would be really difficult.</v>

4360
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I personally,</v>

4361
02:05:40.861 --> 02:05:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I tr I agree with,</v>

4362
02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 2>with Offit and uh,</v>

4363
02:05:44.311 --> 02:05:48.180
<v Speaker 2>that goofball downing in some instances where you know,</v>

4364
02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:49.043
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4365
02:05:49.770 --> 02:05:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you should try to get all your micronutrients much as you can from your diet.</v>

4366
02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:55.133
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

4367
02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:55.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4368
02:05:55.561 --> 02:05:56.251
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

4369
02:05:56.251 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 2>case and point my,</v>

4370
02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:57.990
<v Speaker 2>I do my smoothie.</v>

4371
02:05:57.991 --> 02:05:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4372
02:05:58.410 --> 02:05:58.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4373
02:05:58.651 --> 02:05:58.871
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4374
02:05:58.871 --> 02:06:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I definitely try to eat my greens and healthy,</v>

4375
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:02.610
<v Speaker 2>healthy meats and fish.</v>

4376
02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I really like fish,</v>

4377
02:06:03.810 --> 02:06:04.980
<v Speaker 2>but I do supplement,</v>

4378
02:06:05.010 --> 02:06:05.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4379
02:06:05.341 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I take omega three fatty acids,</v>

4380
02:06:06.991 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 2>I take vitamin D,</v>

4381
02:06:08.041 --> 02:06:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I take a Multivitamin,</v>

4382
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.411
<v Speaker 2>which has my,</v>

4383
02:06:10.411 --> 02:06:10.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4384
02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:12.630
<v Speaker 2>selenium and some of my trace elements,</v>

4385
02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>my iodine and uh,</v>

4386
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>what else do I take a,</v>

4387
02:06:16.770 --> 02:06:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I also take a B complex,</v>

4388
02:06:17.971 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 2>even though most people aren't,</v>

4389
02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:21.930
<v Speaker 2>they don't have low levels of,</v>

4390
02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:24.360
<v Speaker 2>of the B vitamins due to like fortification and stuff.</v>

4391
02:06:24.361 --> 02:06:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Now I actually take a B complex because,</v>

4392
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:28.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4393
02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it's really kind of interesting,</v>

4394
02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:31.420
<v Speaker 2>but we are,</v>

4395
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:33.360
<v Speaker 2>our lab has shown that,</v>

4396
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4397
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.090
<v Speaker 2>it's partly shown this,</v>

4398
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:37.990
<v Speaker 2>that as we age I,</v>

4399
02:06:37.991 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I talked about how your lipid membranes get more rigid and a lot of,</v>

4400
02:06:42.181 --> 02:06:44.100
<v Speaker 2>so this includes your mitochondrial membranes.</v>

4401
02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 2>They get more stiff and uh,</v>

4402
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:47.730
<v Speaker 2>over time what happens is,</v>

4403
02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4404
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:51.540
<v Speaker 2>metabolites and stuff can't get transported as easy.</v>

4405
02:06:51.541 --> 02:06:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And also what happens is these proteins there,</v>

4406
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:58.140
<v Speaker 2>they bind co factors like B vitamins are really important for a lot of proteins.</v>

4407
02:06:58.141 --> 02:07:02.010
<v Speaker 2>In the Mitochondria that are necessary for metabolism to generate ATP.</v>

4408
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:06.030
<v Speaker 2>And these proteins required B vitamins and a lot of them are embedded in the</v>

4409
02:07:06.031 --> 02:07:06.511
<v Speaker 2>membrane.</v>

4410
02:07:06.511 --> 02:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>So when the membrane gets stiff,</v>

4411
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the protein binding constant changes to that B vitamin and it's been shown that</v>

4412
02:07:13.441 --> 02:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>you can overcome that,</v>

4413
02:07:14.590 --> 02:07:16.200
<v Speaker 2>meaning you actually can overcome that,</v>

4414
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4415
02:07:16.610 --> 02:07:19.860
<v Speaker 2>it messing up that binding constant because it screws up the structure of the</v>

4416
02:07:19.861 --> 02:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>protein by increasing the level of B vitamins.</v>

4417
02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:24.560
<v Speaker 2>So what level to do recommend?</v>

4418
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

4419
02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:25.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4420
02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

4421
02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:30.300
<v Speaker 2>what's The u s the Rda and what do you think should for B vitamins?</v>

4422
02:07:30.301 --> 02:07:30.571
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4423
02:07:30.571 --> 02:07:31.404
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4424
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.470
<v Speaker 2>there's no telling what it should be there.</v>

4425
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.320
<v Speaker 2>There's just no empirical data to show,</v>

4426
02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:36.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4427
02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:39.150
<v Speaker 2>how much more you would need to a much come back.</v>

4428
02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I have a B complex and I just can't recall off the top of my head what all the,</v>

4429
02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>cause there's so many of the,</v>

4430
02:07:44.951 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 2>of the B vitamins.</v>

4431
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what the name of your B complexes that you take right now?</v>

4432
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Right now I have one from vitacost,</v>

4433
02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:58.051
<v Speaker 2>but I've been switching over to Swanson brand because I spelled out Swanson like</v>

4434
02:07:58.810 --> 02:08:00.850
<v Speaker 2>w a n s o n.</v>

4435
02:08:01.090 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

4436
02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty reliable.</v>

4437
02:08:02.711 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 2>They've been around for a really long time.</v>

4438
02:08:05.171 --> 02:08:05.381
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4439
02:08:05.381 --> 02:08:05.620
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4440
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.820
<v Speaker 2>they generally have some,</v>

4441
02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 2>some reliables I supplements for Omega Three.</v>

4442
02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I like Nordic naturals.</v>

4443
02:08:11.490 --> 02:08:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4444
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>they're really good in Nordic naturals.</v>

4445
02:08:13.661 --> 02:08:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4446
02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:14.501
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

4447
02:08:14.501 --> 02:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4448
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:15.160
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4449
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.180
<v Speaker 2>that's a fish bait.</v>

4450
02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:16.901
<v Speaker 2>Fish oil.</v>

4451
02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:18.490
<v Speaker 2>So there's some oils.</v>

4452
02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.281
<v Speaker 5>Here's the,</v>

4453
02:08:19.281 --> 02:08:19.791
<v Speaker 5>here's the,</v>

4454
02:08:19.791 --> 02:08:20.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm the Swanson.</v>

4455
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:22.420
<v Speaker 5>It has [inaudible],</v>

4456
02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:23.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4457
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.110
<v Speaker 5>25,</v>

4458
02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:24.973
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4459
02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:27.320
<v Speaker 5>25 milligrams of Riboflavin,</v>

4460
02:08:27.321 --> 02:08:31.300
<v Speaker 5>which is 1471% of the U.</v>

4461
02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:33.910
<v Speaker 5>S r d a thigh Amanu Simon,</v>

4462
02:08:33.970 --> 02:08:34.460
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>

4463
02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:35.150
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>

4464
02:08:35.150 --> 02:08:35.751
<v Speaker 5>Simon,</v>

4465
02:08:35.751 --> 02:08:36.860
<v Speaker 5>which is B one.</v>

4466
02:08:36.861 --> 02:08:38.150
<v Speaker 5>It does 25 milligrams,</v>

4467
02:08:38.151 --> 02:08:41.720
<v Speaker 5>which is 1667% of the U.</v>

4468
02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.553
<v Speaker 5>S r d a,</v>

4469
02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:43.610
<v Speaker 5>vitamin C.</v>

4470
02:08:43.611 --> 02:08:45.540
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't been as well in the B complex.</v>

4471
02:08:45.541 --> 02:08:46.221
<v Speaker 5>So it was vitamin C,</v>

4472
02:08:46.221 --> 02:08:46.890
<v Speaker 5>which is interesting.</v>

4473
02:08:46.890 --> 02:08:47.450
<v Speaker 5>As you're saying,</v>

4474
02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:51.410
<v Speaker 5>833% of the US RDA and the other big one,</v>

4475
02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:57.040
<v Speaker 5>vitamin B six is 1250% and vitamin B,</v>

4476
02:08:57.801 --> 02:09:01.380
<v Speaker 5>12 2080 3% of us RDA.</v>

4477
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:02.413
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>

4478
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:03.560
<v Speaker 5>I've always found that interesting.</v>

4479
02:09:03.561 --> 02:09:04.790
<v Speaker 5>When you look at some vitamins,</v>

4480
02:09:04.791 --> 02:09:06.290
<v Speaker 5>you look at multivitamins and you know,</v>

4481
02:09:06.291 --> 02:09:10.400
<v Speaker 5>you know what the RDA is and you see their percentages fucking off the charts.</v>

4482
02:09:10.401 --> 02:09:10.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4483
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:14.060
<v Speaker 5>They have 2000% of the U Rda has be 12.</v>

4484
02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:14.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4485
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4486
02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.400
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is a knucklehead.</v>

4487
02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:18.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what they're saying.</v>

4488
02:09:18.691 --> 02:09:19.524
<v Speaker 2>And their company,</v>

4489
02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:20.483
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

4490
02:09:20.730 --> 02:09:21.490
<v Speaker 2>fuck them.</v>

4491
02:09:21.490 --> 02:09:22.610
<v Speaker 2>In the case of item a,</v>

4492
02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:23.580
<v Speaker 2>the B vitamins,</v>

4493
02:09:23.581 --> 02:09:23.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4494
02:09:23.821 --> 02:09:24.271
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

4495
02:09:24.271 --> 02:09:25.230
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>

4496
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:26.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4497
02:09:26.250 --> 02:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>

4498
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:28.180
<v Speaker 2>aren't deficient and,</v>

4499
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>and they haven't really shown any toxicity of and taking too much of these B</v>

4500
02:09:32.941 --> 02:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and they are water soluble.</v>

4501
02:09:34.591 --> 02:09:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So you end up duping your being and all that.</v>

4502
02:09:36.330 --> 02:09:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I personally,</v>

4503
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4504
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking them just because I've seen,</v>

4505
02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:40.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4506
02:09:40.561 --> 02:09:44.130
<v Speaker 2>some of this data where it shows that some of these proteins that are when</v>

4507
02:09:44.131 --> 02:09:47.580
<v Speaker 2>you're a member let your lipid biolayer is kind of more rigid and gets screwed</v>

4508
02:09:47.581 --> 02:09:47.741
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

4509
02:09:47.741 --> 02:09:48.540
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4510
02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:52.320
<v Speaker 2>over time and also when your oxidation does that are eating rancid fat,</v>

4511
02:09:52.321 --> 02:09:53.154
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

4512
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4513
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:56.670
<v Speaker 2>change is some of the structure of those membrane proteins that require B</v>

4514
02:09:56.671 --> 02:09:57.211
<v Speaker 2>vitamins.</v>

4515
02:09:57.211 --> 02:09:58.080
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

4516
02:09:58.110 --> 02:10:00.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much more you need there.</v>

4517
02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:02.010
<v Speaker 2>It'd be cool to do a study to figure that out,</v>

4518
02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:04.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a dangerous one because they're water soluble.</v>

4519
02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:05.873
<v Speaker 2>It's an it ha.</v>

4520
02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any data that shows it to,</v>

4521
02:10:07.911 --> 02:10:10.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a dangerous one for one because they are water soluble and you pee them</v>

4522
02:10:10.741 --> 02:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

4523
02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:13.530
<v Speaker 2>What are the fat soluble ones that we should be careful about?</v>

4524
02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Overdosing Alpha Tocopherol is one.</v>

4525
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4526
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4527
02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.181
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

4528
02:10:18.181 --> 02:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>the whole interplay between the gamma and Alpha,</v>

4529
02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:21.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4530
02:10:21.511 --> 02:10:22.060
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

4531
02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:22.681
<v Speaker 2>so gamma,</v>

4532
02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:23.311
<v Speaker 2>Tocopherol,</v>

4533
02:10:23.311 --> 02:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Alpha Tocopherol,</v>

4534
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:24.750
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

4535
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:25.441
<v Speaker 2>all the ease.</v>

4536
02:10:25.441 --> 02:10:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Those are fat soluble,</v>

4537
02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:26.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4538
02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:29.030
<v Speaker 2>He also should be careful.</v>

4539
02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin D you can,</v>

4540
02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:31.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4541
02:10:31.591 --> 02:10:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you can't take too much.</v>

4542
02:10:32.701 --> 02:10:32.791
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4543
02:10:32.791 --> 02:10:33.170
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4544
02:10:33.170 --> 02:10:34.003
<v Speaker 2>if you take</v>

4545
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.200
<v Speaker 4>the toxicity levels that,</v>

4546
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:41.260
<v Speaker 4>that I've seen have been shown that like 10,000 Ius a day for some time that,</v>

4547
02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.430
<v Speaker 4>anything over that,</v>

4548
02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:46.190
<v Speaker 4>and actually I think it even is quite higher than that.</v>

4549
02:10:46.191 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 4>But that's the limit of toxicity.</v>

4550
02:10:48.190 --> 02:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>What about a mega threes and Omega threes in plant based form versus in fish</v>

4551
02:10:54.371 --> 02:10:55.180
<v Speaker 1>form?</v>

4552
02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:56.013
<v Speaker 4>Great question.</v>

4553
02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:58.630
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the,</v>

4554
02:10:58.631 --> 02:10:58.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4555
02:10:58.900 --> 02:10:59.870
<v Speaker 4>so meg us,</v>

4556
02:10:59.910 --> 02:11:00.670
<v Speaker 4>there's three,</v>

4557
02:11:00.670 --> 02:11:01.690
<v Speaker 4>there's EPA,</v>

4558
02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:03.760
<v Speaker 4>there's Dha and Ala.</v>

4559
02:11:04.210 --> 02:11:09.210
<v Speaker 4>So the major plant form like flaxseed oil or flax seed walnuts for example,</v>

4560
02:11:11.590 --> 02:11:13.060
<v Speaker 4>have Ala.</v>

4561
02:11:13.630 --> 02:11:14.051
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4562
02:11:14.051 --> 02:11:14.830
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

4563
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:17.230
<v Speaker 4>they don't have EPA or Dha.</v>

4564
02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Now you can convert a very small percentage of a l a l a n to the EPA,</v>

4565
02:11:23.591 --> 02:11:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's like 5% of it.</v>

4566
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:28.840
<v Speaker 4>It's very inefficient conversion.</v>

4567
02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:29.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4568
02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:32.800
<v Speaker 4>and women may be able to do a little bit better of a conversion.</v>

4569
02:11:32.801 --> 02:11:34.480
<v Speaker 4>I can't recall off the top of my head what their number was.</v>

4570
02:11:34.481 --> 02:11:36.430
<v Speaker 4>But the point is is that um,</v>

4571
02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:42.280
<v Speaker 4>if your only source of Omega three is flax or you know,</v>

4572
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:43.143
<v Speaker 4>walnuts,</v>

4573
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:45.070
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting your Dha,</v>

4574
02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.180
<v Speaker 4>you hear that vegans.</v>

4575
02:11:46.330 --> 02:11:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4576
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:48.550
<v Speaker 4>that's really I the vegans.</v>

4577
02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.050
<v Speaker 4>If you're a Vegan,</v>

4578
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:53.650
<v Speaker 4>really I just micro algae oil.</v>

4579
02:11:53.651 --> 02:11:55.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean the phytoplankton are essentially,</v>

4580
02:11:55.781 --> 02:11:57.430
<v Speaker 4>or what making these Omega three is to fish,</v>

4581
02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:01.420
<v Speaker 4>eat the phytoplankton and gets contract and fat micro algae oil.</v>

4582
02:12:01.690 --> 02:12:03.670
<v Speaker 4>I recommend for people that are vegetarian,</v>

4583
02:12:03.671 --> 02:12:04.180
<v Speaker 4>Vegan,</v>

4584
02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Michael algae oil and,</v>

4585
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:10.950
<v Speaker 1>but when you're eating micro algae oil [inaudible] totally constitutes Vegan.</v>

4586
02:12:11.291 --> 02:12:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there any sort of animal protein and micro algae oil?</v>

4587
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.600
<v Speaker 4>I guess your,</v>

4588
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:15.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4589
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:19.580
<v Speaker 4>well they're phyto plankton so if you're vegan based off of philosophy where you</v>

4590
02:12:19.581 --> 02:12:21.740
<v Speaker 4>don't want to eat like any type of creature.</v>

4591
02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4592
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:24.110
<v Speaker 4>phytoplankton is Fido creature.</v>

4593
02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:24.831
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

4594
02:12:24.831 --> 02:12:27.450
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a great teacher.</v>

4595
02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.060
<v Speaker 4>But so that,</v>

4596
02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.320
<v Speaker 4>I guess that could be a problem.</v>

4597
02:12:30.321 --> 02:12:31.490
<v Speaker 4>But if you are doing,</v>

4598
02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 4>if you're a vegetarian or Vegan for health purposes and there's not like a</v>

4599
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:39.120
<v Speaker 4>philosophical component where you know,</v>

4600
02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you have a problem with eating the spider plankton,</v>

4601
02:12:41.751 --> 02:12:42.260
<v Speaker 4>then</v>

4602
02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>well shamine vegans shouldn't avoid.</v>

4603
02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4604
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certain probiotics that are,</v>

4605
02:12:47.331 --> 02:12:47.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4606
02:12:47.511 --> 02:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a creature to</v>

4607
02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:50.383
<v Speaker 4>true</v>

4608
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:52.483
<v Speaker 4>living life.</v>

4609
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:53.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4610
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:53.800
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4611
02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:54.411
<v Speaker 4>that's a good point.</v>

4612
02:12:54.411 --> 02:12:54.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4613
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:55.700
<v Speaker 4>But they move,</v>

4614
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:56.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>

4615
02:12:56.181 --> 02:12:57.080
<v Speaker 4>they're active,</v>

4616
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 4>they're active.</v>

4617
02:12:58.480 --> 02:12:59.320
<v Speaker 4>They are absolutely.</v>

4618
02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Just because you can't see them.</v>

4619
02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:01.011
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

4620
02:13:01.011 --> 02:13:03.260
<v Speaker 4>you're basically in little tiny turtles or something,</v>

4621
02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:04.483
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4622
02:13:04.670 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

4623
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:07.400
<v Speaker 4>So the little moving thing,</v>

4624
02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:07.940
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4625
02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:08.331
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4626
02:13:08.331 --> 02:13:10.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the philosophy,</v>

4627
02:13:10.341 --> 02:13:13.940
<v Speaker 4>because I don't have a lot of Vegan friends and it's really no cut those people</v>

4628
02:13:13.941 --> 02:13:14.750
<v Speaker 4>out of your life.</v>

4629
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:15.583
<v Speaker 4>It's very important.</v>

4630
02:13:15.590 --> 02:13:16.700
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] against them.</v>

4631
02:13:16.701 --> 02:13:17.280
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

4632
02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:17.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4633
02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.600
<v Speaker 4>either by like fucking with them.</v>

4634
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:20.360
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4635
02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:21.111
<v Speaker 4>but the Omega three,</v>

4636
02:13:21.111 --> 02:13:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Dha and EPA are really important.</v>

4637
02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:24.561
<v Speaker 4>They're really,</v>

4638
02:13:24.561 --> 02:13:25.281
<v Speaker 4>really important.</v>

4639
02:13:25.281 --> 02:13:26.120
<v Speaker 4>And so you asked,</v>

4640
02:13:26.121 --> 02:13:27.440
<v Speaker 4>can you take too much?</v>

4641
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean for one,</v>

4642
02:13:29.230 --> 02:13:29.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4643
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:30.830
<v Speaker 4>EPA is a very,</v>

4644
02:13:30.831 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 4>it's got a very</v>

4645
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.900
<v Speaker 2>potent anti inflammatory effect,</v>

4646
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>which is you know,</v>

4647
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:37.260
<v Speaker 2>important for a variety of different mechanisms.</v>

4648
02:13:37.261 --> 02:13:37.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4649
02:13:37.561 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>

4650
02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 2>chronic inflammation over time can lead to a lot of age related diseases and Dha</v>

4651
02:13:43.021 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 2>as we I think even discussed last time,</v>

4652
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:48.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a really important component of your cell membranes,</v>

4653
02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.710
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the brain,</v>

4654
02:13:49.711 --> 02:13:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like 40% of it.</v>

4655
02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:52.820
<v Speaker 2>So I took a lot of,</v>

4656
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:53.843
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot,</v>

4657
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I speak a lot to how much she took a day.</v>

4658
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So well it depends.</v>

4659
02:13:56.701 --> 02:13:57.534
<v Speaker 2>So you have to look,</v>

4660
02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:58.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4661
02:13:58.110 --> 02:14:02.940
<v Speaker 2>you got your fish oil container and on the front it says like 1000 milligrams or</v>

4662
02:14:02.941 --> 02:14:05.160
<v Speaker 2>of mine says 2,120 or something.</v>

4663
02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:08.220
<v Speaker 2>And then you turn around in the back and you look at the break,</v>

4664
02:14:08.250 --> 02:14:09.083
<v Speaker 2>the breakdown.</v>

4665
02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4666
02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.291
<v Speaker 2>how much EPA,</v>

4667
02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:11.090
<v Speaker 2>how much DPA,</v>

4668
02:14:11.090 --> 02:14:11.731
<v Speaker 2>a Dha.</v>

4669
02:14:11.731 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other fish oils mixed.</v>

4670
02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:18.770
<v Speaker 2>So on my container it says like 200 or 2,100 and something.</v>

4671
02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:19.890
<v Speaker 2>And I turned on the back,</v>

4672
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:24.000
<v Speaker 2>it's got 800 milligrams of EPA and 600 milligrams of Dha.</v>

4673
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:24.931
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

4674
02:14:24.931 --> 02:14:26.100
<v Speaker 2>and then all the rest is just fish oil,</v>

4675
02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:27.060
<v Speaker 2>fish oil stuff.</v>

4676
02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:31.830
<v Speaker 2>So I actually calculate how much I take based on those components,</v>

4677
02:14:31.831 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 2>the EPA and Dha because that's important.</v>

4678
02:14:33.930 --> 02:14:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That's what's important to me.</v>

4679
02:14:35.850 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 2>So I take about six pills of those a day and a serving size,</v>

4680
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:41.190
<v Speaker 2>I guess a serving size is two.</v>

4681
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:44.730
<v Speaker 2>So a little bit more than that.</v>

4682
02:14:44.731 --> 02:14:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I took 10 10 pills.</v>

4683
02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4684
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:48.780
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>

4685
02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:49.411
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>

4686
02:14:49.411 --> 02:14:49.891
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>

4687
02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've done that in the past.</v>

4688
02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:58.090
<v Speaker 2>It has a big impact on joint health has a big impact for uh,</v>

4689
02:14:58.650 --> 02:14:59.580
<v Speaker 2>for grapplers,</v>

4690
02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:00.270
<v Speaker 2>for Jujitsu,</v>

4691
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:05.270
<v Speaker 2>people are always getting sore knees and elbows is a big issue and even sore</v>

4692
02:15:05.911 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 2>backs and it has a huge impact on that.</v>

4693
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 2>The antiinflammatories absolutely,</v>

4694
02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:11.280
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

4695
02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:12.690
<v Speaker 2>What is the anti inflammatory,</v>

4696
02:15:12.691 --> 02:15:13.950
<v Speaker 2>what does the actual mechanism,</v>

4697
02:15:13.951 --> 02:15:16.350
<v Speaker 2>the anti inflammatory mechanism involved in fish oil?</v>

4698
02:15:16.351 --> 02:15:17.460
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

4699
02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 2>the EPA is the major part.</v>

4700
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:22.050
<v Speaker 2>So you can actually by EPA,</v>

4701
02:15:22.051 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 2>like just,</v>

4702
02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:23.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4703
02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:23.761
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4704
02:15:23.761 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 2>there's companies that will sell.</v>

4705
02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're really just looking at the anti inflammatory part of the fish oil,</v>

4706
02:15:28.261 --> 02:15:29.280
<v Speaker 2>you can buy EPA.</v>

4707
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:30.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more expensive.</v>

4708
02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.700
<v Speaker 2>But what it does is it inhibits that whole [inaudible] acid pathway,</v>

4709
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:38.250
<v Speaker 2>which produces prostoglandins.</v>

4710
02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:39.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

4711
02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like upstream where it's,</v>

4712
02:15:40.691 --> 02:15:44.220
<v Speaker 2>it's inhibiting the production of [inaudible] acid and then prostoglandins which</v>

4713
02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.231
<v Speaker 2>activate Cox.</v>

4714
02:15:45.231 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 2>It like,</v>

4715
02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:45.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4716
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:45.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4717
02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:49.230
<v Speaker 2>you've got this whole cascade of inflammation going on.</v>

4718
02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:50.370
<v Speaker 2>It plays a major role,</v>

4719
02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:50.970
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

4720
02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 2>and there's probably other mechanisms I haven't even read about,</v>

4721
02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:55.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4722
02:15:55.140 --> 02:15:56.460
<v Speaker 2>other things going on as well.</v>

4723
02:15:56.630 --> 02:15:57.463
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4724
02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:57.901
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

4725
02:15:57.901 --> 02:15:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure,</v>

4726
02:15:58.980 --> 02:15:59.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4727
02:15:59.191 --> 02:16:00.080
<v Speaker 2>feedback mechanisms,</v>

4728
02:16:00.090 --> 02:16:00.923
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

4729
02:16:01.170 --> 02:16:03.480
<v Speaker 2>But that's the major way that EPA does.</v>

4730
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:08.600
<v Speaker 2>And they've been shown that like taking two grams of EPA a day can lower it can</v>

4731
02:16:09.091 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 2>like reduce your c reactive protein levels.</v>

4732
02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:12.571
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>

4733
02:16:12.571 --> 02:16:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact amount by how much it was,</v>

4734
02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:17.310
<v Speaker 2>but it was pretty significant where it's like,</v>

4735
02:16:17.311 --> 02:16:17.941
<v Speaker 2>it really,</v>

4736
02:16:17.941 --> 02:16:18.541
<v Speaker 2>you can measure,</v>

4737
02:16:18.541 --> 02:16:20.100
<v Speaker 2>it lowers inflammation system,</v>

4738
02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 2>like systemic inflammation.</v>

4739
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.490
<v Speaker 2>How many thousand milligrams or a gram,</v>

4740
02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you just said it.</v>

4741
02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:27.270
<v Speaker 2>1000 milligrams are in one gram,</v>

4742
02:16:27.271 --> 02:16:28.760
<v Speaker 2>2000 milligrams.</v>

4743
02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:29.613
<v Speaker 2>Two grams.</v>

4744
02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4745
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they just call a gram?</v>

4746
02:16:31.590 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4747
02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:33.140
<v Speaker 2>they have to call it no room.</v>

4748
02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:35.090
<v Speaker 2>I usually can get to a thousand.</v>

4749
02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:36.761
<v Speaker 2>It's much easier.</v>

4750
02:16:36.761 --> 02:16:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4751
02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:38.100
<v Speaker 2>it's quite confusing to me.</v>

4752
02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because people aren't aware of the whole metric system and stuff.</v>

4753
02:16:43.690 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 2>So if they see two grams,</v>

4754
02:16:45.431 --> 02:16:45.671
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4755
02:16:45.671 --> 02:16:45.801
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4756
02:16:45.801 --> 02:16:46.634
<v Speaker 2>well that's nothing.</v>

4757
02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:47.913
<v Speaker 2>That's just too,</v>

4758
02:16:47.970 --> 02:16:48.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4759
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.420
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

4760
02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:52.150
<v Speaker 2>people get confused because we go ounces all the time with so many different</v>

4761
02:16:52.151 --> 02:16:52.984
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

4762
02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Why we,</v>

4763
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why we use the metric system in some cases.</v>

4764
02:16:57.131 --> 02:17:00.220
<v Speaker 2>In some cases we don't at all leaders.</v>

4765
02:17:00.250 --> 02:17:00.401
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4766
02:17:00.401 --> 02:17:01.001
<v Speaker 2>it's a leader.</v>

4767
02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Well how many courses in their own fuck?</v>

4768
02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:03.873
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4769
02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:06.460
<v Speaker 2>He could look Pfizer court in the leader.</v>

4770
02:17:06.461 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing to me here?</v>

4771
02:17:07.890 --> 02:17:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4772
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 2>in the lab we do everything.</v>

4773
02:17:09.101 --> 02:17:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Milliliter liter.</v>

4774
02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:10.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4775
02:17:10.371 --> 02:17:11.230
<v Speaker 2>so gallons.</v>

4776
02:17:11.231 --> 02:17:12.220
<v Speaker 2>When you go to the gas station,</v>

4777
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't even see that.</v>

4778
02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I always have to Google.</v>

4779
02:17:15.281 --> 02:17:17.530
<v Speaker 2>How many inches will try to fucking,</v>

4780
02:17:17.531 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm night 90 centimeters.</v>

4781
02:17:19.001 --> 02:17:21.400
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is 96 how tall is that?</v>

4782
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

4783
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:23.801
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4784
02:17:23.801 --> 02:17:26.560
<v Speaker 2>If someone tried to get someone's height in centimeters.</v>

4785
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.870
<v Speaker 2>So is your fish oil that you take,</v>

4786
02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:31.240
<v Speaker 2>is it both EPA and Dha?</v>

4787
02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

4788
02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I take this Carlson's Carlson,</v>

4789
02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:38.620
<v Speaker 2>do you take the lemon flavored one in the bottle or do you take them in pills?</v>

4790
02:17:38.710 --> 02:17:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I take both.</v>

4791
02:17:39.430 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I bring the pills with me.</v>

4792
02:17:40.511 --> 02:17:41.291
<v Speaker 2>When I go on the road,</v>

4793
02:17:41.291 --> 02:17:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I took the lemon and the bottle at home.</v>

4794
02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4795
02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:43.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4796
02:17:43.721 --> 02:17:43.990
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>

4797
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:47.920
<v Speaker 2>there is something to be aware of with the omega three fatty acids and that's</v>

4798
02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:50.050
<v Speaker 2>because they're poly unsaturated fatty acids.</v>

4799
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:51.880
<v Speaker 2>They're very prone to oxidation.</v>

4800
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:53.980
<v Speaker 2>So keeping them at four degree,</v>

4801
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:55.090
<v Speaker 2>well keeping them in the fridge,</v>

4802
02:17:55.091 --> 02:17:55.924
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

4803
02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:57.813
<v Speaker 2>lowers that,</v>

4804
02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:01.000
<v Speaker 2>that oxidation process and also just smelling it,</v>

4805
02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:01.960
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

4806
02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.380
<v Speaker 2>take a sniff of it and make sure it's not rancid smelling when you're taking,</v>

4807
02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking it because that's the one thing.</v>

4808
02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4809
02:18:08.530 --> 02:18:10.000
<v Speaker 2>with the omega three fatty acids.</v>

4810
02:18:10.001 --> 02:18:10.510
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

4811
02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot of omega three fatty acids and I think they're really important.</v>

4812
02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:16.690
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's important to be aware that they can go rancid and,</v>

4813
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:18.130
<v Speaker 2>and if it go ranted,</v>

4814
02:18:18.131 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 2>consuming them can be not as good.</v>

4815
02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And when you leave them in the frigerator,</v>

4816
02:18:23.231 --> 02:18:25.450
<v Speaker 2>how long is it good for when you crack open that bottle?</v>

4817
02:18:25.451 --> 02:18:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I've always given it a two week window.</v>

4818
02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:29.410
<v Speaker 2>If I don't drink it in two weeks,</v>

4819
02:18:29.411 --> 02:18:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I throw it out is that I don't use the bottle,</v>

4820
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4821
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.131
<v Speaker 2>any more.</v>

4822
02:18:33.131 --> 02:18:37.000
<v Speaker 2>But the bottle is more pro is more open to be oxygen.</v>

4823
02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:38.680
<v Speaker 2>So that is one thing to be aware of with,</v>

4824
02:18:38.770 --> 02:18:39.371
<v Speaker 2>with the bottle.</v>

4825
02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:40.450
<v Speaker 2>And that was what the pills,</v>

4826
02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:43.720
<v Speaker 2>that was something that I think that was part of the reason why I switched to</v>

4827
02:18:43.721 --> 02:18:43.871
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4828
02:18:43.871 --> 02:18:47.140
<v Speaker 2>That and I think I got really sick of that lemon flavor.</v>

4829
02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:47.951
<v Speaker 2>It gets kind of fun.</v>

4830
02:18:47.951 --> 02:18:48.784
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of much,</v>

4831
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:49.091
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4832
02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:52.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's easier to just not taste anything and you swallow the pills,</v>

4833
02:18:52.691 --> 02:18:54.520
<v Speaker 2>but then you're dealing with the gelatin as well.</v>

4834
02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.410
<v Speaker 2>It's still too spot.</v>

4835
02:18:56.710 --> 02:19:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I haven't convinced myself that it's doing my charm,</v>

4836
02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:00.701
<v Speaker 2>but who knows.</v>

4837
02:19:00.701 --> 02:19:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I,</v>

4838
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:02.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe I haven't dug deep enough.</v>

4839
02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:03.160
<v Speaker 2>What about Krill oil?</v>

4840
02:19:03.161 --> 02:19:04.420
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about crude oil?</v>

4841
02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4842
02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:06.670
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really done much,</v>

4843
02:19:06.671 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 2>much reading on the Krill is that,</v>

4844
02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 2>that has vitamin A as well or that's caught.</v>

4845
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking I'm conflating cod.</v>

4846
02:19:13.630 --> 02:19:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Cod liver oil was the one that they always gave us when we're kids.</v>

4847
02:19:16.131 --> 02:19:16.964
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>

4848
02:19:17.490 --> 02:19:19.240
<v Speaker 2>get that away from tried it.</v>

4849
02:19:19.241 --> 02:19:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Like the taste.</v>

4850
02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I think I've had a pill and I couldn't really tell.</v>

4851
02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I actually think I have crude oil here.</v>

4852
02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

4853
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4854
02:19:24.430 --> 02:19:25.263
<v Speaker 2>Let me hold.</v>

4855
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:28.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4856
02:19:28.641 --> 02:19:28.930
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

4857
02:19:28.930 --> 02:19:29.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4858
02:19:29.271 --> 02:19:29.900
<v Speaker 4>taking,</v>

4859
02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:32.900
<v Speaker 4>taking the Omega three and just popping it open every once in a while and</v>

4860
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:35.000
<v Speaker 4>smelling it is a good idea.</v>

4861
02:19:35.001 --> 02:19:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I recommend doing that because you can smell what rancid fats smells like.</v>

4862
02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:39.960
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I like to do.</v>

4863
02:19:39.961 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 4>And every once in a while I'll just grab my Omega three pill out of the fridge</v>

4864
02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:44.960
<v Speaker 4>and take some scissors,</v>

4865
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:46.130
<v Speaker 4>cut it open and smell it.</v>

4866
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 4>And a,</v>

4867
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.510
<v Speaker 4>if it doesn't smell rancid,</v>

4868
02:19:47.511 --> 02:19:48.230
<v Speaker 4>that's still good.</v>

4869
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4870
02:19:48.411 --> 02:19:51.410
<v Speaker 5>I've got some krill telling him about that</v>

4871
02:19:53.350 --> 02:19:54.183
<v Speaker 3>is um,</v>

4872
02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 5>well krill oil,</v>

4873
02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:00.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's supposed to be the benefit of Krill oil over here.</v>

4874
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Fish oils have a lot of Dha or EPA on it.</v>

4875
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:06.103
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4876
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:11.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean it says 75 milligrams of Dha and 130 milligrams of EPA and that's too</v>

4877
02:20:12.801 --> 02:20:13.820
<v Speaker 4>soft gel servings.</v>

4878
02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:17.660
<v Speaker 5>So you think that fish oil is probably a better choice.</v>

4879
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Thanks oil.</v>

4880
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4881
02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:20.643
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4882
02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:21.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's,</v>

4883
02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:23.500
<v Speaker 4>there's also one gram of Krill oil,</v>

4884
02:20:23.501 --> 02:20:24.970
<v Speaker 4>so it says one gram of Krill oil.</v>

4885
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's something in there I'm not aware of because I really,</v>

4886
02:20:27.671 --> 02:20:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I just haven't done a lot of research on,</v>

4887
02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:32.320
<v Speaker 4>but I'm looking at the Dha and EPA specifically.</v>

4888
02:20:32.321 --> 02:20:35.590
<v Speaker 4>If you're taking this to get Dha and EPA,</v>

4889
02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:39.640
<v Speaker 4>I would say this is not a very high amount.</v>

4890
02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:44.000
<v Speaker 5>So you think that if there is something good about Krill oil,</v>

4891
02:20:44.210 --> 02:20:45.830
<v Speaker 5>you should probably,</v>

4892
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.540
<v Speaker 5>what lessons?</v>

4893
02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Why is it this thing's Krill oil radically better than fish oil.</v>

4894
02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:51.813
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4895
02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:53.770
<v Speaker 5>Blood sugar regulator.</v>

4896
02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:55.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about it,</v>

4897
02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:55.781
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately.</v>

4898
02:20:55.781 --> 02:20:57.180
<v Speaker 5>There's some other reasons.</v>

4899
02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's something else.</v>

4900
02:20:58.351 --> 02:20:58.561
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4901
02:20:58.561 --> 02:20:59.221
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

4902
02:20:59.221 --> 02:20:59.541
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4903
02:20:59.541 --> 02:21:00.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm completely ignorant on</v>

4904
02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:01.521
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

4905
02:21:01.521 --> 02:21:02.091
<v Speaker 5>On this website.</v>

4906
02:21:02.091 --> 02:21:06.740
<v Speaker 5>Krill oil actually influences your metabolism and a jeans to improve.</v>

4907
02:21:06.741 --> 02:21:11.150
<v Speaker 5>The reference study found that although both fish oil and Krill oil contain</v>

4908
02:21:11.151 --> 02:21:12.110
<v Speaker 5>Omega threes,</v>

4909
02:21:12.111 --> 02:21:15.200
<v Speaker 5>they differ greatly in how they affected genes.</v>

4910
02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:16.640
<v Speaker 5>Controlling your metabolism,</v>

4911
02:21:16.641 --> 02:21:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Krill oil enhances glucose metabolism in your liver,</v>

4912
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:21.080
<v Speaker 5>whereas fish oil does not.</v>

4913
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:25.550
<v Speaker 5>A krill oil promotes lipid metabolism or as fish oil does.</v>

4914
02:21:25.551 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

4915
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.480
<v Speaker 5>Krill oil helps regulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain,</v>

4916
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:30.500
<v Speaker 5>whereas fish oil does.</v>

4917
02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.790
<v Speaker 4>So Dha does do those things.</v>

4918
02:21:32.791 --> 02:21:34.080
<v Speaker 4>So when they're saying fish oil,</v>

4919
02:21:34.930 --> 02:21:35.491
<v Speaker 4>what are they talking?</v>

4920
02:21:35.491 --> 02:21:36.300
<v Speaker 4>They're talking shit.</v>

4921
02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:36.601
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4922
02:21:36.601 --> 02:21:37.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

4923
02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:38.063
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

4924
02:21:38.850 --> 02:21:40.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I'm following.</v>

4925
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:45.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not either because Dha does regulate lipid lipid metabolism and also,</v>

4926
02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:47.810
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>

4927
02:21:47.810 --> 02:21:51.510
<v Speaker 4>so Dha and EPA in addition to to,</v>

4928
02:21:51.511 --> 02:21:52.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4929
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.470
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4930
02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:55.130
<v Speaker 4>the anti inflammatory effects of EPA and in addition to the,</v>

4931
02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:55.801
<v Speaker 4>the lip,</v>

4932
02:21:55.801 --> 02:21:57.060
<v Speaker 4>a lipid membrane,</v>

4933
02:21:57.061 --> 02:21:57.894
<v Speaker 4>part of the Dha,</v>

4934
02:21:58.170 --> 02:22:02.400
<v Speaker 4>these fatty acid molecules are signaling molecules that actually bind to</v>

4935
02:22:02.401 --> 02:22:02.920
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

4936
02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:03.753
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4937
02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:07.770
<v Speaker 4>DNA regions in your gene and activate them.</v>

4938
02:22:08.350 --> 02:22:09.600
<v Speaker 4>A much like vitamin D does.</v>

4939
02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:12.090
<v Speaker 4>And Dha and EPA do this.</v>

4940
02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:13.900
<v Speaker 4>So Dha can,</v>

4941
02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:15.000
<v Speaker 4>can activate genes.</v>

4942
02:22:15.001 --> 02:22:15.834
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

4943
02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:16.861
<v Speaker 4>if they're talking about,</v>

4944
02:22:16.861 --> 02:22:19.740
<v Speaker 4>and they've been shown to activate mitochondrial metabolism genes.</v>

4945
02:22:20.010 --> 02:22:23.280
<v Speaker 4>So when they say Krill oil and fish oil does not,</v>

4946
02:22:23.281 --> 02:22:23.670
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

4947
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:24.840
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

4948
02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:25.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to be specific.</v>

4949
02:22:25.921 --> 02:22:26.671
<v Speaker 4>What is it you're talking,</v>

4950
02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:28.440
<v Speaker 4>are you talking about Dha because they're in,</v>

4951
02:22:28.441 --> 02:22:30.780
<v Speaker 4>but you know what else is there?</v>

4952
02:22:30.970 --> 02:22:31.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4953
02:22:31.241 --> 02:22:32.620
<v Speaker 1>This is an article from Mercola.</v>

4954
02:22:33.070 --> 02:22:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good website?</v>

4955
02:22:34.930 --> 02:22:35.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4956
02:22:35.530 --> 02:22:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Mercola is a hit or miss.</v>

4957
02:22:38.261 --> 02:22:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I think he does have a lot of good.</v>

4958
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:41.560
<v Speaker 4>Every once in a while there's something,</v>

4959
02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:42.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4960
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:43.870
<v Speaker 4>it's both.</v>

4961
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I haven't spend a lot of time reading his stuff.</v>

4962
02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:48.573
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4963
02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.440
<v Speaker 4>but I do think he does.</v>

4964
02:22:50.441 --> 02:22:51.940
<v Speaker 4>He does have some good information,</v>

4965
02:22:52.390 --> 02:22:53.223
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

4966
02:22:53.470 --> 02:22:55.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound like Krill oils bath.</v>

4967
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:59.470
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem like fish oil is probably more beneficial or pro.</v>

4968
02:22:59.770 --> 02:22:59.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4969
02:22:59.921 --> 02:23:00.754
<v Speaker 1>there's other things in here.</v>

4970
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:01.603
<v Speaker 4>What's in it?</v>

4971
02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4972
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.460
<v Speaker 4>so the point is you have to be specific.</v>

4973
02:23:04.461 --> 02:23:05.780
<v Speaker 4>If you're saying just krill oil,</v>

4974
02:23:05.781 --> 02:23:06.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4975
02:23:06.350 --> 02:23:09.920
<v Speaker 4>you talking about other things in the Krill oil because if we're talking about</v>

4976
02:23:09.921 --> 02:23:11.990
<v Speaker 4>gene activation to DPA and Dha,</v>

4977
02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:13.280
<v Speaker 4>Dha is doing that.</v>

4978
02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.100
<v Speaker 4>Dee Dee Dha is activating genes.</v>

4979
02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:16.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4980
02:23:16.581 --> 02:23:16.850
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4981
02:23:16.850 --> 02:23:17.150
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

4982
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:20.200
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's doing in addition to what it's doing for your [inaudible].</v>

4983
02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:20.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4984
02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.830
<v Speaker 1>This is so confusing after reading what you said,</v>

4985
02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:24.990
<v Speaker 1>because it's saying some studies have shown the Krill oil,</v>

4986
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Krill oil may be 48 times more potent than fish oil.</v>

4987
02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It means you will need far less of it than fish oil is confirmed by a 2011 study</v>

4988
02:23:33.151 --> 02:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

4989
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:34.740
<v Speaker 1>48 times more potent.</v>

4990
02:23:34.741 --> 02:23:35.574
<v Speaker 1>In what sense?</v>

4991
02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:36.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4992
02:23:36.250 --> 02:23:38.140
<v Speaker 4>What are we talking about in the Krill oil?</v>

4993
02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand.</v>

4994
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:42.100
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

4995
02:23:42.101 --> 02:23:43.600
<v Speaker 4>And people have mortgages,</v>

4996
02:23:43.601 --> 02:23:44.770
<v Speaker 4>they have jobs,</v>

4997
02:23:44.771 --> 02:23:45.670
<v Speaker 4>they have children,</v>

4998
02:23:45.671 --> 02:23:46.870
<v Speaker 4>they have dogs to feed,</v>

4999
02:23:46.871 --> 02:23:48.070
<v Speaker 4>they have a plant water.</v>

5000
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:50.530
<v Speaker 4>They don't fuck and time to get into all this stuff.</v>

5001
02:23:51.790 --> 02:23:52.181
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5002
02:23:52.181 --> 02:23:52.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5003
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:53.710
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad for people.</v>

5004
02:23:53.711 --> 02:23:55.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's hard enough for me.</v>

5005
02:23:55.091 --> 02:23:56.770
<v Speaker 4>You're a person who is talking about,</v>

5006
02:23:56.890 --> 02:23:57.291
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5007
02:23:57.291 --> 02:23:57.491
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

5008
02:23:57.491 --> 02:23:59.440
<v Speaker 4>it's cause it's craziness.</v>

5009
02:23:59.470 --> 02:24:00.370
<v Speaker 4>It's craziness.</v>

5010
02:24:00.371 --> 02:24:02.800
<v Speaker 4>And the reality is understanding mechanism.</v>

5011
02:24:02.801 --> 02:24:03.401
<v Speaker 4>Like what I'm saying,</v>

5012
02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:06.340
<v Speaker 4>mechanism I'm talking about Dha can activate,</v>

5013
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:07.203
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5014
02:24:07.390 --> 02:24:09.140
<v Speaker 4>promoters and certain genes to,</v>

5015
02:24:09.141 --> 02:24:12.610
<v Speaker 4>to increase the expression of mitochondrial metabolism genes that's been shown.</v>

5016
02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:13.930
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

5017
02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:16.050
<v Speaker 4>so when you say Krill oil is better,</v>

5018
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.930
<v Speaker 4>can do that in fish oil.</v>

5019
02:24:16.931 --> 02:24:17.201
<v Speaker 4>Can't,</v>

5020
02:24:17.201 --> 02:24:18.310
<v Speaker 4>that makes no sense to me.</v>

5021
02:24:18.610 --> 02:24:21.940
<v Speaker 4>You need to tell me what specifically is and the Krill oil that's not in fish</v>

5022
02:24:21.941 --> 02:24:23.350
<v Speaker 4>oil out because you know,</v>

5023
02:24:23.351 --> 02:24:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Dha and EPA are in fish oil.</v>

5024
02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5025
02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:28.420
<v Speaker 4>Are we talking about a concentration dependent thing?</v>

5026
02:24:28.421 --> 02:24:28.721
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5027
02:24:28.721 --> 02:24:31.000
<v Speaker 4>is there a more Dha and EPA in Krill oil?</v>

5028
02:24:31.001 --> 02:24:32.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't know actually.</v>

5029
02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:34.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5030
02:24:34.181 --> 02:24:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

5031
02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:35.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5032
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I think this is something that's going to have to be really studied in,</v>

5033
02:24:39.161 --> 02:24:41.020
<v Speaker 1>in length and a,</v>

5034
02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see you,</v>

5035
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5036
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:44.890
<v Speaker 1>dive into all these claims,</v>

5037
02:24:44.891 --> 02:24:48.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's quite a few claims online about the benefits of crow oil over fish</v>

5038
02:24:48.701 --> 02:24:49.510
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

5039
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:50.250
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>

5040
02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it the,</v>

5041
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:52.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that st quote,</v>

5042
02:24:52.061 --> 02:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>cool oil contains asset tax.</v>

5043
02:24:55.260 --> 02:24:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

5044

5068
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5069
02:25:09.071 --> 02:25:09.401
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

5070
02:25:09.401 --> 02:25:09.671
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

5071
02:25:09.671 --> 02:25:10.504
<v Speaker 1>that's a mouthful.</v>

5072
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.983
<v Speaker 1>Tax.</v>

5073
02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:13.310
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5074
02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>a unique marine sourced flavonoid that creates a special bond with the EPA and</v>

5075
02:25:19.031 --> 02:25:19.601
<v Speaker 1>Dha,</v>

5076
02:25:19.601 --> 02:25:22.630
<v Speaker 1>which allows direct metabolism of the antioxidants,</v>

5077
02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.850
<v Speaker 1>make them more bioavailable.</v>

5078
02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:25.713
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

5079
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.123
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5080
02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Does that sound like Malarkey?</v>

5081
02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:31.091
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>

5082
02:25:31.091 --> 02:25:31.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

5083
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5084
02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:34.733
<v Speaker 2>they did that.</v>

5085
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:35.770
<v Speaker 2>It really is the issue,</v>

5086
02:25:35.771 --> 02:25:36.131
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

5087
02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:39.100
<v Speaker 2>There's just so much to try to sift through,</v>

5088
02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:43.810
<v Speaker 2>find out how to separate the wheat from the chaff I was at where it's,</v>

5089
02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:44.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5090
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.071
<v Speaker 2>With,</v>

5091
02:25:45.071 --> 02:25:46.930
<v Speaker 2>with the Dha and EPA,</v>

5092
02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:51.490
<v Speaker 2>some really important thing in my opinion is getting it,</v>

5093
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:52.443
<v Speaker 2>getting it up a bit,</v>

5094
02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:53.051
<v Speaker 2>like getting,</v>

5095
02:25:53.051 --> 02:25:53.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5096
02:25:53.261 --> 02:25:54.094
<v Speaker 2>taking,</v>

5097
02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:55.090
<v Speaker 2>taking the good bed of,</v>

5098
02:25:55.091 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>of Dha and EPA because most people aren't getting any of it and all this other</v>

5099
02:25:58.721 --> 02:25:59.310
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

5100
02:25:59.310 --> 02:26:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5101
02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not sure how significant it is.</v>

5102
02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it does increase bioavailability of a little bit.</v>

5103
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

5104
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it really makes a big difference.</v>

5105
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:11.103
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5106
02:26:11.470 --> 02:26:12.070
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

5107
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:16.240
<v Speaker 2>so for the folks that are taking the gear or they're getting their omega threes</v>

5108
02:26:16.470 --> 02:26:19.570
<v Speaker 2>s just completely from a plant source,</v>

5109
02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.340
<v Speaker 2>what can they do,</v>

5110
02:26:21.341 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 2>if anything to try to,</v>

5111
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I really think the micro algae oil is the best.</v>

5112
02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5113
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

5114
02:26:26.890 --> 02:26:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend taking the fish oil,</v>

5115
02:26:28.871 --> 02:26:30.280
<v Speaker 2>but I guess they won't do that.</v>

5116
02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Some cases vegetarians won't do that.</v>

5117
02:26:32.730 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5118
02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:37.000
<v Speaker 2>so the micro algae oil is the next best thing in my opinion.</v>

5119
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:38.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5120
02:26:39.130 --> 02:26:39.881
<v Speaker 2>and like I said,</v>

5121
02:26:39.881 --> 02:26:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know much about about the Krill oil,</v>

5122
02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:43.810
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that these Dha,</v>

5123
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Dha is very important as is EPA.</v>

5124
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:47.560
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

5125
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:49.270
<v Speaker 2>a variety of different reasons.</v>

5126
02:26:49.570 --> 02:26:49.721
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5127
02:26:49.721 --> 02:26:53.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send you some of these studies on,</v>

5128
02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:54.520
<v Speaker 2>on the Krill oil to see if you,</v>

5129
02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:58.060
<v Speaker 2>unless you get bored reading it and you can't do it.</v>

5130
02:26:58.210 --> 02:26:59.043
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5131
02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:00.041
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

5132
02:27:00.041 --> 02:27:03.040
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it's just such a boy,</v>

5133
02:27:03.041 --> 02:27:03.850
<v Speaker 2>it's such a mess.</v>

5134
02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It's such a,</v>

5135
02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:09.280
<v Speaker 2>there's so many different supplements then just going into all the contradictory</v>

5136
02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:10.031
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>

5137
02:27:10.031 --> 02:27:12.490
<v Speaker 2>the back and forth about all these different ones.</v>

5138
02:27:12.491 --> 02:27:14.080
<v Speaker 2>It can be incredibly taxing.</v>

5139
02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.040
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

5140
02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean your website is a great resource or this,</v>

5141
02:27:17.610 --> 02:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5142
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:18.260
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

5143
02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:22.960
<v Speaker 2>if people want to go to found my fitness.com and try to figure out what,</v>

5144
02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:26.320
<v Speaker 2>what you've already sort of described and your verde explained,</v>

5145
02:27:26.321 --> 02:27:28.030
<v Speaker 2>but how does a person start?</v>

5146
02:27:28.170 --> 02:27:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I think a really good resource that I like is the Linus Pauling Institute.</v>

5147
02:27:34.930 --> 02:27:36.970
<v Speaker 2>So if you got the Linus Pauling Institute,</v>

5148
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.940
<v Speaker 2>they are pretty good about writing a very,</v>

5149
02:27:40.330 --> 02:27:45.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a scientific research institute that's associated with Oregon Health</v>

5150
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:47.890
<v Speaker 2>University or Oregon State and health university isn't like that,</v>

5151
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:48.790
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

5152
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:49.623
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5153
02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:50.441
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

5154
02:27:50.441 --> 02:27:50.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5155
02:27:50.681 --> 02:27:55.490
<v Speaker 2>do a very balanced review on a variety of different supplemental vitamins and</v>

5156
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:58.760
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals and essential fatty acids and uh,</v>

5157
02:27:59.200 --> 02:27:59.491
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

5158
02:27:59.491 --> 02:28:00.970
<v Speaker 2>that they give you both sides.</v>

5159
02:28:00.971 --> 02:28:02.560
<v Speaker 2>And now if they go into the Krill,</v>

5160
02:28:02.561 --> 02:28:04.360
<v Speaker 2>they sometimes they'll go into things like that.</v>

5161
02:28:04.361 --> 02:28:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5162
02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.520
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking,</v>

5163
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I really like Alliance Pauling Institute.</v>

5164
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.110
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

5165
02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a good resource.</v>

5166
02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:16.510
<v Speaker 2>If are there places where someone can go where they can,</v>

5167
02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:16.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5168
02:28:16.811 --> 02:28:18.340
<v Speaker 2>like say like you're just,</v>

5169
02:28:18.341 --> 02:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not sure what you need.</v>

5170
02:28:20.021 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about various</v>

5171
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:25.170
<v Speaker 1>levels of vitamins and getting them tested.</v>

5172
02:28:25.171 --> 02:28:25.281
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

5173
02:28:25.281 --> 02:28:27.570
<v Speaker 1>is there like a standard place where you could go?</v>

5174
02:28:27.571 --> 02:28:27.990
<v Speaker 1>We could,</v>

5175
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5176
02:28:28.311 --> 02:28:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like someone who lives in the middle of nowhere can find a place and get their</v>

5177
02:28:32.781 --> 02:28:33.614
<v Speaker 1>blood tested.</v>

5178
02:28:33.690 --> 02:28:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the companies that I am familiar with,</v>

5179
02:28:36.690 --> 02:28:37.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5180
02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.490
<v Speaker 4>as wellness FX,</v>

5181
02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:43.230
<v Speaker 4>and I have no association with them other than I did a couple of guest blog</v>

5182
02:28:43.231 --> 02:28:48.231
<v Speaker 4>posts for them where I for free wrote about Vitamin D and magnesium and uh,</v>

5183
02:28:48.931 --> 02:28:49.590
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5184
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:50.251
<v Speaker 4>they actually,</v>

5185
02:28:50.251 --> 02:28:54.150
<v Speaker 4>I think they're are pretty much in almost every state now where you can go onto</v>

5186
02:28:54.151 --> 02:28:56.820
<v Speaker 4>their website and they have a variety of different acids.</v>

5187
02:28:56.821 --> 02:28:57.091
<v Speaker 4>They'll do,</v>

5188
02:28:57.091 --> 02:28:57.211
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5189
02:28:57.211 --> 02:29:01.410
<v Speaker 4>they're measured different vitamins and minerals and omega three fatty acids.</v>

5190
02:29:01.411 --> 02:29:02.161
<v Speaker 4>They'll measure different things.</v>

5191
02:29:02.161 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 4>We'll see reactive protein and that,</v>

5192
02:29:04.341 --> 02:29:05.490
<v Speaker 4>and you can go to any,</v>

5193
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:06.503
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5194
02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:10.680
<v Speaker 4>enter your address and go to like a lab corp around nearest by whatever and get</v>

5195
02:29:10.681 --> 02:29:11.514
<v Speaker 4>your blood drawn.</v>

5196
02:29:11.730 --> 02:29:14.640
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll give you the data within a couple of days.</v>

5197
02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:15.660
<v Speaker 4>They'll help you interpret it.</v>

5198
02:29:15.661 --> 02:29:20.640
<v Speaker 4>They have a variety of different positions and nutritional people that can help</v>

5199
02:29:20.641 --> 02:29:22.650
<v Speaker 4>you interpret what your blood results mean.</v>

5200
02:29:22.890 --> 02:29:23.671
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

5201
02:29:23.671 --> 02:29:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I used it myself.</v>

5202
02:29:24.601 --> 02:29:27.900
<v Speaker 4>We also got a test for my mother in law to use and she lives in Mississippi.</v>

5203
02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:29.010
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5204
02:29:29.010 --> 02:29:29.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5205
02:29:29.281 --> 02:29:29.731
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

5206
02:29:29.731 --> 02:29:30.564
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much,</v>

5207
02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I think it's pretty much everywhere now.</v>

5208
02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:34.320
<v Speaker 4>So I really like them.</v>

5209
02:29:34.350 --> 02:29:36.690
<v Speaker 4>And obviously you can go to your physician and your health care,</v>

5210
02:29:36.691 --> 02:29:38.010
<v Speaker 4>your primary health care provider,</v>

5211
02:29:38.011 --> 02:29:38.520
<v Speaker 4>but they might not,</v>

5212
02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:40.890
<v Speaker 4>may not measure everything that you want,</v>

5213
02:29:40.891 --> 02:29:41.724
<v Speaker 4>like a three.</v>

5214
02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:44.870
<v Speaker 1>And they also might give you some of that mall you'll need to do was eat a</v>

5215
02:29:44.871 --> 02:29:45.980
<v Speaker 1>balanced diet.</v>

5216
02:29:46.220 --> 02:29:47.053
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5217
02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.520
<v Speaker 1>How many times have I heard that from a physician?</v>

5218
02:29:49.521 --> 02:29:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It looked like shit,</v>

5219
02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:51.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5220
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:52.910
<v Speaker 1>like overweight position.</v>

5221
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:53.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5222
02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:54.501
<v Speaker 1>sloppy,</v>

5223
02:29:54.501 --> 02:29:55.700
<v Speaker 1>loose skin all around.</v>

5224
02:29:55.701 --> 02:29:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It's free.</v>

5225
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5226
02:29:56.331 --> 02:29:56.511
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

5227
02:29:56.511 --> 02:29:57.230
<v Speaker 1>you're melting,</v>

5228
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5229
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:58.670
<v Speaker 4>Well tell me what to do.</v>

5230
02:29:58.840 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5231
02:29:59.480 --> 02:29:59.751
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5232
02:29:59.751 --> 02:30:00.584
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

5233
02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:03.260
<v Speaker 4>but the wellness effects is pretty cool.</v>

5234
02:30:03.430 --> 02:30:03.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5235
02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I really liked them.</v>

5236
02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.140
<v Speaker 4>But the nutrition thing,</v>

5237
02:30:06.141 --> 02:30:08.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it's making its way into medicine.</v>

5238
02:30:08.331 --> 02:30:10.550
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of the reason why people like Offit,</v>

5239
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:11.470
<v Speaker 4>who is an MD,</v>

5240
02:30:11.810 --> 02:30:12.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5241
02:30:12.021 --> 02:30:12.800
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>

5242
02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:14.580
<v Speaker 4>they've been trained um,</v>

5243
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:15.770
<v Speaker 4>very differently.</v>

5244
02:30:15.771 --> 02:30:18.560
<v Speaker 4>They haven't been trained in understanding preventative medicine,</v>

5245
02:30:18.561 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 4>understanding how these complex micronutrients are interacting with different,</v>

5246
02:30:22.490 --> 02:30:23.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5247
02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:26.270
<v Speaker 4>proteins in our body and how that's important to prevent different diseases.</v>

5248
02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:26.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5249
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:27.210
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5250
02:30:27.210 --> 02:30:28.370
<v Speaker 4>they're have so they're not,</v>

5251
02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:30.710
<v Speaker 4>they're not thinking about it from the same frame of mind.</v>

5252
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:31.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5253
02:30:31.540 --> 02:30:32.300
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

5254
02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:33.133
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5255
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:35.960
<v Speaker 4>as people like me that are phd researchers,</v>

5256
02:30:35.961 --> 02:30:37.760
<v Speaker 4>our nutritionist and there's a variety of other,</v>

5257
02:30:38.050 --> 02:30:38.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5258
02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.160
<v Speaker 4>I guess natural pathic doctors may be,</v>

5259
02:30:40.161 --> 02:30:40.994
<v Speaker 4>have more,</v>

5260
02:30:41.130 --> 02:30:44.240
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole variety of different naturopathic yeah.</v>

5261
02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Gets lumped into homeopathics sometimes accent different.</v>

5262
02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5263
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:48.620
<v Speaker 1>completely different.</v>

5264
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I've been guilty of it myself.</v>

5265
02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5266
02:30:50.930 --> 02:30:51.763
<v Speaker 1>I think I have as well.</v>

5267
02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I confused them in a way where the,</v>

5268
02:30:53.981 --> 02:30:54.814
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

5269
02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:57.260
<v Speaker 1>anything homeopathic I think of is horse shit</v>

5270
02:30:58.400 --> 02:30:59.231
<v Speaker 4>homeopathic,</v>

5271
02:30:59.231 --> 02:31:04.231
<v Speaker 4>like that crazy thing where they like dilute things to like crazy amounts where</v>

5272
02:31:05.061 --> 02:31:05.751
<v Speaker 4>you can't even,</v>

5273
02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:08.240
<v Speaker 4>there's like no act of compound if you,</v>

5274
02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:13.290
<v Speaker 4>if you'd Google it or look at the Wikipedia of what is decently Hormel,</v>

5275
02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:13.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5276
02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:14.150
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

5277
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:15.140
<v Speaker 4>homeopathic.</v>

5278
02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:17.750
<v Speaker 4>They had to have their own measuring system too.</v>

5279
02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:18.231
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5280
02:31:18.231 --> 02:31:23.231
<v Speaker 4>It's like they'll take a compound and they'll dilute it like a million fold and</v>

5281
02:31:24.631 --> 02:31:28.080
<v Speaker 4>it's like to the point where there's like no biological activity and they give</v>

5282
02:31:28.081 --> 02:31:28.914
<v Speaker 4>it to people.</v>

5283
02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's the homeopathy.</v>

5284
02:31:31.561 --> 02:31:33.000
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize that until recently.</v>

5285
02:31:33.130 --> 02:31:33.461
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5286
02:31:33.461 --> 02:31:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Repeatedly diluting a chosen substance in alcohol or distilled water,</v>

5287
02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.680
<v Speaker 5>followed by forceful striking on an elastic body.</v>

5288
02:31:41.710 --> 02:31:45.910
<v Speaker 5>What dilution usually contains a continues well past the point where no</v>

5289
02:31:45.911 --> 02:31:46.520
<v Speaker 5>molecules,</v>

5290
02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:48.010
<v Speaker 5>the original substance remain.</v>

5291
02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

5292
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.590
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>

5293
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:50.423
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell the story.</v>

5294
02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:56.140
<v Speaker 4>So I recently had my wisdom teeth removed and my oral surgeon gave me this case</v>

5295
02:31:58.650 --> 02:32:01.110
<v Speaker 4>of pills that was Arnica.</v>

5296
02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:01.740
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

5297
02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:01.951
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5298
02:32:01.951 --> 02:32:02.784
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>

5299
02:32:03.210 --> 02:32:03.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5300
02:32:03.421 --> 02:32:03.960
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

5301
02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:04.231
<v Speaker 4>well no,</v>

5302
02:32:04.231 --> 02:32:05.490
<v Speaker 4>it was homeopathic,</v>

5303
02:32:05.491 --> 02:32:07.050
<v Speaker 4>which really makes it nonsense.</v>

5304
02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:09.540
<v Speaker 4>There is some anti microbial activity and things like that,</v>

5305
02:32:09.541 --> 02:32:10.374
<v Speaker 4>and Arnica,</v>

5306
02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:12.960
<v Speaker 4>the real Arnica homeopathic going,</v>

5307
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.830
<v Speaker 4>it goes to like sugar.</v>

5308
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 4>It's water,</v>

5309
02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:16.230
<v Speaker 4>it's water.</v>

5310
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.771
<v Speaker 4>Literally like,</v>

5311
02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:18.690
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know his homeopathic at first.</v>

5312
02:32:18.691 --> 02:32:19.081
<v Speaker 4>I just thought,</v>

5313
02:32:19.081 --> 02:32:19.441
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

5314
02:32:19.441 --> 02:32:20.221
<v Speaker 4>it's just Arnica.</v>

5315
02:32:20.221 --> 02:32:20.790
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5316
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:23.730
<v Speaker 4>and it wasn't until like my husband looked at it and he's like,</v>

5317
02:32:23.731 --> 02:32:25.440
<v Speaker 4>do you realize this is homeopathic?</v>

5318
02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

5319
02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:27.031
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

5320
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:27.730
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really,</v>

5321
02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I knew homeopathic was kind of crazy and I looked,</v>

5322
02:32:29.541 --> 02:32:32.070
<v Speaker 4>we looked it up and it was like mind blowing.</v>

5323
02:32:32.071 --> 02:32:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe that they were giving,</v>

5324
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:35.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think he knows.</v>

5325
02:32:35.701 --> 02:32:38.790
<v Speaker 4>I think he probably made the same mistake I did where I just thought it was just</v>

5326
02:32:38.791 --> 02:32:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Arnica.</v>

5327
02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:41.490
<v Speaker 5>This is for anybody defending homeopathy,</v>

5328
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:42.420
<v Speaker 5>homeopathy,</v>

5329
02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:43.530
<v Speaker 5>this is on Wikipedia.</v>

5330
02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:44.040
<v Speaker 5>Lax,</v>

5331
02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.360
<v Speaker 5>this is all with references,</v>

5332
02:32:45.361 --> 02:32:47.990
<v Speaker 5>lacks biological plausibility and the axioms.</v>

5333
02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:49.230
<v Speaker 5>Homeopathy had been,</v>

5334
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:51.180
<v Speaker 5>had been refuted for some time.</v>

5335
02:32:51.181 --> 02:32:54.720
<v Speaker 5>The postulated mechanisms of action of homeopathic remedies are both</v>

5336
02:32:54.721 --> 02:32:58.230
<v Speaker 5>scientifically implausible and not physically possible,</v>

5337
02:32:58.710 --> 02:33:03.000
<v Speaker 5>although some the clinical trials produce positive results.</v>

5338
02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 5>Systematic reviews reveal that this is because of chance flawed research methods</v>

5339
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:09.180
<v Speaker 5>and reporting bias,</v>

5340
02:33:09.450 --> 02:33:09.860
<v Speaker 5>which is</v>

5341
02:33:09.860 --> 02:33:10.640
<v Speaker 4>pretty common.</v>

5342
02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:11.870
<v Speaker 4>So there you have it.</v>

5343
02:33:11.871 --> 02:33:12.541
<v Speaker 4>Homeopathy,</v>

5344
02:33:12.541 --> 02:33:12.831
<v Speaker 4>you really,</v>

5345
02:33:12.831 --> 02:33:13.630
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5346
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:14.041
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5347
02:33:14.041 --> 02:33:15.510
<v Speaker 5>anytime someone says homeopathy,</v>

5348
02:33:15.511 --> 02:33:17.070
<v Speaker 5>they usually are wearing crystal.</v>

5349
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:19.820
<v Speaker 5>They know someone who's a channel or,</v>

5350
02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:20.380
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

5351
02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:21.213
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5352
02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:21.911
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5353
02:33:21.911 --> 02:33:22.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5354
02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:22.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5355
02:33:22.241 --> 02:33:24.970
<v Speaker 4>getting back to my wisdom teeth or it's a kind of a cool topic.</v>

5356
02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5357
02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:29.590
<v Speaker 4>I had to get them removed because they were like impacted and causing problems</v>

5358
02:33:29.591 --> 02:33:30.430
<v Speaker 4>and pain and such.</v>

5359
02:33:30.730 --> 02:33:31.241
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5360
02:33:31.241 --> 02:33:31.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5361
02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:32.770
<v Speaker 4>I did some research.</v>

5362
02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:33.291
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

5363
02:33:33.291 --> 02:33:33.430
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

5364
02:33:33.430 --> 02:33:33.911
<v Speaker 4>if I have a kid,</v>

5365
02:33:33.911 --> 02:33:34.510
<v Speaker 4>my teeth removed,</v>

5366
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:35.980
<v Speaker 4>there gotta be some kind of benefit from it.</v>

5367
02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:40.450
<v Speaker 4>And I found that that our wisdom teeth have something called dental pulp stem</v>

5368
02:33:40.451 --> 02:33:43.120
<v Speaker 4>cells in them and these dental pulp stem cells.</v>

5369
02:33:43.121 --> 02:33:45.280
<v Speaker 4>So this stem cell research is like a whole,</v>

5370
02:33:45.281 --> 02:33:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm really excited about the stem cell research field and where we're going with</v>

5371
02:33:49.121 --> 02:33:49.690
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

5372
02:33:49.690 --> 02:33:50.523
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

5373
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:55.360
<v Speaker 4>are our wisdom teeth have dental pulp stem cells in them that can actually form</v>

5374
02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:56.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5375
02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.150
<v Speaker 4>other tissues in our body,</v>

5376
02:33:58.151 --> 02:33:59.530
<v Speaker 4>like bone cartilage.</v>

5377
02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:01.480
<v Speaker 4>And they even showed recently they've,</v>

5378
02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:05.380
<v Speaker 4>they've taken dental pulp stem cells from people with impacted wisdom teeth,</v>

5379
02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:06.241
<v Speaker 4>taken them out and,</v>

5380
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:09.970
<v Speaker 4>and transplant them into mice that had damaged motor neurons and it was able to</v>

5381
02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.710
<v Speaker 4>differentiate into damage mode,</v>

5382
02:34:11.770 --> 02:34:13.090
<v Speaker 4>like neurons,</v>

5383
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:15.850
<v Speaker 4>neuronal type cells and help replace that.</v>

5384
02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:20.950
<v Speaker 4>So I went and looked online to see if anyone was banking them cause they do cord</v>

5385
02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:23.320
<v Speaker 4>blood banking where you can bank your core blood.</v>

5386
02:34:23.321 --> 02:34:24.154
<v Speaker 4>And indeed,</v>

5387
02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:25.270
<v Speaker 4>there was a company that,</v>

5388
02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:25.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5389
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:28.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a couple of companies that are both associated with cord blood banks as</v>

5390
02:34:28.451 --> 02:34:28.601
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5391
02:34:28.601 --> 02:34:29.070
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

5392
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:31.690
<v Speaker 4>they bank the dental pulp stem cells that you can,</v>

5393
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:33.190
<v Speaker 4>when you have your teeth removed,</v>

5394
02:34:33.490 --> 02:34:36.310
<v Speaker 4>they send you a kit with likes buffered saline solution.</v>

5395
02:34:36.311 --> 02:34:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Your oral surgeon will stick the teeth in them and then they ship it off back to</v>

5396
02:34:39.431 --> 02:34:42.130
<v Speaker 4>the company and they preserve it in liquid nitrogen.</v>

5397
02:34:42.390 --> 02:34:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5398
02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:44.410
<v Speaker 4>they kind of do very minimal processing.</v>

5399
02:34:44.411 --> 02:34:46.870
<v Speaker 4>They don't actually remove the stem cells that keep it in the tissue,</v>

5400
02:34:46.930 --> 02:34:47.770
<v Speaker 4>the dental pulp tissue,</v>

5401
02:34:47.771 --> 02:34:52.771
<v Speaker 4>and they freeze it in liquid nitrogen so that you can later use it if you need</v>

5402
02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:53.730
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

5403
02:34:53.730 --> 02:34:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5404
02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:58.420
<v Speaker 4>so it's actually really cool because you can use this if you have damaged</v>

5405
02:34:58.421 --> 02:34:59.410
<v Speaker 4>cartilage bone,</v>

5406
02:34:59.411 --> 02:35:03.730
<v Speaker 4>possibly Parkinson's disease where you need to replace damaged motor neurons.</v>

5407
02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:05.013
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5408
02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:07.260
<v Speaker 4>so I thought that was pretty,</v>

5409
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:07.931
<v Speaker 4>pretty cool.</v>

5410
02:35:07.931 --> 02:35:11.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like a benefit for it because getting your wisdom teeth removed is not fun</v>

5411
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.450
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

5412
02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:12.670
<v Speaker 4>It is fascinating though,</v>

5413
02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:14.950
<v Speaker 4>t primary teeth from children also.</v>

5414
02:35:14.951 --> 02:35:16.540
<v Speaker 4>So in the children's teeth,</v>

5415
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5416
02:35:16.811 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 4>they're losing their primary teeth and you just throw the teeth away.</v>

5417
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5418
02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:21.160
<v Speaker 4>they are really,</v>

5419
02:35:21.161 --> 02:35:23.500
<v Speaker 4>they have a really rich source of dental pulp stem cells.</v>

5420
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:24.611
<v Speaker 4>So you can,</v>

5421
02:35:24.611 --> 02:35:24.810
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5422
02:35:24.810 --> 02:35:25.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5423
02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:28.060
<v Speaker 4>your child is their tooth and you can bank it,</v>

5424
02:35:28.490 --> 02:35:28.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5425
02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:30.070
<v Speaker 4>where you freeze it.</v>

5426
02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like $625 for the whole processing and then to store it,</v>

5427
02:35:34.601 --> 02:35:36.130
<v Speaker 4>it's like $125 a year.</v>

5428
02:35:36.310 --> 02:35:40.510
<v Speaker 4>I personally think it's a great investment if you have kids and they,</v>

5429
02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:40.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5430
02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:41.770
<v Speaker 4>losing their teeth are also,</v>

5431
02:35:41.771 --> 02:35:42.480
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

5432
02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:42.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5433
02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:44.680
<v Speaker 4>if you have your wisdom teeth and you have to get them removed,</v>

5434
02:35:45.430 --> 02:35:45.910
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

5435
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:47.880
<v Speaker 4>My daughter is about to lose her first tooth.</v>

5436
02:35:48.730 --> 02:35:49.121
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

5437
02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:49.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5438
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:50.080
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

5439
02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:51.820
<v Speaker 4>the company that I went went with,</v>

5440
02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:52.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5441
02:35:52.270 --> 02:35:52.690
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

5442
02:35:52.690 --> 02:35:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I can give it to you.</v>

5443
02:35:53.450 --> 02:35:55.540
<v Speaker 4>I actually talked to their cell biologists.</v>

5444
02:35:55.541 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 4>I was on the phone cause I read through all the procedures in these scientific</v>

5445
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:02.560
<v Speaker 4>papers to see exactly how you process it in the optimal way and the best way to</v>

5446
02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 4>have the best viability after you thought them.</v>

5447
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:06.880
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like getting on the phone.</v>

5448
02:36:06.881 --> 02:36:07.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

5449
02:36:07.061 --> 02:36:07.271
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5450
02:36:07.271 --> 02:36:07.811
<v Speaker 4>do you do this,</v>

5451
02:36:07.811 --> 02:36:08.231
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>

5452
02:36:08.231 --> 02:36:10.620
<v Speaker 4>And so I went with this company because I spoke with uh,</v>

5453
02:36:10.690 --> 02:36:13.690
<v Speaker 4>one of their cell biologist and they had done the things that I thought were the</v>

5454
02:36:13.691 --> 02:36:14.200
<v Speaker 4>best.</v>

5455
02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:15.033
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5456
02:36:15.250 --> 02:36:16.150
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>

5457
02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:17.253
<v Speaker 4>that whole stem cell phone,</v>

5458
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:17.741
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

5459
02:36:17.741 --> 02:36:17.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5460
02:36:17.961 --> 02:36:18.241
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5461
02:36:18.241 --> 02:36:18.880
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5462
02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:19.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5463
02:36:19.181 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 4>what's really cool is that they can take fiberblast cells from your skin,</v>

5464
02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:26.590
<v Speaker 4>like skin cells that we slopped off like every day.</v>

5465
02:36:27.130 --> 02:36:30.820
<v Speaker 4>And they can add four different transcription factors,</v>

5466
02:36:30.850 --> 02:36:35.850
<v Speaker 4>like four different genes that they can add by like a viral ad virus to them.</v>

5467
02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:41.430
<v Speaker 4>And they can reprogram them to become these pluripotent stem cells in your body.</v>

5468
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:45.040
<v Speaker 4>Meaning they can form any type of cell in your body.</v>

5469
02:36:45.041 --> 02:36:47.260
<v Speaker 4>So you can take a skin cell and you can make it,</v>

5470
02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:47.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5471
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:49.030
<v Speaker 4>into a brain cell,</v>

5472
02:36:49.031 --> 02:36:50.080
<v Speaker 4>a liver cell hearts out.</v>

5473
02:36:50.081 --> 02:36:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean this has huge,</v>

5474
02:36:51.671 --> 02:36:54.820
<v Speaker 4>huge implications for regenerative medicine.</v>

5475
02:36:54.821 --> 02:36:58.030
<v Speaker 4>But I think also just for extending lifespan,</v>

5476
02:36:58.350 --> 02:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>what did you think about this latest study where they took mice and did you read</v>

5477
02:37:02.731 --> 02:37:03.181
<v Speaker 1>about this?</v>

5478
02:37:03.181 --> 02:37:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Where they took young,</v>

5479
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5480
02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:08.280
<v Speaker 1>the blood of young mice and they reintroduced it to old mice.</v>

5481
02:37:08.490 --> 02:37:08.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5482
02:37:08.851 --> 02:37:09.211
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

5483
02:37:09.211 --> 02:37:09.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5484
02:37:09.810 --> 02:37:10.590
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

5485
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:12.000
<v Speaker 4>was that a recent study or was that,</v>

5486
02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5487
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.451
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

5488
02:37:13.451 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it was the recent findings because I've</v>

5489
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.260
<v Speaker 4>seen other studies that were not super recent,</v>

5490
02:37:18.261 --> 02:37:21.680
<v Speaker 4>but what they did was they took like bone marrow cells that had a bone marrow</v>

5491
02:37:21.681 --> 02:37:22.600
<v Speaker 4>transplant and took,</v>

5492
02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:25.760
<v Speaker 4>which obviously bone marrow forms or blood cells from young mice and</v>

5493
02:37:25.761 --> 02:37:27.290
<v Speaker 4>transplanted them to old mice and the,</v>

5494
02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:28.550
<v Speaker 4>and the mouse,</v>

5495
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:30.230
<v Speaker 4>the mice like lived longer.</v>

5496
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:31.051
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5497
02:37:31.051 --> 02:37:31.500
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

5498
02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:32.370
<v Speaker 5>this is recent.</v>

5499
02:37:32.430 --> 02:37:32.731
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5500
02:37:32.731 --> 02:37:33.110
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5501
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.311
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5502
02:37:33.311 --> 02:37:33.510
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

5503
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:35.280
<v Speaker 5>it's from March six or may six,</v>

5504
02:37:35.281 --> 02:37:35.950
<v Speaker 5>rather.</v>

5505
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:39.450
<v Speaker 5>They actually took an injection of young blood,</v>

5506
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:41.430
<v Speaker 5>so they took the blood of,</v>

5507
02:37:42.450 --> 02:37:43.283
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

5508
02:37:43.350 --> 02:37:45.420
<v Speaker 5>they took the blood of a young mice,</v>

5509
02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:50.660
<v Speaker 5>they injected it into old mice and they had a tremendous benefits including</v>

5510
02:37:51.691 --> 02:37:52.590
<v Speaker 5>regenerating,</v>

5511
02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:53.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5512
02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:54.001
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

5513
02:37:54.001 --> 02:37:54.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5514
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:55.710
<v Speaker 5>different cells,</v>

5515
02:37:55.770 --> 02:37:56.491
<v Speaker 5>brain cells,</v>

5516
02:37:56.491 --> 02:37:57.420
<v Speaker 5>tissue cells.</v>

5517
02:37:57.810 --> 02:37:58.021
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5518
02:37:58.021 --> 02:37:58.321
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

5519
02:37:58.321 --> 02:37:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Brain cells as well.</v>

5520
02:37:59.420 --> 02:37:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5521
02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:00.181
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5522
02:38:00.181 --> 02:38:03.540
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense that you'd regenerate different blood populations because you</v>

5523
02:38:03.541 --> 02:38:04.290
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

5524
02:38:04.290 --> 02:38:04.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5525
02:38:04.561 --> 02:38:05.520
<v Speaker 4>stem cells,</v>

5526
02:38:06.390 --> 02:38:08.420
<v Speaker 4>stem cells in the blood and stuff better.</v>

5527
02:38:08.850 --> 02:38:09.460
<v Speaker 4>It improves</v>

5528
02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:13.480
<v Speaker 5>the performance of elderly mice in memory and learning tasks.</v>

5529
02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5530
02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:16.171
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty cool.</v>

5531
02:38:16.171 --> 02:38:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Crazy structural and molecular.</v>

5532
02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Please give me that paper.</v>

5533
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5534
02:38:20.371 --> 02:38:21.204
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

5535
02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:21.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5536
02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:22.434
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

5537
02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:22.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5538
02:38:22.831 --> 02:38:23.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>

5539
02:38:23.521 --> 02:38:23.970
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

5540
02:38:23.970 --> 02:38:26.100
<v Speaker 4>this is the stuff I'm really excited about now is this,</v>

5541
02:38:26.101 --> 02:38:26.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5542
02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:28.920
<v Speaker 4>the stem cell research and reprogramming,</v>

5543
02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:29.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5544
02:38:29.821 --> 02:38:30.390
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

5545
02:38:30.390 --> 02:38:34.200
<v Speaker 4>the epigenetics is a really cool part where you can reprogram yourself,</v>

5546
02:38:34.450 --> 02:38:34.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5547
02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:35.230
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

5548
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:36.270
<v Speaker 4>to basically be younger.</v>

5549
02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:37.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5550
02:38:37.290 --> 02:38:37.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5551
02:38:37.531 --> 02:38:37.740
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

5552
02:38:37.740 --> 02:38:39.750
<v Speaker 4>they're finding now that that,</v>

5553
02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.010
<v Speaker 4>so epigenetics,</v>

5554
02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:44.850
<v Speaker 4>I think we've talked about this a bit last time refers to changes in gene</v>

5555
02:38:44.851 --> 02:38:47.310
<v Speaker 4>expression and you know,</v>

5556
02:38:47.311 --> 02:38:50.220
<v Speaker 4>things like methyl groups and acetylation groups will sit on top of your DNA and</v>

5557
02:38:50.221 --> 02:38:51.480
<v Speaker 4>turn them on turn genes on and off.</v>

5558
02:38:51.481 --> 02:38:55.350
<v Speaker 4>But now what they're finding is they're trying to look at patterns of</v>

5559
02:38:55.351 --> 02:38:56.190
<v Speaker 4>methylation,</v>

5560
02:38:56.191 --> 02:38:57.390
<v Speaker 4>like in your DNA.</v>

5561
02:38:57.391 --> 02:38:57.780
<v Speaker 4>So they've,</v>

5562
02:38:57.780 --> 02:38:59.660
<v Speaker 4>they've already solved the human genome project where they,</v>

5563
02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:02.340
<v Speaker 4>and they know jeans and now they're trying to look at the,</v>

5564
02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:03.870
<v Speaker 4>that the methylome,</v>

5565
02:39:03.930 --> 02:39:04.860
<v Speaker 4>the human methylome.</v>

5566
02:39:05.430 --> 02:39:07.200
<v Speaker 4>And they've been able to over the past,</v>

5567
02:39:07.201 --> 02:39:07.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5568
02:39:07.441 --> 02:39:08.274
<v Speaker 4>few years,</v>

5569
02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:12.660
<v Speaker 4>they've been able to identify that there's patterns of methylation in your genes</v>

5570
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:14.970
<v Speaker 4>that happen with age.</v>

5571
02:39:15.450 --> 02:39:20.010
<v Speaker 4>And they've even been able to like systematically identify they've,</v>

5572
02:39:20.011 --> 02:39:21.960
<v Speaker 4>so they've taken blood from people,</v>

5573
02:39:22.050 --> 02:39:22.681
<v Speaker 4>various ages,</v>

5574
02:39:22.681 --> 02:39:27.681
<v Speaker 4>like from 19 to 101 and they'd been able to identify the age of the person,</v>

5575
02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:32.220
<v Speaker 4>the chronological age of the person based on their methylation patterns,</v>

5576
02:39:32.221 --> 02:39:34.020
<v Speaker 4>like with 96% accuracy.</v>

5577
02:39:34.290 --> 02:39:37.020
<v Speaker 4>And they've been able to do this like within four years.</v>

5578
02:39:37.021 --> 02:39:38.640
<v Speaker 4>I think they'll some before years off,</v>

5579
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:39.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5580
02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:40.200
<v Speaker 4>plus or minus four years.</v>

5581
02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.970
<v Speaker 4>So they can take someone's blood cells,</v>

5582
02:39:41.971 --> 02:39:46.971
<v Speaker 4>look at their methylation pattern and say your 50 years old and the person will</v>

5583
02:39:47.221 --> 02:39:47.401
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

5584
02:39:47.401 --> 02:39:47.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5585
02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:50.790
<v Speaker 4>50 between 50 and 54 or 46 and 50 you know,</v>

5586
02:39:50.791 --> 02:39:55.170
<v Speaker 4>so I think that's pretty brick and amazing that they're so,</v>

5587
02:39:55.171 --> 02:39:56.610
<v Speaker 4>and the thing that's really cool,</v>

5588
02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:57.790
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

5589
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:58.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5590
02:39:58.140 --> 02:39:58.891
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this kick,</v>

5591
02:39:58.891 --> 02:40:03.750
<v Speaker 4>this epigenetics kick where they've been able to now also look at,</v>

5592
02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:04.733
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5593
02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.300
<v Speaker 4>the cancer cells,</v>

5594
02:40:06.301 --> 02:40:08.520
<v Speaker 4>like in a personal take a tissue or a tumor sample.</v>

5595
02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:10.590
<v Speaker 4>And then a tissue from the same person,</v>

5596
02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:11.280
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

5597
02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:11.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5598
02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:12.720
<v Speaker 4>non tumor tissue,</v>

5599
02:40:12.721 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 4>and they'll at the methylation pattern,</v>

5600
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:19.050
<v Speaker 4>they'll see that the cancer or the tumor tissue ages by like 40% based on the</v>

5601
02:40:19.051 --> 02:40:19.884
<v Speaker 4>methylation pattern.</v>

5602
02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5603
02:40:20.490 --> 02:40:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

5604
02:40:21.391 --> 02:40:23.460
<v Speaker 4>so it's like the cancer cells aging rapidly.</v>

5605
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:27.360
<v Speaker 4>So what's really interesting is now they're looking at what genes,</v>

5606
02:40:27.361 --> 02:40:28.500
<v Speaker 4>these are genes,</v>

5607
02:40:28.501 --> 02:40:31.090
<v Speaker 4>these methylation patterns are happening around and they're finding it to like</v>

5608
02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:32.280
<v Speaker 4>DNA repair,</v>

5609
02:40:32.281 --> 02:40:33.600
<v Speaker 4>mitochondrial metabolism,</v>

5610
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 4>antioxidant genes,</v>

5611
02:40:34.651 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 4>like everything we've been talking about and this whole podcast things that,</v>

5612
02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:38.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5613
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:39.720
<v Speaker 4>affecting the damage and metabolism.</v>

5614
02:40:39.721 --> 02:40:40.530
<v Speaker 4>All of these things,</v>

5615
02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:43.410
<v Speaker 4>methylation patterns are happening clustered around these,</v>

5616
02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:44.400
<v Speaker 4>around these genes.</v>

5617
02:40:44.890 --> 02:40:45.321
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5618
02:40:45.321 --> 02:40:48.420
<v Speaker 4>and the cool thing about it to me is that if we're figuring this out,</v>

5619
02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:53.340
<v Speaker 4>then we can figure out how to reprogram ourselves to be young and extend</v>

5620
02:40:53.341 --> 02:40:53.820
<v Speaker 4>lifespan.</v>

5621
02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:56.160
<v Speaker 4>And I really think that we're getting close to doing this.</v>

5622
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:57.091
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

5623
02:40:57.091 --> 02:40:57.924
<v Speaker 4>if you think about,</v>

5624
02:40:58.560 --> 02:40:59.371
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you an example.</v>

5625
02:40:59.371 --> 02:41:00.270
<v Speaker 4>Like stem cells.</v>

5626
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Stem cells also have methylation patterns that are very distinct to stem cells.</v>

5627
02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 4>And there's certain genes that are when when a gene is methylated,</v>

5628
02:41:09.181 --> 02:41:10.500
<v Speaker 4>it's not being expressed.</v>

5629
02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.650
<v Speaker 4>There are certain genes that are not expressed in stem cells for a reason</v>

5630
02:41:13.651 --> 02:41:14.910
<v Speaker 4>because when they get expressed,</v>

5631
02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:17.700
<v Speaker 4>they cause the cell to stop dividing.</v>

5632
02:41:17.730 --> 02:41:20.100
<v Speaker 4>And you don't want your stem cells to stop dividing because stem cells are</v>

5633
02:41:20.101 --> 02:41:22.110
<v Speaker 4>what's repopulating the tissue.</v>

5634
02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:23.183
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5635
02:41:23.250 --> 02:41:26.970
<v Speaker 4>And they found that like a certain gene is methylated and young people,</v>

5636
02:41:26.971 --> 02:41:27.870
<v Speaker 4>so when we're young,</v>

5637
02:41:27.930 --> 02:41:28.800
<v Speaker 4>our stem cells have,</v>

5638
02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:29.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5639
02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:30.480
<v Speaker 4>this gene is methylated,</v>

5640
02:41:30.690 --> 02:41:31.830
<v Speaker 4>but as we get older,</v>

5641
02:41:32.310 --> 02:41:33.000
<v Speaker 4>the gene,</v>

5642
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 4>the methylation goes away.</v>

5643
02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:36.560
<v Speaker 4>So there's enzymes that actually are called demethylase.</v>

5644
02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Does it take off the methyl groups and this gene becomes active and then the</v>

5645
02:41:39.961 --> 02:41:41.970
<v Speaker 4>stem cell like stops dividing.</v>

5646
02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:42.931
<v Speaker 4>It's like you lose,</v>

5647
02:41:42.931 --> 02:41:46.380
<v Speaker 4>you're basically losing your stem cell and then you know more stem cells,</v>

5648
02:41:46.381 --> 02:41:47.880
<v Speaker 4>you lose the worse off you are.</v>

5649
02:41:47.881 --> 02:41:49.980
<v Speaker 4>You can't replenish your damaged tissue and all that.</v>

5650
02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.850
<v Speaker 4>But what they found was that the thing that activates that thing that takes off</v>

5651
02:41:53.851 --> 02:41:56.400
<v Speaker 4>the methyl group is something called NF Kappa B,</v>

5652
02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.770
<v Speaker 4>which is an inflammatory,</v>

5653
02:41:58.010 --> 02:42:00.330
<v Speaker 4>that that thing is activated by inflammation.</v>

5654
02:42:00.331 --> 02:42:03.810
<v Speaker 4>And I've copied be inflammation activates NF Kappa B and then it activates this</v>

5655
02:42:03.811 --> 02:42:05.940
<v Speaker 4>whole pathway of demethylase,</v>

5656
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:07.110
<v Speaker 4>that takeoff methyl groups.</v>

5657
02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.920
<v Speaker 4>So what I'm thinking is that inflammation is a chronic signal.</v>

5658
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.360
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5659
02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:15.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a way that I've been able to link environment and,</v>

5660
02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:16.320
<v Speaker 4>and the way,</v>

5661
02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.240
<v Speaker 4>when I say environment I just mean like damage,</v>

5662
02:42:18.241 --> 02:42:20.280
<v Speaker 4>constant accumulation of tissue damage,</v>

5663
02:42:20.281 --> 02:42:21.031
<v Speaker 4>the DNA damage.</v>

5664
02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:24.090
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about environment to epigenetics.</v>

5665
02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:26.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's like you have a chronic signal of inflammation.</v>

5666
02:42:26.911 --> 02:42:31.140
<v Speaker 4>It's activating these demethylase is they're taking methyl groups off of DNA and</v>

5667
02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:33.890
<v Speaker 4>now you're expressing genes that are usually not expressed when a,</v>

5668
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:37.290
<v Speaker 4>or young in stem cells that stops the sentence stem cells from dividing.</v>

5669
02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:39.660
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a really cool link between,</v>

5670
02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:40.793
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5671
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.210
<v Speaker 4>environment and,</v>

5672
02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:43.920
<v Speaker 4>and epigenetics that,</v>

5673
02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:44.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5674
02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:45.450
<v Speaker 4>as it relates to aging,</v>

5675
02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:48.990
<v Speaker 4>which we know that environment regulates epigenetics.</v>

5676
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:52.680
<v Speaker 4>So to me it's kind of cool cause as we're figuring out these programs,</v>

5677
02:42:52.681 --> 02:42:57.120
<v Speaker 4>what that means is I think that we'll be able to reprogram our ourselves to</v>

5678
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.870
<v Speaker 4>become young.</v>

5679
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:58.621
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

5680
02:42:58.621 --> 02:43:00.660
<v Speaker 4>How long do you think it was going to be before that happens?</v>

5681
02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're,</v>

5682
02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:04.050
<v Speaker 4>we're getting really close with,</v>

5683
02:43:04.051 --> 02:43:04.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you look at,</v>

5684
02:43:04.681 --> 02:43:08.070
<v Speaker 4>like I said with the stem cell research that we're doing now,</v>

5685
02:43:08.071 --> 02:43:08.904
<v Speaker 4>where we can take,</v>

5686
02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:13.690
<v Speaker 4>we can even take a renal epithelial cells that we excrete in our urine and make</v>

5687
02:43:13.691 --> 02:43:15.420
<v Speaker 4>it into a pluripotent stem cell.</v>

5688
02:43:15.450 --> 02:43:16.450
<v Speaker 4>We can make it become,</v>

5689
02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:17.563
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5690
02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:18.610
<v Speaker 4>you selling our liver.</v>

5691
02:43:18.970 --> 02:43:19.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5692
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:20.620
<v Speaker 4>so I think with,</v>

5693
02:43:20.670 --> 02:43:20.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5694
02:43:20.890 --> 02:43:22.360
<v Speaker 4>the advances we're making with that,</v>

5695
02:43:22.770 --> 02:43:23.603
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5696
02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:25.690
<v Speaker 4>in combination with this learning,</v>

5697
02:43:25.691 --> 02:43:26.230
<v Speaker 4>the looking,</v>

5698
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.850
<v Speaker 4>looking at fight,</v>

5699
02:43:26.850 --> 02:43:29.100
<v Speaker 4>figuring out the human epigenetics Epi genome,</v>

5700
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.201
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

5701
02:43:29.201 --> 02:43:32.230
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at methylation patterns and figuring out what's happening with</v>

5702
02:43:32.231 --> 02:43:33.064
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>

5703
02:43:33.090 --> 02:43:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5704
02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:33.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5705
02:43:33.761 --> 02:43:36.610
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to make huge strides in the next decade.</v>

5706
02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:37.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5707
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:40.330
<v Speaker 4>hopefully if research a funding doesn't go down,</v>

5708
02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:40.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5709
02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:42.490
<v Speaker 4>it's been going down the drain,</v>

5710
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.740
<v Speaker 4>but Eisenman Yeah.</v>

5711
02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5712
02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:47.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean funding is hard.</v>

5713
02:43:47.321 --> 02:43:48.880
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard getting,</v>

5714
02:43:48.881 --> 02:43:50.900
<v Speaker 4>getting funding in science because why is it</v>

5715
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:52.670
<v Speaker 1>with something like anti aging,</v>

5716
02:43:52.671 --> 02:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>it would sound like,</v>

5717
02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:53.571
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

5718
02:43:53.571 --> 02:43:56.090
<v Speaker 1>if there's something to be made where there's money to be made,</v>

5719
02:43:56.091 --> 02:43:59.570
<v Speaker 1>it's funding anti aging research seems like God,</v>

5720
02:43:59.571 --> 02:44:00.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to go.</v>

5721
02:44:00.570 --> 02:44:00.781
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5722
02:44:00.781 --> 02:44:03.360
<v Speaker 4>there is the Nance National Institute of Aging,</v>

5723
02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5724
02:44:04.170 --> 02:44:04.651
<v Speaker 4>funds,</v>

5725
02:44:04.651 --> 02:44:05.211
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the,</v>

5726
02:44:05.211 --> 02:44:07.980
<v Speaker 4>the aging research and there's also some private foundations that are funding</v>

5727
02:44:07.981 --> 02:44:08.550
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

5728
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:09.040
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5729
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:09.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5730
02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:10.200
<v Speaker 4>the reality is,</v>

5731
02:44:10.201 --> 02:44:10.501
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

5732
02:44:10.501 --> 02:44:10.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5733
02:44:10.771 --> 02:44:13.830
<v Speaker 4>these were funding it with taxpayer dollars,</v>

5734
02:44:13.831 --> 02:44:14.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5735
02:44:14.250 --> 02:44:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5736
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:15.120
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5737
02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:15.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5738
02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:19.110
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of money for research in general,</v>

5739
02:44:19.111 --> 02:44:19.471
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

5740
02:44:19.471 --> 02:44:19.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5741
02:44:19.651 --> 02:44:21.090
<v Speaker 4>you'd think that cancer one would be another,</v>

5742
02:44:21.091 --> 02:44:21.361
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5743
02:44:21.361 --> 02:44:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5744
02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:22.710
<v Speaker 4>the Nass,</v>

5745
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:23.370
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5746
02:44:23.370 --> 02:44:26.040
<v Speaker 4>the NCI is funding a lot of cancer research,</v>

5747
02:44:26.370 --> 02:44:27.350
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is,</v>

5748
02:44:27.351 --> 02:44:30.930
<v Speaker 4>is that it's hard to get funding and the things that are funded,</v>

5749
02:44:30.931 --> 02:44:31.231
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

5750
02:44:31.231 --> 02:44:32.550
<v Speaker 4>here's what I see is a big problem.</v>

5751
02:44:32.551 --> 02:44:36.780
<v Speaker 4>The things that are funded by these big institutes are typically things that</v>

5752
02:44:36.781 --> 02:44:37.614
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

5753
02:44:37.890 --> 02:44:38.723
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5754
02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:40.410
<v Speaker 4>already been proven.</v>

5755
02:44:40.410 --> 02:44:43.180
<v Speaker 4>They're not as creative in a,</v>

5756
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:44.023
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5757
02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:46.830
<v Speaker 4>they're the things that people feel are already solid.</v>

5758
02:44:46.890 --> 02:44:47.340
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

5759
02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:47.461
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5760
02:44:47.461 --> 02:44:48.510
<v Speaker 4>you already published on this.</v>

5761
02:44:48.511 --> 02:44:48.721
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

5762
02:44:48.721 --> 02:44:49.770
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fund you on that.</v>

5763
02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:50.340
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5764
02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:52.590
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to someone that has this very creative idea,</v>

5765
02:44:52.591 --> 02:44:53.610
<v Speaker 4>it's very risky.</v>

5766
02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5767
02:44:54.450 --> 02:44:54.721
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

5768
02:44:54.721 --> 02:44:55.201
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5769
02:44:55.201 --> 02:44:55.651
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to,</v>

5770
02:44:55.651 --> 02:44:55.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5771
02:44:55.981 --> 02:44:58.080
<v Speaker 4>there's all these other people that are trying to compete for this money.</v>

5772
02:44:58.290 --> 02:45:00.720
<v Speaker 4>Giving funding for something like that is risky.</v>

5773
02:45:00.721 --> 02:45:02.850
<v Speaker 4>So they don't fund a lot of creative research,</v>

5774
02:45:02.940 --> 02:45:06.810
<v Speaker 4>which unfortunately is what makes leaps in science.</v>

5775
02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:11.700
<v Speaker 1>This mice thing is so fascinating because they show that after four weeks stem</v>

5776
02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:16.701
<v Speaker 1>cells in both the areas of the muscle and the brain kind of boost of activity</v>

5777
02:45:17.130 --> 02:45:20.220
<v Speaker 1>and we're better able to produce neurons and muscle tissue.</v>

5778
02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And then they also discovered that injecting the old mice or,</v>

5779
02:45:25.090 --> 02:45:28.770
<v Speaker 1>or rather with the young mice with old blood was a huge setback,</v>

5780
02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:30.990
<v Speaker 1>was a huge setback,</v>

5781
02:45:31.310 --> 02:45:31.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5782
02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>when conjoined to a,</v>

5783
02:45:32.881 --> 02:45:33.900
<v Speaker 1>an older mouse.</v>

5784
02:45:33.901 --> 02:45:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

5785
02:45:34.590 --> 02:45:34.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5786
02:45:34.831 --> 02:45:36.690
<v Speaker 1>bringing the old blood into the new mouse,</v>

5787
02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the creation of new cells in the young mouse slowed and old blood seemed to</v>

5788
02:45:41.401 --> 02:45:42.990
<v Speaker 1>cause premature aging.</v>

5789
02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:43.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5790
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.650
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

5791
02:45:44.650 --> 02:45:45.483
<v Speaker 4>It is incredible.</v>

5792
02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:46.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5793
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:46.740
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5794
02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but how long before people start fucking doing something gross,</v>

5795
02:45:50.791 --> 02:45:52.830
<v Speaker 1>like taking a person,</v>

5796
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:54.120
<v Speaker 1>stealing their blood,</v>

5797
02:45:54.450 --> 02:45:55.520
<v Speaker 1>introducing me to their own,</v>

5798
02:45:55.530 --> 02:45:56.161
<v Speaker 1>stay young.</v>

5799
02:45:56.161 --> 02:45:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5800
02:45:56.461 --> 02:45:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's really vampirism.</v>

5801
02:45:57.970 --> 02:45:58.803
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5802
02:45:58.880 --> 02:45:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5803
02:45:59.190 --> 02:46:01.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean for sure.</v>

5804
02:46:01.470 --> 02:46:01.681
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

5805
02:46:01.681 --> 02:46:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Now I remember that someone has read this.</v>

5806
02:46:04.210 --> 02:46:05.350
<v Speaker 4>I think I remember that study now.</v>

5807
02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:07.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to grab another water please.</v>

5808
02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:07.893
<v Speaker 4>This one right there.</v>

5809
02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.033
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5810
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:11.810
<v Speaker 1>well this study,</v>

5811
02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:12.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5812
02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:15.890
<v Speaker 1>it was published on,</v>

5813
02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:16.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5814
02:46:16.850 --> 02:46:17.960
<v Speaker 1>in the Washington Post.</v>

5815
02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:20.000
<v Speaker 1>The article was published on May 4th.</v>

5816
02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5817
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and the study,</v>

5818
02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:24.200
<v Speaker 1>two of the studies published online.</v>

5819
02:46:24.201 --> 02:46:26.630
<v Speaker 1>The Journal of science came out.</v>

5820
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5821
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>let's see here.</v>

5822
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5823
02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:33.530
<v Speaker 1>One of them was from Stanford,</v>

5824
02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the Stanford Group.</v>

5825
02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:35.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5826
02:46:35.451 --> 02:46:35.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5827
02:46:35.610 --> 02:46:35.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5828
02:46:35.841 --> 02:46:36.021
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5829
02:46:36.021 --> 02:46:38.600
<v Speaker 1>apparently they've been working on this for quite a while,</v>

5830
02:46:38.810 --> 02:46:41.780
<v Speaker 1>but the results of the,</v>

5831
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:41.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5832
02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:42.221
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5833
02:46:42.221 --> 02:46:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the blood results have been pretty shocking to a lot of people.</v>

5834
02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5835
02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:47.600
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it comes down to,</v>

5836
02:46:47.601 --> 02:46:47.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5837
02:46:47.781 --> 02:46:48.201
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

5838
02:46:48.201 --> 02:46:49.034
<v Speaker 4>there's these,</v>

5839
02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:50.630
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the epigenome,</v>

5840
02:46:50.631 --> 02:46:53.030
<v Speaker 4>the methylation patterns and these stem cells,</v>

5841
02:46:53.031 --> 02:46:54.200
<v Speaker 4>these young stem cells,</v>

5842
02:46:54.410 --> 02:46:55.730
<v Speaker 4>even young cells in general,</v>

5843
02:46:55.731 --> 02:46:58.000
<v Speaker 4>they're very different from old ones.</v>

5844
02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5845
02:46:58.320 --> 02:46:59.420
<v Speaker 4>And that affects the way,</v>

5846
02:46:59.421 --> 02:46:59.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5847
02:46:59.661 --> 02:47:00.980
<v Speaker 4>if you're looking at epigenetics,</v>

5848
02:47:00.981 --> 02:47:03.800
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about regulating a whole host of jeans,</v>

5849
02:47:03.801 --> 02:47:05.090
<v Speaker 4>like hundreds of different genes.</v>

5850
02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.060
<v Speaker 4>And so if these things are being differentially regulated when you're young</v>

5851
02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:13.300
<v Speaker 4>versus old than taking someone's young blood and transplanting into the old,</v>

5852
02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:16.130
<v Speaker 4>old a transplant,</v>

5853
02:47:16.131 --> 02:47:18.020
<v Speaker 4>he would make sense because now you're,</v>

5854
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:18.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5855
02:47:18.861 --> 02:47:19.131
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

5856
02:47:19.131 --> 02:47:20.840
<v Speaker 4>you're basically taking all those,</v>

5857
02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:22.113
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5858
02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:24.050
<v Speaker 4>patterns that we,</v>

5859
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:27.530
<v Speaker 4>that we've been able to identify and gene expression things are now going back</v>

5860
02:47:27.531 --> 02:47:27.981
<v Speaker 4>to young.</v>

5861
02:47:27.981 --> 02:47:29.000
<v Speaker 4>So it's like now you're,</v>

5862
02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:32.950
<v Speaker 4>you're not expressing genes that are causing your stem cells to Sundance.</v>

5863
02:47:33.010 --> 02:47:36.140
<v Speaker 4>You're not expressing your expressing more things that are involved in DNA</v>

5864
02:47:36.141 --> 02:47:37.310
<v Speaker 4>repair and things like that.</v>

5865
02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:38.353
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5866
02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:39.241
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>

5867
02:47:39.241 --> 02:47:39.480
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5868
02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:40.650
<v Speaker 1>what they were able to do,</v>

5869
02:47:40.651 --> 02:47:40.791
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5870
02:47:40.791 --> 02:47:42.990
<v Speaker 1>they actually had more a endurance.</v>

5871
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:44.700
<v Speaker 1>They navigated mazes faster,</v>

5872
02:47:44.701 --> 02:47:46.170
<v Speaker 1>ran longer on treadmills,</v>

5873
02:47:46.171 --> 02:47:47.340
<v Speaker 1>and they easily outperformed,</v>

5874
02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:48.730
<v Speaker 1>performed their control peers.</v>

5875
02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5876
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:49.231
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

5877
02:47:49.231 --> 02:47:53.190
<v Speaker 1>We were only given céline so it's like a definitive response.</v>

5878
02:47:53.850 --> 02:47:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5879
02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:55.060
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>

5880
02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:56.210
<v Speaker 4>it's such a creepy one,</v>

5881
02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5882
02:47:56.910 --> 02:48:01.530
<v Speaker 4>But I think this is something that we can do with the reprogramming of our own,</v>

5883
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:05.160
<v Speaker 4>like skin cells into like pluripotent stem cells.</v>

5884
02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5885
02:48:05.890 --> 02:48:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And d w Yes.</v>

5886
02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:07.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5887
02:48:07.791 --> 02:48:08.121
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

5888
02:48:08.121 --> 02:48:09.200
<v Speaker 1>that's really fascinating.</v>

5889
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5890
02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:10.760
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same concept,</v>

5891
02:48:10.761 --> 02:48:12.260
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to get someone's young blood.</v>

5892
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:13.400
<v Speaker 4>You're doing it to yourself.</v>

5893
02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:16.520
<v Speaker 1>And how would they been able to come up with artificial blood cells?</v>

5894
02:48:16.521 --> 02:48:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that another thing that they've been working on?</v>

5895
02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:19.030
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5896
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:20.000
<v Speaker 4>that sounds familiar.</v>

5897
02:48:20.001 --> 02:48:20.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5898
02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:21.313
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

5899
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:23.390
<v Speaker 4>Are artificial heart cells as well?</v>

5900
02:48:23.410 --> 02:48:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

5901
02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:25.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5902
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:25.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5903
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:25.941
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

5904
02:48:25.941 --> 02:48:26.774
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

5905
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember exactly the studies and the mechanisms.</v>

5906
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:31.243
<v Speaker 4>It's just so much.</v>

5907
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:31.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5908
02:48:31.970 --> 02:48:32.490
<v Speaker 4>although it is,</v>

5909
02:48:32.490 --> 02:48:32.550
<v Speaker 4>it is</v>

5910
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:33.930
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get funding.</v>

5911
02:48:33.931 --> 02:48:35.640
<v Speaker 1>There are so many different,</v>

5912
02:48:36.390 --> 02:48:36.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5913
02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Artificial blood.</v>

5914
02:48:37.650 --> 02:48:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5915
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Patient ready.</v>

5916
02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.171
<v Speaker 1>This is on,</v>

5917
02:48:40.171 --> 02:48:40.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5918
02:48:40.530 --> 02:48:41.600
<v Speaker 1>from uh,</v>

5919
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:46.670
<v Speaker 1>the-scientists.com and it's saying that a,</v>

5920
02:48:46.890 --> 02:48:47.723
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5921
02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:48.713
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

5922
02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And the myths of a news that engineered organs are being implanted into animals</v>

5923
02:48:53.551 --> 02:48:54.091
<v Speaker 1>and people.</v>

5924
02:48:54.091 --> 02:48:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Researchers announced the creation of artificial blood for transplant.</v>

5925
02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:01.080
<v Speaker 1>This is a very recent to April 16th.</v>

5926
02:49:02.310 --> 02:49:03.143
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

5927
02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:06.780
<v Speaker 1>We live in strange times when it comes to these things like every day or so it</v>

5928
02:49:06.781 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 1>seems some new study</v>

5929
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:11.550
<v Speaker 5>from somewhere in the world is popping up that shows us incredible breakthrough.</v>

5930
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.320
<v Speaker 5>The young mice study this study,</v>

5931
02:49:13.321 --> 02:49:15.300
<v Speaker 5>the artificial blood story study,</v>

5932
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:19.680
<v Speaker 5>if they can engineer some sort of a super potent blood and introduced into your</v>

5933
02:49:19.681 --> 02:49:19.981
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

5934
02:49:19.981 --> 02:49:20.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5935
02:49:20.101 --> 02:49:23.640
<v Speaker 5>it's similar to like what the cyclists did when they were blood doping.</v>

5936
02:49:23.641 --> 02:49:25.020
<v Speaker 5>They would take their own blood,</v>

5937
02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:25.913
<v Speaker 5>pull it out,</v>

5938
02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:29.490
<v Speaker 5>injected back into their body so they had more blood or Epo,</v>

5939
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:30.061
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

5940
02:49:30.061 --> 02:49:30.894
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5941
02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:32.760
<v Speaker 5>stimulated red blood cell production.</v>

5942
02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5943
02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:33.631
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

5944
02:49:33.631 --> 02:49:34.860
<v Speaker 5>that kind of stuff is just,</v>

5945
02:49:34.861 --> 02:49:35.051
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

5946
02:49:35.051 --> 02:49:35.940
<v Speaker 5>it's so trippy,</v>

5947
02:49:35.941 --> 02:49:39.450
<v Speaker 5>the idea of sort of hacking and retweaking the,</v>

5948
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:41.130
<v Speaker 5>the components of the human body</v>

5949
02:49:41.470 --> 02:49:42.170
<v Speaker 4>IRA.</v>

5950
02:49:42.170 --> 02:49:43.670
<v Speaker 4>But I do think it's really cool.</v>

5951
02:49:43.671 --> 02:49:43.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5952
02:49:43.971 --> 02:49:45.470
<v Speaker 4>I know when I first,</v>

5953
02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:48.170
<v Speaker 4>when I first got into the biological sciences,</v>

5954
02:49:48.171 --> 02:49:50.300
<v Speaker 4>so I was a chemistry major in college.</v>

5955
02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I did research using,</v>

5956
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5957
02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:53.540
<v Speaker 4>these nematode worms,</v>

5958
02:49:53.541 --> 02:49:54.374
<v Speaker 4>see Allegan worms,</v>

5959
02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:55.273
<v Speaker 4>worms,</v>

5960
02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:55.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5961
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:57.950
<v Speaker 4>that have like a 14 or 15 day lifespan.</v>

5962
02:49:58.610 --> 02:50:00.710
<v Speaker 4>And they have a lot of the same genes that we have,</v>

5963
02:50:00.711 --> 02:50:04.910
<v Speaker 4>but I could like inactivate one of their genes and literally double their</v>

5964
02:50:04.911 --> 02:50:05.391
<v Speaker 4>lifespan.</v>

5965
02:50:05.391 --> 02:50:08.510
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't went from living like 14 or 15 days to like 30 days.</v>

5966
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:10.430
<v Speaker 4>And so this was actually,</v>

5967
02:50:10.431 --> 02:50:11.060
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

5968
02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:15.860
<v Speaker 4>you inactivate insulin growth signaling insulin growth factor.</v>

5969
02:50:16.610 --> 02:50:17.840
<v Speaker 4>And what happens is it,</v>

5970
02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:18.111
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5971
02:50:18.111 --> 02:50:18.710
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

5972
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:19.390
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

5973
02:50:19.390 --> 02:50:19.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5974
02:50:19.700 --> 02:50:20.391
<v Speaker 4>growth factor.</v>

5975
02:50:20.391 --> 02:50:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Then,</v>

5976
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.351
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5977
02:50:21.351 --> 02:50:23.060
<v Speaker 4>usually when it's active it,</v>

5978
02:50:23.660 --> 02:50:23.961
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

5979
02:50:23.961 --> 02:50:24.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5980
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:25.880
<v Speaker 4>keeps the Fox,</v>

5981
02:50:25.881 --> 02:50:26.691
<v Speaker 4>this foxo gene,</v>

5982
02:50:26.691 --> 02:50:30.530
<v Speaker 4>which is a transcription factor outside of the nucleus and doesn't allow it to</v>

5983
02:50:30.531 --> 02:50:32.510
<v Speaker 4>perform all the functions that usually performs,</v>

5984
02:50:32.511 --> 02:50:36.230
<v Speaker 4>which is involved in a bunch of stress resistance like hundreds and hundreds of</v>

5985
02:50:36.350 --> 02:50:37.040
<v Speaker 4>genes.</v>

5986
02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:40.170
<v Speaker 4>And so when you'd get rid of that IGF one signaling in the worms box,</v>

5987
02:50:40.171 --> 02:50:43.220
<v Speaker 4>so gets activated and all of those genes and Bob and stress resistance get</v>

5988
02:50:43.221 --> 02:50:45.740
<v Speaker 4>activated and the worms live twice as long.</v>

5989
02:50:46.250 --> 02:50:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So it's like literally a genetic program in these worms that's controlling the</v>

5990
02:50:50.571 --> 02:50:51.404
<v Speaker 4>way the age.</v>

5991
02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:53.150
<v Speaker 4>So when I first,</v>

5992
02:50:53.151 --> 02:50:55.190
<v Speaker 4>I remember that hit me,</v>

5993
02:50:55.191 --> 02:50:56.024
<v Speaker 4>it was kinda like,</v>

5994
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:57.410
<v Speaker 4>holy crap.</v>

5995

<v Speaker 4>Like that's pretty cool.</v>

5996
02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Like being able to reprogram the way you age.</v>

5997
02:51:02.770 --> 02:51:06.850
<v Speaker 5>It's just such an amazing time with all this stuff cause it seems like we're</v>

5998
02:51:06.851 --> 02:51:10.240
<v Speaker 5>around at just the right time to catch this.</v>

5999
02:51:10.241 --> 02:51:15.241
<v Speaker 5>Just incredible perculating of all these new studies and all these new things</v>

6000
02:51:15.761 --> 02:51:16.720
<v Speaker 5>that are being developed.</v>

6001
02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:17.671
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

6002
02:51:17.671 --> 02:51:21.130
<v Speaker 5>just such a strange time to like try to pay attention to all of it and watch it</v>

6003
02:51:21.131 --> 02:51:21.671
<v Speaker 5>all happen.</v>

6004
02:51:21.671 --> 02:51:22.660
<v Speaker 5>It's so exciting.</v>

6005
02:51:22.810 --> 02:51:27.370
<v Speaker 5>It must be really exciting for you because this is like your field of study.</v>

6006
02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:27.891
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

6007
02:51:27.891 --> 02:51:28.521
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

6008
02:51:28.521 --> 02:51:28.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6009
02:51:28.761 --> 02:51:30.320
<v Speaker 4>I think we're definitely going to live longer,</v>

6010
02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:31.340
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

6011
02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:31.710
<v Speaker 4>How long do you,</v>

6012
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:31.770
<v Speaker 4>do you</v>

6013
02:51:31.770 --> 02:51:32.603
<v Speaker 5>think you're going to live</v>

6014
02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:34.950
<v Speaker 5>in my lifetime?</v>

6015
02:51:35.370 --> 02:51:36.001
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

6016
02:51:36.001 --> 02:51:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm going without,</v>

6017
02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:37.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6018
02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.130
<v Speaker 5>without really programming.</v>

6019
02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:38.521
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6020
02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:42.260
<v Speaker 5>without you mean just that little stone erupting or asteroid impacts or,</v>

6021
02:51:42.261 --> 02:51:42.421
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6022
02:51:42.421 --> 02:51:42.900
<v Speaker 5>I'd like,</v>

6023
02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:44.220
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to be a centenarian.</v>

6024
02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:45.460
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

6027
02:51:49.070 --> 02:51:49.590
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

6028
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:53.580
<v Speaker 5>what if a hundred comes around and they've got shit locked down where you look</v>

6029
02:51:53.581 --> 02:51:57.570
<v Speaker 5>like you look now at a hundred and then I could go for 200</v>

6030
02:51:59.250 --> 02:51:59.401
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

6031
02:51:59.401 --> 02:52:02.520
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm happier now than I was when I was younger.</v>

6032
02:52:02.521 --> 02:52:03.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm smarter.</v>

6033
02:52:03.630 --> 02:52:05.470
<v Speaker 5>I understand stress better.</v>

6034
02:52:05.471 --> 02:52:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I understand</v>

6035
02:52:06.850 --> 02:52:08.440
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of the emotion,</v>

6036

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6037
02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I understand management management of my body,</v>

6038
02:52:11.441 --> 02:52:13.090
<v Speaker 1>of my hormones,</v>

6039
02:52:13.091 --> 02:52:14.740
<v Speaker 1>management of my feelings,</v>

6040
02:52:14.741 --> 02:52:16.540
<v Speaker 1>management of my energy levels,</v>

6041
02:52:16.541 --> 02:52:17.374
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

6042
02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:20.350
<v Speaker 1>relaxation techniques to stretching,</v>

6043
02:52:20.351 --> 02:52:20.771
<v Speaker 1>yoga,</v>

6044
02:52:20.771 --> 02:52:21.604
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff.</v>

6045
02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm just way happier and it said that old expression,</v>

6046
02:52:25.811 --> 02:52:27.190
<v Speaker 1>youth is wasted on the young,</v>

6047
02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:27.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6048
02:52:27.971 --> 02:52:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like I understand life better.</v>

6049
02:52:29.921 --> 02:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm better at it now.</v>

6050
02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm better at being me.</v>

6051
02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:33.251
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

6052
02:52:33.251 --> 02:52:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it was an awkward thing when I was younger.</v>

6053
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm way more relaxed and easy with it now.</v>

6054
02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I feel like at 200 I'd be a goddamn wizard.</v>

6055
02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

6056
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I would have shit down to a science.</v>

6057
02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I would have the amount of errors that I'd make as far as you know,</v>

6058
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.903
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

6059
02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:51.700
<v Speaker 1>every day average things that you fuck up,</v>

6060
02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you would fuck up almost nothing.</v>

6061
02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:54.640
<v Speaker 1>It would every day would be like,</v>

6062
02:52:54.850 --> 02:52:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to learn new things.</v>

6063
02:52:56.861 --> 02:52:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You could challenge yourself.</v>

6064
02:52:57.911 --> 02:52:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd constantly learning languages.</v>

6065
02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I never understand the people that say like,</v>

6066
02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:01.511
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6067
02:53:01.511 --> 02:53:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I get bored.</v>

6068
02:53:02.411 --> 02:53:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even want to live past a certain age.</v>

6069
02:53:04.430 --> 02:53:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know,</v>

6070
02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:06.910
<v Speaker 1>but I never get bored.</v>

6071
02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:08.920
<v Speaker 1>There's always new things to learn,</v>

6072
02:53:08.921 --> 02:53:10.670
<v Speaker 1>new things or study the new thing.</v>

6073
02:53:10.671 --> 02:53:11.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

6074
02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:12.970
<v Speaker 1>the world is so big,</v>

6075
02:53:12.971 --> 02:53:14.550
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to learn.</v>

6076
02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:18.780
<v Speaker 2>It would be awesome to just have time to sit around and learn how to play the</v>

6077
02:53:18.781 --> 02:53:19.351
<v Speaker 2>piano,</v>

6078
02:53:19.351 --> 02:53:21.120
<v Speaker 2>learn how to speak a new language.</v>

6079
02:53:21.121 --> 02:53:23.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm always sitting around reading about science,</v>

6080
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:24.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6081
02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:25.380
<v Speaker 2>which I really enjoyed doing.</v>

6082
02:53:25.381 --> 02:53:26.490
<v Speaker 2>But I agree.</v>

6083
02:53:26.491 --> 02:53:26.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6084
02:53:26.731 --> 02:53:31.350
<v Speaker 2>there's so much out there to learn and you might get to a point if you're 200</v>

6085
02:53:31.351 --> 02:53:31.621
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

6086
02:53:31.621 --> 02:53:33.570
<v Speaker 2>he might've Bandon science totally.</v>

6087
02:53:33.571 --> 02:53:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And just fucking go down some totally different roads.</v>

6088
02:53:36.451 --> 02:53:37.470
<v Speaker 2>You might be a sculptor,</v>

6089
02:53:37.471 --> 02:53:37.831
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>

6090
02:53:37.831 --> 02:53:38.091
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

6091
02:53:38.091 --> 02:53:38.671
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

6092
02:53:38.671 --> 02:53:39.504
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6093
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you could live several lives and still be active.</v>

6094
02:53:42.961 --> 02:53:43.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6095
02:53:43.171 --> 02:53:44.004
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

6096
02:53:44.190 --> 02:53:45.660
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in San Diego,</v>

6097
02:53:45.661 --> 02:53:46.231
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

6098
02:53:46.231 --> 02:53:47.064
<v Speaker 2>I was a surf,</v>

6099
02:53:47.130 --> 02:53:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I was a surfer and surf instructor and I used to sterling.</v>

6100
02:53:50.110 --> 02:53:51.140
<v Speaker 2>You instructed people,</v>

6101
02:53:51.180 --> 02:53:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I used to teach an all girls' surf school in La Jolla.</v>

6102
02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I love La Jolla.</v>

6103
02:53:55.730 --> 02:53:55.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6104
02:53:55.961 --> 02:53:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I used to live two blocks from the beach side,</v>

6105
02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:01.800
<v Speaker 2>walk to the beach before on fire right now to see all that stuff about San</v>

6106
02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Diego.</v>

6107
02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6108
02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:04.140
<v Speaker 2>you haven't seen my family's there.</v>

6109
02:54:04.170 --> 02:54:04.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6110
02:54:04.681 --> 02:54:07.140
<v Speaker 2>San Diego's experiencing crazy fires right now.</v>

6111
02:54:07.230 --> 02:54:07.591
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6112
02:54:07.591 --> 02:54:08.424
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

6113
02:54:08.440 --> 02:54:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Huge tornadoes of fire a hundred feet high.</v>

6114
02:54:11.580 --> 02:54:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Well I haven't gotten a phone call,</v>

6115
02:54:13.021 --> 02:54:14.010
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good idea.</v>

6116
02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean good sign.</v>

6117
02:54:15.410 --> 02:54:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Well you mean the fire departments down there on top of it because they have to</v>

6118
02:54:19.011 --> 02:54:21.260
<v Speaker 1>deal with this stuff every couple of years.</v>

6119
02:54:21.261 --> 02:54:21.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6120
02:54:21.501 --> 02:54:23.720
<v Speaker 1>there was the big one a couple of years ago,</v>

6121
02:54:23.721 --> 02:54:24.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6122
02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I was scheduled to go down and do a show and there was these big fires and it</v>

6123
02:54:28.341 --> 02:54:29.330
<v Speaker 1>was so crazy.</v>

6124
02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I wound up doing the show,</v>

6125
02:54:31.941 --> 02:54:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but I said I had,</v>

6126
02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I donated all the money to the Red Cross.</v>

6127
02:54:35.271 --> 02:54:35.511
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6128
02:54:35.511 --> 02:54:36.344
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

6129
02:54:36.530 --> 02:54:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you mean there was so many people off their houses.</v>

6130
02:54:38.541 --> 02:54:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like it would be so gross to go down there and just make money.</v>

6131
02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:42.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6132
02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I remember back in like,</v>

6133
02:54:45.010 --> 02:54:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like 2002 or something.</v>

6134
02:54:47.021 --> 02:54:50.710
<v Speaker 2>When we had a really big fire in San Diego and I was actually out surfing,</v>

6135
02:54:50.711 --> 02:54:55.711
<v Speaker 2>I was in the water and it was really weird because there were all these pelicans</v>

6136
02:54:56.261 --> 02:54:59.470
<v Speaker 2>and all these birds flocking to the water.</v>

6137
02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

6138
02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:00.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6139
02:55:00.341 --> 02:55:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting out on my surfboard looking out in the horizon,</v>

6140
02:55:02.291 --> 02:55:02.891
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the wave.</v>

6141
02:55:02.891 --> 02:55:03.724
<v Speaker 2>And it's like</v>

6142
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:04.910
<v Speaker 4>the apocalypse,</v>

6143
02:55:04.911 --> 02:55:07.460
<v Speaker 4>like birds were just coming to the water,</v>

6144
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:08.240
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6145
02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:08.631
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

6146
02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:09.770
<v Speaker 4>why is going on?</v>

6147
02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:12.980
<v Speaker 4>So I get out of the water and there's just ash falling.</v>

6148
02:55:12.981 --> 02:55:13.250
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

6149
02:55:13.250 --> 02:55:13.670
<v Speaker 4>cause my,</v>

6150
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:14.271
<v Speaker 4>my car was,</v>

6151
02:55:14.271 --> 02:55:15.081
<v Speaker 4>I was in La Jolla shores,</v>

6152
02:55:15.081 --> 02:55:17.780
<v Speaker 4>the time of cars in the parking lot and there was just ash,</v>

6153
02:55:17.781 --> 02:55:19.760
<v Speaker 4>like all over the cars and parking lot.</v>

6154
02:55:19.761 --> 02:55:21.170
<v Speaker 4>But it was like the field,</v>

6155
02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:25.430
<v Speaker 4>that moment where I was sitting on my board and all the birds like came to the</v>

6156
02:55:25.431 --> 02:55:25.671
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

6157
02:55:25.671 --> 02:55:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Like I had this almost like,</v>

6158
02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:27.831
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

6159
02:55:27.831 --> 02:55:30.610
<v Speaker 4>it's a nuclear warfare or something that you,</v>

6160
02:55:30.611 --> 02:55:30.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6161
02:55:30.801 --> 02:55:31.640
<v Speaker 4>that niggery mom.</v>

6162
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

6163
02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:35.630
<v Speaker 4>have you ever had one of those where you just get this eerie feeling where it's</v>

6164
02:55:35.631 --> 02:55:35.811
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

6165
02:55:35.811 --> 02:55:36.410
<v Speaker 4>it's the end.</v>

6166
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:36.950
<v Speaker 4>This is it,</v>

6167
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:37.783
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

6168
02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:38.421
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

6169
02:55:38.421 --> 02:55:38.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6170
02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:39.100
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

6171
02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:41.900
<v Speaker 4>that fire burned a lot of really close to where my dad lives.</v>

6172
02:55:41.901 --> 02:55:42.734
<v Speaker 4>Actually</v>

6173
02:55:43.230 --> 02:55:44.400
<v Speaker 5>do it it twice out here.</v>

6174
02:55:45.150 --> 02:55:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

6175
02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:45.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6176
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:46.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6177
02:55:46.141 --> 02:55:48.930
<v Speaker 5>My neighborhood came really close to times,</v>

6178
02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:49.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6179
02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:51.120
<v Speaker 5>to a giant fires,</v>

6180
02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:51.931
<v Speaker 5>but I mean we,</v>

6181
02:55:51.931 --> 02:55:55.350
<v Speaker 5>we have fires that are so bad out here one time while we're doing it.</v>

6182
02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:55.950
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6183
02:55:55.950 --> 02:55:57.510
<v Speaker 5>and this was the time I got evacuated.</v>

6184
02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:03.210
<v Speaker 5>I was filming fear factor and I drove from Los Angeles to,</v>

6185
02:56:03.211 --> 02:56:04.650
<v Speaker 5>to hone ranch to hone.</v>

6186
02:56:04.651 --> 02:56:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Ranch is about an hour and a half outside of La.</v>

6187
02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:11.790
<v Speaker 5>And as I was driving near Simi Valley,</v>

6188
02:56:11.791 --> 02:56:13.530
<v Speaker 5>which is about 40 minutes from here,</v>

6189
02:56:14.430 --> 02:56:17.160
<v Speaker 5>Simi Valley is where the fire kicked in.</v>

6190
02:56:17.430 --> 02:56:22.430
<v Speaker 5>And then four from there for the next 50 minutes of driving,</v>

6191
02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:23.460
<v Speaker 5>there was no fire.</v>

6192
02:56:23.850 --> 02:56:24.241
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6193
02:56:24.241 --> 02:56:25.350
<v Speaker 5>when I got to work,</v>

6194
02:56:25.351 --> 02:56:26.340
<v Speaker 5>we started filming,</v>

6195
02:56:26.341 --> 02:56:28.260
<v Speaker 5>we were doing the show and then,</v>

6196
02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:28.670
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6197
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:30.330
<v Speaker 5>when we were done and we left,</v>

6198
02:56:30.331 --> 02:56:31.980
<v Speaker 5>the fire had reached us.</v>

6199
02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:34.140
<v Speaker 5>So the fire had reached,</v>

6200
02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:34.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6201
02:56:34.711 --> 02:56:36.570
<v Speaker 5>an hour of driving.</v>

6202
02:56:36.571 --> 02:56:37.710
<v Speaker 5>So we've talking about,</v>

6203
02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:37.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6204
02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:42.920
<v Speaker 5>somewhere around 60 plus miles and the entire right side of the road was like a</v>

6205
02:56:42.931 --> 02:56:44.250
<v Speaker 5>Lord of the rings movie.</v>

6206
02:56:44.490 --> 02:56:44.761
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6207
02:56:44.761 --> 02:56:47.880
<v Speaker 5>I was expecting a demon to ride a flaming over.</v>

6208
02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:50.190
<v Speaker 5>It was insane for an hour,</v>

6209
02:56:50.191 --> 02:56:51.330
<v Speaker 5>an hour of driving,</v>

6210
02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:54.060
<v Speaker 5>all you saw to the right side of you was flames.</v>

6211
02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:55.350
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>

6212
02:56:55.351 --> 02:56:58.170
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that separated it was the highway and flames were jumping the</v>

6213
02:56:58.171 --> 02:56:59.880
<v Speaker 5>highway and you know,</v>

6214
02:56:59.881 --> 02:57:00.041
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

6215
02:57:00.041 --> 02:57:03.900
<v Speaker 5>they had tried to keep the fire as far away from the roads and farther away from</v>

6216
02:57:03.901 --> 02:57:04.471
<v Speaker 5>structures.</v>

6217
02:57:04.471 --> 02:57:09.471
<v Speaker 5>But it was so out of control that had traveled 50 miles plus in a few hours.</v>

6218
02:57:09.570 --> 02:57:10.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a place like,</v>

6219
02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:11.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6220
02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:14.250
<v Speaker 4>this like la or San Diego where there's a lot of dry,</v>

6221
02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:15.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6222
02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:15.750
<v Speaker 4>brush and,</v>

6223
02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:18.270
<v Speaker 4>and like what kind of mechanisms do they have to,</v>

6224
02:57:18.271 --> 02:57:20.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean they obviously know this can be a serious problem.</v>

6225
02:57:20.881 --> 02:57:21.151
<v Speaker 4>Do that.</v>

6226
02:57:21.151 --> 02:57:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Is there any sort of like,</v>

6227
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:23.170
<v Speaker 5>there's not much they can do.</v>

6228
02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:24.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean they try to stop it.</v>

6229
02:57:24.491 --> 02:57:24.700
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

6230
02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:25.810
<v Speaker 5>they create fire breaks,</v>

6231
02:57:25.811 --> 02:57:27.220
<v Speaker 5>they drop repellents on it,</v>

6232
02:57:27.221 --> 02:57:28.510
<v Speaker 5>they dropped this red stuff.</v>

6233
02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:31.350
<v Speaker 5>That's a that that squashes the fire like in,</v>

6234
02:57:31.351 --> 02:57:32.021
<v Speaker 5>in certain areas.</v>

6235
02:57:32.021 --> 02:57:33.490
<v Speaker 5>But this fire leaps.</v>

6236
02:57:33.491 --> 02:57:35.650
<v Speaker 5>The problem is these things cross highways,</v>

6237
02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:37.690
<v Speaker 5>they are the embers fly through the air.</v>

6238
02:57:37.691 --> 02:57:39.730
<v Speaker 5>They land and dry brush and poof,</v>

6239
02:57:39.731 --> 02:57:40.660
<v Speaker 5>they're off to the races.</v>

6240
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.890
<v Speaker 5>We're running out of time.</v>

6241
02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:42.850
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6242

6253
