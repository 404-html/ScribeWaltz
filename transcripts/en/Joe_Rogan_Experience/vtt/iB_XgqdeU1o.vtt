00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.560

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 2>it's the handshake and then it's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>when someone actually looks you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>

13
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to be intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you do for living is</v>

14
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the craziest things a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being can do.</v>

15
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's up there for a job.</v>

16
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>How fast do you go?</v>

17
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>

18
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

19
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar's top speed is probably 2:15 indy</v>

20
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more like 2:40 and I'm going to do</v>

21
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 2>the Daytona 500 next month and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>indy 500 in May.</v>

22
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 2>those are going to be my last few races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm the last one's ever.</v>

24
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

25
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

26
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 2>this is my Danica double goodbye to her.</v>

27
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we do an a Danica double</v>

28
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>goodbye?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it enough?</v>

29
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.214
<v Speaker 1>Is Enough?</v>

30
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love racing but I love other</v>
<v Speaker 2>things too.</v>

32
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with transitioning out and</v>

34
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of things that were kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just pointing me in this direction in</v>

35
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 2>2017 stuff that has never happened to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

36
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of,</v>

37
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>head towards the exit a little bit,</v>

38
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 2>but I'm good with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very decisive person so this is</v>

39
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>probably one of them that I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it a little bit,</v>

40
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like how to be done or,</v>

41
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>or if to be done I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

42
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was the hardest part.</v>

43
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 2>My agent kept calling and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about this and what if you did</v>

44
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

45
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

46
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all need to get ready for me to be</v>

47
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 2>done please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

48
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then he came up with the,</v>

49
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you finish up at the,</v>

50
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 2>at Daytona for the 500?</v>

51
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the indy 500?</v>

52
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>He goes and I was really only referring</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the indy 500 and he was like,</v>

53
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 2>well I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love you to do both.</v>

54
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

55
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 2>well that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

56
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing in racing called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>double,</v>

57
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:05.551
<v Speaker 2>which is doing the indy 500 on Memorial</v>
<v Speaker 2>Day weekend on Sunday and then flying</v>

58
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>straight to charlotte to do the coke 600</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and that's kind of known as</v>

59
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>the double,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but this is what we're calling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danica double and it has to do with just</v>

61
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.470
<v Speaker 2>having spent a chunk of my career in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indycar and a chunk of my career in</v>

62
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 2>Nascar and it just kinda feels like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right way to go out.</v>

63
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't,</v>

64
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit of a murky end as far as</v>

65
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 2>like what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I going to race next year full time</v>

66
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just kind of went suit too long</v>

67
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 2>for me to have like a proper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm done sort of moment in my head.</v>

68
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.500
<v Speaker 2>So this was just a great way to do it.</v>

69
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that things happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

70
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that didn't happen before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what do you mean?</v>

71
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I got a sponsor leave me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My primary sponsor left at the beginning</v>

72
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 2>of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

73
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I signed a contract and when Mercury's</v>
<v Speaker 2>in retrograde so,</v>

74
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I screwed myself there,</v>

75
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

76
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was true.</v>

77
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

78
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe the universe is a little</v>

79
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>bit more straightforward</v>

80
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>than we think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of good things probably happened</v>

81
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 3>during that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just in 2017 or during retrograde</v>

82
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 3>mercury in retrograde.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in any of that shit.</v>

83
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people look for some sort of</v>

84
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 3>like hidden meaning to things when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to like astrology.</v>

85
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I do try and understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite,</v>

87
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to understand how it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>

88
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some things,</v>

89
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 2>at least with the moon that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the water changes with the moon,</v>

90
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:34.970
<v Speaker 2>so doesn't that mean that other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>should to whether it be energetically or</v>

91
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:35.810
<v Speaker 2>something like that?</v>

92
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I think the the water and the moon thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of makes sense a little bit,</v>

93
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's probably just like</v>

94
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.190
<v Speaker 3>barely one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a whisper on the wind kind of</v>

95
00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more in your head,</v>

96
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.870
<v Speaker 3>so stop putting my crystals outside to</v>
<v Speaker 3>charge under the full moon.</v>

97
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's not that important to</v>

98
00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:56.360
<v Speaker 3>do some something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone sent me about the army using</v>

99
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.270
<v Speaker 3>crystals and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has got to be like an onion article</v>

100
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 3>that the army,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the army was using crystals for like</v>

101
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 3>medic seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think if you could see it.</v>

102
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just the wounded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

104
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Look at this stupid shit I don't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

105
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if it's real,</v>

106
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 3>US Army's new holistic medics treating</v>
<v Speaker 3>gunshot wounds with crystals and</v>

107
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 3>essential oils is satire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

108
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew essential oils,</v>

109
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 3>don't you think there's a plant that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cures everything out there?</v>

110
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 3>There probably is something like that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon.</v>

111
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not cures everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's probably a lot of stuff that</v>

112
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 3>we come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

113
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 3>So pair that up with some high</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrational stones,</v>

114
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
<v Speaker 3>high vibrational stones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo tense.</v>

115
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 3>So I'm back to back to my sponsor</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving your sponsor,</v>

116
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.863
<v Speaker 3>leaving you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>

117
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

118
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just a never happened to me before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been someone that's been</v>

119
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>really well funded and always had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsor,</v>

120
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>always had a sponsor and never a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

121
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just things like that were</v>

123
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got into a few big wrecks in a row,</v>

124
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 2>like probably three and six weeks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

125
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was bawling in the medical center</v>

126
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>after the third one going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was running like a top 10 and a</v>

127
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 2>car blew a rotor and clipped me and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>me in the wall.</v>

128
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another driver broke his back.</v>

129
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a huge accident and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

130
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the message?</v>

131
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>What is someone trying to tell me right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

132
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>after I collected my shit and got my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face looking like halfway decent to go</v>

134
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 2>talk to the media out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally got out.</v>

135
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stuff like that was happening and I</v>

136
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a very go with the flow mood in</v>

137
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't pushing for anything because I</v>

138
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 2>wasn't really sure what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just let the universe take care of</v>

139
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

140
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.810
<v Speaker 3>You've got a very interesting way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things.</v>

141
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 3>You when things go wrong and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

142
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 3>what is the universe trying to tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like,</v>

143
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.380
<v Speaker 3>well I drive really fucking fast for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>living at.</v>

144
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes shit goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happens to it seems like</v>

145
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>car racing is just inherently crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I was saying when I</v>

146
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>was saying you do one of the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you can for a living going 240</v>

147
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:10.361
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour is no joke and metal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber and things just.</v>

148
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust in something when you're out there</v>

149
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

150
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.800
<v Speaker 2>200 plus miles an hour with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.030
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't your friends around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you with walls around you as well.</v>

152
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of got to put your trust in</v>

153
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:25.504
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

154
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was getting at that because</v>

155
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you think is the a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar to the way fighter</v>

156
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>pilots think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighter pilots have a lot of weird</v>

157
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>superstitions and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pilots do,</v>

158
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense things.</v>

159
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:44.411
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like in order to get through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the task at hand,</v>

160
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you almost have to delegate certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of reality to,</v>

161
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.890
<v Speaker 1>to fate or to chance or to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

162
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a tattoo on my back,</v>

165
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 2>one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an American flag.</v>

166
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I got that when I was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an American flag that fades to</v>

167
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:04.170
<v Speaker 2>a checkered flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a.</v>

168
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and then I got that when I was 19 when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was about 27,</v>

169
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I went and got the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was angel wings and some stars.</v>

170
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not the most beautiful piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

172
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 2>but it means something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be really beautiful in 30</v>

173
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.440
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure 40.</v>

174
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

175
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:22.481
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

176
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>

177
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>is that I would definitely pray that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I was taken care of and you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand that off and just go do your damn</v>

179
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 2>job and not be afraid and just trust in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fate of everything.</v>

180
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of where the angel wings.</v>

181
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people that do inherently</v>

182
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.361
<v Speaker 1>risky things oftentimes look for signs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or look for some sort of,</v>

183
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some direction,</v>

184
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>some message from the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I was.</v>

185
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

186
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as a race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this a lot lately and</v>

187
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:58.321
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much of our job is a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>less even just feeling what's happening</v>

188
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>and how much is actually maybe more</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive.</v>

189
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're having more intuitive</v>

190
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what's going on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's coming.</v>

191
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:12.421
<v Speaker 2>Then we realized we just are so um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's happening so fast and that</v>

192
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

193
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.671
<v Speaker 2>you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have really good feel.</v>

195
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

196
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's some of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

197
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 2>so I think that maybe maybe you're maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe athletes or people at an elite</v>

198
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 2>level are more in touch with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive side,</v>

199
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>that finite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like last thread of feel.</v>

200
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's beyond feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a knowing</v>

201
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

202
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've spent involved in that</v>

203
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>intense activity in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 1>they say that people get road rage for</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why people get road</v>

205
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:52.771
<v Speaker 1>rage is because when you're driving you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are reacting to things that could happen</v>

206
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your at a very heightened state and</v>

207
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>people know someone cuts you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start freaking out,</v>

208
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>like instantly they go from one to 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away and the reason is because</v>

209
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>they're always at seven and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even realize they're at seven.</v>

210
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>When you were in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your probably at like 13,</v>

211
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 2>this one goes to 11.</v>

212
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean your cranked up?</v>

213
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're probably seeing things and</v>

214
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>feeling things that the average person</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't experience in their life.</v>

215
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just working at that top little top</v>

216
00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:30.341
<v Speaker 2>level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of,</v>

217
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.280
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of focus.</v>

218
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Was that a dictate where you call in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone where it kind of almost become</v>

219
00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 2>slightly out of body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know how it's happening.</v>

220
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:42.214
<v Speaker 2>It's just happening.</v>

221
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine like you kind of melt</v>

222
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>away and you're just.</v>

223
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally involved task.</v>

224
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.980
<v Speaker 2>When I think about what I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say as an example,</v>

225
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>coming in for a pit stop and you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>your throttle brake,</v>

226
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.350
<v Speaker 2>clutch gears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things that you have</v>

227
00:09:56.351 --> 00:10:00.490
<v Speaker 2>to do to think about it logically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you have to do is so much more</v>

228
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 2>confusing than just going on instinct of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just do it</v>

229
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Speaker 2>because you have to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only have two feet,</v>

230
00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but you have three pedals and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use all three pedals at some point in</v>

231
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to be ready for everything</v>

232
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming in like with the clutch in</v>

233
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:18.070
<v Speaker 2>on the break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to get back to the get</v>

234
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:19.870
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the throttle just in time,</v>

235
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 2>but you have to have the clutch in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to hold the brake so you make</v>

236
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:24.130
<v Speaker 2>sure you don't roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of things you have to</v>

237
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:26.860
<v Speaker 2>do using all three pedals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have two feet and so when you</v>

238
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:28.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to think about what you</v>

239
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:29.980
<v Speaker 2>have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more overwhelming than</v>

240
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:32.440
<v Speaker 2>just doing it to drive a manual in real</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

241
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

242
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

243
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:35.604
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

244
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean a lot of people,</v>

245
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's kind of a dying</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

246
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

247
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean even indy cars went to paddle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting before I was done,</v>

248
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 2>it was h pattern and then it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequential gearbox and then it was</v>

249
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 2>paddle shifting and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Nascar,</v>

250
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Nascar still still got the old h</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

251
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>That left leg is important for the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel of the thing.</v>

252
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well especially in an indy car,</v>

253
00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 2>in any car you actually have a full on</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead pedal,</v>

254
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 2>so you have all three pedals and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a dead pedal,</v>

255
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 2>which is important because you spend a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of time with your foot there,</v>

256
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but it is part of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely part of the feel of the</v>

257
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with all the g loads.</v>

258
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>How did you get involved in racing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I raced go karts when I was a kid.</v>

259
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>My sister and my sister wanted to race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go carts and I just didn't want to get</v>

260
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>left out so it turned out I was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

261
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:23.020
<v Speaker 2>It and I kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

262
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a very unusual path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

263
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did everything though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a played like coach pitch.</v>

264
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Then tee ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the band,</v>

265
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>the choir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took voice lessons.</v>

266
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played basketball,</v>

267
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:37.530
<v Speaker 2>volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheerleading.</v>

268
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played in every sport.</v>

269
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took tumbling classes and then I also</v>

270
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>tried racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've always been intense?</v>

271
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

272
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.814
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

273
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you know at a certain age that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be a race car driver?</v>

274
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 10 I decided that I wanted to</v>

275
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 2>go to college for engineering so I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to work on my race car and I</v>

276
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:00.390
<v Speaker 2>realized I did not have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not have it.</v>

277
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought I did.</v>

278
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to do that.</v>

279
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Be An engineer so that you could work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your race card,</v>

280
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand how crazy that is?</v>

281
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.250
<v Speaker 2>When I was 10 years old to three</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that,</v>

282
00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:11.084
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

283
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

284
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you're born that way or am</v>
<v Speaker 2>I an old,</v>

285
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>like what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to be thinking that way when I'm 10</v>

286
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

287
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 2>some people are just so much different</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more mature further along.</v>

288
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

289
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's entirely possible</v>

290
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that memory gets transferred through DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there are certain people that</v>

291
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 1>have a long line of adventurous people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their family and that gets</v>

292
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>transferred to the DNA of the children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible.</v>

293
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

294
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I have three children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a spiritual reincarnation.</v>

295
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.690
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

296
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

297
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 1>that's entirely possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never.</v>

298
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I would never say no to that because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living this life,</v>

299
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean nobody asked to live this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just here.</v>

300
00:13:00.291 --> 00:13:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you get to do it again,</v>

301
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're assuming that you don't get to do</v>

302
00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:08.450
<v Speaker 1>it again because we're assuming that</v>
<v Speaker 1>time goes on this sort of linear way,</v>

303
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.610
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it just does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you in this life,</v>

304
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of lives being lived out</v>

305
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.140
<v Speaker 1>in infinite timelines all</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

306
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.020
<v Speaker 1>We're just experiencing this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what happens when we</v>

307
00:13:21.021 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to sleep,</v>

308
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes if some crazy dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>about godzilla chase.</v>

309
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyone you're on a skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning and you just</v>

310
00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:31.490
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're on the same timeline</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were on before,</v>

311
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to astral.</v>

312
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

313
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I have children and in one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really fascinating about watching</v>

314
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:42.990
<v Speaker 1>a child develop from a baby to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:45.350
<v Speaker 1>a kid and see their personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize,</v>

316
00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of stuff that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they come with.</v>

317
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just different.</v>

318
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>They're just different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

319
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.183
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

320
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>why was I thinking about being an</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineer when I was 10 years old?</v>

321
00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Why was I brave enough to go live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>England by myself when I was 16 and all</v>

322
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>good with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

323
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.920
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

324
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I intent?</v>

325
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was I intense when you met me?</v>

326
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

327
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of your intensity is</v>

328
00:14:12.081 --> 00:14:14.210
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>

329
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 1>if I could be presumptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a woman involved in a very manly</v>

330
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:23.891
<v Speaker 1>activity and I'm sure men probably test</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in some sort of a weird way and so I</v>

331
00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:29.601
<v Speaker 1>bet along the way you've developed this</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of way of addressing them right</v>

332
00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:31.880
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a listen motherfucker</v>

333
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.430
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just like.</v>

334
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think you probably have to,</v>

335
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

336
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

337
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>to be strong you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was younger and going</v>

338
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 2>to meetings with companies or team</v>
<v Speaker 2>bosses,</v>

339
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 2>people like that and was the advice</v>
<v Speaker 2>given was don't say,</v>

340
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh I the sun maybe like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be sure about what you want.</v>

341
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.370
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

342
00:14:56.371 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 2>a nature versus nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's learned,</v>

343
00:14:58.311 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 2>but some of it's just there.</v>

344
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't turn a timid person into you.</v>

345
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's not,</v>

346
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 3>not likely you would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You seem to be like this person.</v>

347
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 3>This is just who you are and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that at 10 years old you were</v>

348
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 3>thinking about being an engineer so he</v>
<v Speaker 3>could work on race cars.</v>

349
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>That's not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's normal though?</v>

350
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 3>What'd you want to do when you were 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old?</v>

351
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably wanted to be an artist.</v>

352
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.010
<v Speaker 3>I think I want it to be an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

353
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 3>that follows this vein sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

354
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 3>But I used to want to draw comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of that.</v>

355
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was probably what I wanted,</v>

356
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 3>but I was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I need to do is like,</v>

357
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I need to figure out a way to make my</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand stronger so that faster you see</v>

358
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Steven mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not go to college.</v>

359
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 2>In fact I didn't even finish high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

360
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>You didn't at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

361
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I left when I was 16 and I got my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

362
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I failed the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

363
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>You want to know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

364
00:15:53.331 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's like a horrible,</v>

365
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>like I failed my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

366
00:15:58.281 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

367
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution test is something,</v>

368
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 2>at least in Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have to pass it in</v>

369
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 2>every state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Illinois you do.</v>

370
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.730
<v Speaker 2>And so in eighth grade to go to high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school you have to get a 70 percent or</v>

371
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 2>above to go to high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a 70,</v>

372
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>so I went to high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like a three point five and</v>

373
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 2>above student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was a's and b's not a problem for</v>

374
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The constitution and government and all</v>

375
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 2>of those sectors and names and holy</v>
<v Speaker 2>moly,</v>

376
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 2>it's so confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

377
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then when it came time to do my take</v>

378
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 2>my ged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't study at all.</v>

379
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:38.000

<v Speaker 2>constitution test.</v>

380
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 2>So prepare for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

381
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never studied in my life so I just</v>

383
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.383
<v Speaker 2>think no,</v>

384
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.400
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that I have my talking points ready.</v>

389
00:17:00.361 --> 00:17:03.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent 15 minutes or 30 minutes or five</v>

390
00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:07.290
<v Speaker 2>minutes making sure that I'm organized</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my head about what it is that I need</v>

391
00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:10.800
<v Speaker 2>to get out there so that I can do my job</v>
<v Speaker 2>and deliver.</v>

392
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.350

430
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was talking about signing my</v>

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 2>contract and when Mercury's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>retrograde,</v>

432
00:18:35.541 --> 00:18:38.000
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to an astrologer and she said,</v>

433
00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:39.830
<v Speaker 2>just don't sign any contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

434
00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:41.360
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a bizarre.</v>

435
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was kind of learning about some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff because it was quite a few</v>

436
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.950
<v Speaker 2>years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

437
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.873
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

438
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.630
<v Speaker 2>I remember the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half later or so,</v>

439
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit hit the fan and I was like,</v>

440
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that damn astrologer was right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

441
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.640
<v Speaker 2>mercury in retrograde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty standard information if</v>

442
00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:00.680
<v Speaker 2>you're in astrology at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

443
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.750
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

444
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I saw a psychic in Sedona a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and she said that professionally</v>

445
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.710

<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

448
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:11.180
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

449
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win a bunch of races,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be awesome.</v>

450
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:15.160
<v Speaker 2>And instead I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

451
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a clothing line now I have a book</v>

452
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:22.190
<v Speaker 2>that just came out at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year,</v>

453
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.280
<v Speaker 2>my wines finally been for sale for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year now.</v>

454
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.800
<v Speaker 2>And there's other projects I'm working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on too,</v>

455
00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:28.634
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

456
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

457
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 2>finishing off my career in a pretty big</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

458
00:19:31.641 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 2>So I guess she was right.</v>

459
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that lady's full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

460
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I think she looked at you and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chick's gonna kick ass.</v>

461
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll.</v>

462
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Somebody thinks she recognized me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then she's like,</v>

463
00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:42.110
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I sat down she was like,</v>

464
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.600
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it works here is like I just see</v>

465
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:49.310
<v Speaker 2>words or symbols or things around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I just look around like don't</v>

466
00:19:49.311 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 2>think I'm not paying attention to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how I see things.</v>

467
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:52.664
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

468
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there and she's telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff and she says whatever my</v>

469
00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:58.430
<v Speaker 2>job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I travel a lot and things like that.</v>

470
00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And then she all of a sudden kind of was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at me.</v>

471
00:20:00.351 --> 00:20:01.130
<v Speaker 2>She'll go over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

472
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.620
<v Speaker 2>celebrity are you a celebrity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

473
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I only am if you think I am just usually</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I answer people.</v>

474
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

475
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.800
<v Speaker 2>Did she know who I was up in Sedona?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't watch a lot of TV.</v>

476
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>

477
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.030
<v Speaker 2>They sneak</v>

478
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.090
<v Speaker 3>it in when no one's looking their lunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>break areas.</v>

479
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Just the arrest their crystals on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV.</v>

480
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I just think he's sending positive vibes</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all bullshit.</v>

481
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.920
<v Speaker 3>I think almost all psychic stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>

482
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:35.000
<v Speaker 3>I think you don't believe in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being intuitive into intuition is a</v>

483
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:37.220
<v Speaker 3>different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when people sit down,</v>

484
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.830
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see you in a past life and you are</v>

485
00:20:39.831 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 3>handmade and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

486
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.100
<v Speaker 3>you worked by the river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

487
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.470
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all bullshit.</v>

488
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I think those people are nuts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot</v>

489
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>of people that want to think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>special and they want to think they have</v>

490
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>special gifts in there and people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at reading people.</v>

491
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:59.431
<v Speaker 1>I know people who are professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>magicians and they are expert cold</v>

492
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could sit down with you and breed</v>

493
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and tell you remarkable amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with your about your life,</v>

494
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Speaker 1>just with your answers to questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll tell you right away.</v>

495
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>They're not psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a guy named bandit check</v>

496
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 1>who's excellent at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>

497
00:21:12.641 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 1>He does a show in Vegas and he freaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out because they'll tell you</v>

498
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not a psychic.</v>

499
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is A.</v>

500
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 1>There's techniques to this and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I've been doing my whole life</v>

501
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 1>and you just get really good at it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to do it and these people</v>

502
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>are con artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're they're con artists.</v>

503
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.740
<v Speaker 1>They trick you into thinking that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

504
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but they might even believe it</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

505
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people can themselves,</v>

506
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is something like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about someone and they</v>

507
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.650
<v Speaker 1>call you like out of nowhere and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't told me</v>

508
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.230
<v Speaker 2>the prevalence of synchronicities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop up in your life and you're like,</v>

509
00:21:43.231 --> 00:21:44.630
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that movie and</v>

510
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 2>there it is on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

511
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bizarre connection that we don't</v>

512
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.910
<v Speaker 1>totally understand to events into people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into things</v>

513
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.580
<v Speaker 2>well like attracts like or where</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention goes.</v>

514
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Energy flows.</v>

515
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot to that.</v>

516
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Certain magnetism to those two things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bring it together.</v>

517
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.103
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

518
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poorly understood and there's a lot</v>

519
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 1>of woo that's clouding it up in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wound gets in the way of rational,</v>

520
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated people.</v>

521
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Even considering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dismiss it instantaneously because</v>

522
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 1>it's connected to so many assholes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>neon signs.</v>

523
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a card reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>palm reader,</v>

524
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and these people that just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just ripping you off.</v>

525
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 1>That's all they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a real job.</v>

526
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk to people for a job and you</v>

527
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 1>know you could say it's entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could say that what they're doing is</v>

528
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:39.520
<v Speaker 1>they're providing you with a service and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that service.</v>

529
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 1>They sit down with you and and maybe by</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you that everything's going to</v>

530
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:45.340
<v Speaker 1>be amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll walk out of there with a lot of</v>

531
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and then life will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

532
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

533
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think your life's going to be</v>

534
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:50.794
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be.</v>

535
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

536
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:54.390
<v Speaker 1>You get hit by a meteor kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

537
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You could fall into a crack in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground from an earthquake.</v>

538
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean those people that died in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tsunami in Thailand,</v>

539
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.490
<v Speaker 1>were they bad people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

540
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Is there any level of woo that's worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>following through on?</v>

541
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

542
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 1>it's all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some.</v>

543
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Some of the connections and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition and some superstitions and</v>

544
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we have are probably based in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this limited understanding that we have</v>

545
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.370
<v Speaker 1>in the connection that we have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>events and humans in life,</v>

546
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's also bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved too and all these things get</v>

547
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>very cloudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's an absolute,</v>

548
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition is a developing sense that we</v>

549
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>don't totally have yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you think about all the</v>

550
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 1>things that people can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing and seeing and touching and</v>

551
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 1>smelling all the different senses that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

552
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 1>we assume that that covers the full</v>
<v Speaker 1>gamut of possibilities,</v>

553
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's true.</v>

554
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

555
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Visually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

556
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.800
<v Speaker 2>we don't see the full spectrum of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see a very,</v>

557
00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:59.440
<v Speaker 2>very small amount of things that are out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

558
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our audio is wall.</v>

559
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can hear all the sounds.</v>

560
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's entirely possible that</v>

561
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:07.300
<v Speaker 1>there's more going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain people that just</v>

562
00:24:07.301 --> 00:24:10.530
<v Speaker 1>have a weird feel to them immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like scale you got get a from this guy.</v>

563
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely people that they're</v>

564
00:24:13.031 --> 00:24:18.031
<v Speaker 1>giving off weird feelings and it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that your reading their intent and</v>

565
00:24:18.151 --> 00:24:21.940
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a way that you don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>visually,</v>

566
00:24:21.941 --> 00:24:25.480
<v Speaker 1>but you recognized by their body</v>
<v Speaker 1>language or it could be a bunch of</v>

567
00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Well he didn't run when you met me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I appreciate that.</v>

569
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Now we're probably scheduled to do this</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview,</v>

570
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:30.930
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

571
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.910
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking forward to this.</v>

572
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Why would I run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>

573
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed by your intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I expected that in a way.</v>

574
00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how you could be a race car</v>

575
00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:44.280
<v Speaker 1>driver and not being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially being a woman in a race car</v>

576
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:45.370
<v Speaker 1>driver and not be in touch.</v>

577
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.200
<v Speaker 2>So that's nothing I even thought about</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I was like 14.</v>

578
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first few days,</v>

579
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.290
<v Speaker 2>abrasive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way late in life,</v>

580
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I think about being a girl out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until I had cameras following</v>

581
00:24:56.551 --> 00:24:58.860
<v Speaker 2>me around my schools and stuff that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

582
00:24:58.861 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is.</v>

583
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.560
<v Speaker 2>And then they start asking you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

584
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:02.820
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to be a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

585
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And originally I don't know really,</v>

586
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

587
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.840
<v Speaker 2>how many other girls do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are various girls here and</v>

588
00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

589
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of Nascar.</v>

590
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 1>How many women are right or racing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

591
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not zero man.</v>

592
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.880
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

593
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

594
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

595
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it from me.</v>

596
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask you what's it like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a girl in racing?</v>

597
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:26.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>

598
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 2>well I don't really know what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a guy.</v>

599
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I only have my perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>

601
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:33.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

602
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't like being a girl versus a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

603
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it like to be a guy?</v>

604
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably be different,</v>

605
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but I think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it like to be a woman that's the</v>

606
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:49.220
<v Speaker 1>only woman who's in Nascar at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>level?</v>

607
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a valid question.</v>

608
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

609
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>How does everybody else treat you?</v>

610
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

611
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really is the main question I can't</v>

612
00:25:57.171 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 2>answer because I'm not them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

613
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

614
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.960
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it enough experience now because I</v>

615
00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:05.480
<v Speaker 2>used to not really look into it much in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

616
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 2>in the indycar days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't hit each other,</v>

617
00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:09.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

618
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:10.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you could block and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were some guys out there that</v>

620
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:14.960
<v Speaker 2>were assholes and I didn't like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

621
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes every driver has some drive,</v>

622
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>some other drivers that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really get along with.</v>

623
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Nascar you can hit each other and</v>

624
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it's bumpers and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really cool,</v>

625
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>but it also isn't cool because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody wants to do what they can.</v>

626
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 2>So what would I say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that they don't want to get</v>

627
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 2>passed by a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

628
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that weird?</v>

629
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

630
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've driven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've raced with girls and I don't,</v>

631
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.443
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

632
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

633
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>do you feel differently when a</v>

634
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 3>guy passes you then when a girl passes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

635
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

636
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.010
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go internally that bitch.</v>

637
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.123
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

638
00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.120
<v Speaker 4>can't believe my car isn't faster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

639
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.770
<v Speaker 4>This</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens?</v>

640
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.770
<v Speaker 4>The guy that passed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good or not good that I'm like,</v>

641
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on the radio and I'd be like,</v>

642
00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.351
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

643
00:27:05.351 --> 00:27:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I just want you to see that what car</v>
<v Speaker 4>passed me and how bad my car is out now.</v>

644
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Right now I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it happens with guys too,</v>

645
00:27:12.551 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

646
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.640
<v Speaker 4>It's just a cultural norm that girls</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't good and allow,</v>

647
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't very good and that they,</v>

648
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 4>they somewhat don't belong and I get</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the little bit of animosity at</v>

649
00:27:26.081 --> 00:27:27.940
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would have thought that people</v>

650
00:27:27.941 --> 00:27:29.950
<v Speaker 4>would have got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got used to it a little bit more than</v>

651
00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:31.600
<v Speaker 4>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

652
00:27:31.601 --> 00:27:34.390
<v Speaker 4>But you have that cultural animosity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were saying a little bit.</v>

653
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

654
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you say that it's a,</v>

655
00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:40.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a cultural norm that girls aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

656
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't think about that about</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

657
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.310
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

658
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.410
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that you don't have any doubts.</v>

659
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.251
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

660
00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:47.061
<v Speaker 4>Everyone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

661
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:50.060
<v Speaker 4>you suck because of this and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to beat you because of that.</v>

662
00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:51.950
<v Speaker 4>And Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate you.</v>

663
00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:54.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think because I'm a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not as good as.</v>

664
00:27:54.501 --> 00:27:55.221
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

665
00:27:55.221 --> 00:27:56.810
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why would you think that about the</v>

666
00:27:56.811 --> 00:27:59.510
<v Speaker 4>other grades?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just I'm not used to it.</v>

667
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just something you're not used to.</v>

668
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

669
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well also it's like you're unique.</v>

670
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you were out there in the gym</v>

671
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 4>and some girl comes and picks up more</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight than you and you're like,</v>

672
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird that on roids she probably</v>

673
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Amazon freak,</v>

674
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.840
<v Speaker 3>some genetic freak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to sign her,</v>

675
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 3>bring her to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

676
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.760
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.530
<v Speaker 3>throw a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

678
00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all have cultural prejudices</v>

679
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Speaker 3>to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether we admit it or not.</v>

680
00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.270
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're not a big it,</v>

681
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're just maybe just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>reservations and you're pleasantly</v>

682
00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:37.510
<v Speaker 3>surprised when people surpass those</v>
<v Speaker 3>expectations,</v>

683
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would think that you would</v>

684
00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:45.601
<v Speaker 3>experience probably more discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a woman then.</v>

685
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about a woman doing almost</v>

686
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.050
<v Speaker 3>any other job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're telling me you're the</v>

687
00:28:53.051 --> 00:28:58.051
<v Speaker 3>only woman that does that and you're at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this intense macho job,</v>

688
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.810
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking intense job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

689
00:29:01.811 --> 00:29:06.811
<v Speaker 3>you'd go on to 100 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's nuts.</v>

690
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.720
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're out there at the top of the</v>

691
00:29:10.721 --> 00:29:12.850
<v Speaker 3>food chain with all these men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

692
00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.700
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there's two things that</v>

693
00:29:15.701 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of guys that treat you</v>

694
00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:19.750
<v Speaker 3>with respect there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

695
00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:21.340
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really compressed.</v>

696
00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.170
<v Speaker 3>They're cool with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

697
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.410
<v Speaker 3>she's one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a few that are just</v>

698
00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:29.560
<v Speaker 3>dicks and the those decks are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>encourageable</v>

699
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.080
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of times I wish I was good at</v>

700
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:36.690
<v Speaker 4>taking people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish people knew how hard it was to</v>

701
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 4>actually take someone out on track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that easy.</v>

702
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You would because you can risk taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

703
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

704
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if your car doesn't handle very</v>

705
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't get close enough to him.</v>

706
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would just move the air,</v>

707
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 4>which is almost like hitting him and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>him out of the way,</v>

708
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes the car doesn't handle</v>
<v Speaker 4>well enough so like you'd have to just</v>

709
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 4>bomb in there and God willing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit them to get you to slow down and</v>

710
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 4>then they go sailing and you keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's risk.</v>

711
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a rare moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

712
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you done it before?</v>

713
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Where I've tried to take people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suck at it.</v>

714
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:11.920
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely suck at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've taken myself out like three times</v>

715
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 4>trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

716
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be the lamb.</v>

717
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind it to make a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make a point if someone's</v>

718
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:20.630
<v Speaker 4>driving like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

719
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.200
<v Speaker 2>So what was the one that was the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad was,</v>

720
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:26.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

721
00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 2>it was a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a Martinsville and this was when</v>

722
00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:34.350
<v Speaker 2>something was going down with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano and</v>

723
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:37.080
<v Speaker 2>it was during the chase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the last 10 races of the</v>

724
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:39.210
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were in the chase.</v>

725
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Matt and Joey and Joey had made it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Matt couldn't get in because he</v>

726
00:30:43.651 --> 00:30:46.080
<v Speaker 2>took them out a week earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week or two earlier and then they got</v>

727
00:30:46.081 --> 00:30:48.180
<v Speaker 2>to Martinsville and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small short track.</v>

728
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:50.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just a half a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>

729
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.520
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to kind of be able to attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>

730
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And so he just straight took them out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

731
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole big hoopla about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People up in arms thought it was totally</v>

732
00:31:01.771 --> 00:31:03.630
<v Speaker 2>unfair and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

733
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:06.840
<v Speaker 2>during the same race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some asshole hits me,</v>

734
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 2>takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spins me out and so I come back and I'm</v>

735
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 2>a lap down or something because he spins</v>
<v Speaker 2>me out and I go to take him out and I</v>

736
00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:16.710
<v Speaker 2>just say off into the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he manages to kind of keep going.</v>

737
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I spin again because I'm horrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

738
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.080
<v Speaker 2>turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

739
00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I get a $50,000 fine because I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

740
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racing for position because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a lap down and they applied that</v>

741
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.550
<v Speaker 2>because that was also the same race that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt and Joey had their big thing and I</v>

742
00:31:35.551 --> 00:31:38.050
<v Speaker 2>think maybe joey was leading or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

743
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I think he was leading and it was on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>restart.</v>

744
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So they weren't racing for position</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

745
00:31:42.301 --> 00:31:46.620
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of like their rule that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put forth to make for.</v>

746
00:31:46.621 --> 00:31:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

747
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Matt probably got 100 or $200,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

748
00:31:50.011 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Speaker 2>But I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not the,</v>

749
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely screwed in the scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got fined 50 grand for it and I'm</v>

750
00:31:57.241 --> 00:31:58.074
<v Speaker 2>the one that's out.</v>

751
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.500
<v Speaker 4>So if you're another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're racing for position,</v>

752
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 4>then it's okay to bump into each other</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>

753
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So really</v>

754
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you're the one that screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're racing,</v>

755
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.030
<v Speaker 2>if someone takes you out and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still racing for position now you're</v>

756
00:32:11.031 --> 00:32:13.470
<v Speaker 2>going to have to be potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.400
<v Speaker 2>putting yourself in another position to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get taken out when they started it.</v>

758
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a no win for the person that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>being aggressed that the aggressive.</v>

759
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.790
<v Speaker 4>Was it always legal to bump into each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other?</v>

761
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gone kind of through waves of</v>

762
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:29.380
<v Speaker 4>different rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

763
00:32:29.381 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean it is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when,</v>

764
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.220
<v Speaker 4>whenever a big accident happens and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a tragedy,</v>

765
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 4>I would assume that that's when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>tightened down the rules sometimes.</v>

766
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes.</v>

767
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes just accept</v>

768
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just usually if there's</v>

769
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 2>something like that that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not from one person's action that</v>

770
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe a chain of events that leads</v>
<v Speaker 2>to something like that.</v>

771
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the rare jobs that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sport.</v>

772
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.430
<v Speaker 1>One of the rare sports where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for death is always there.</v>

773
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

774
00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.913
<v Speaker 2>It is true.</v>

775
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the reasons why you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided</v>

776
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.280
<v Speaker 2>not a daredevil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I am not a daredevil.</v>

777
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I went bungee jumping and that is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bravest thing I've ever done otherwise.</v>

778
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And I only did it because I'm afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>heights,</v>

779
00:33:11.731 --> 00:33:14.280
<v Speaker 2>so I just needed to know that if I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conquer a fear,</v>

780
00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

781
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.910
<v Speaker 2>what's your definition of a daredevil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brake controller?</v>

782
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.560
<v Speaker 2>You could potentially get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not though.</v>

783
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.940
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

784
00:33:23.941 --> 00:33:27.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're a race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a methodical driver,</v>

785
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.160
<v Speaker 2>a methodical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go out there and just,</v>

786
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold it wide open until the car does</v>

787
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:34.330
<v Speaker 2>something and then I'm like up better</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift now I'm like,</v>

788
00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm methodical driver so I build up what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're saying is you're not</v>

789
00:33:37.651 --> 00:33:41.160
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's very nice of you.</v>

790
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:44.580
<v Speaker 2>That's like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice way to say that.</v>

791
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not dumb,</v>

792
00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but you're definitely a daredevil.</v>

793
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.151
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

794
00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you could not be.</v>

795
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>

796
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Really knows me knows that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>brave.</v>

797
00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

798
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're talking crazy.</v>

799
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Talk over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

800
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

801
00:34:04.231 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had been grooming this talent</v>

802
00:34:06.451 --> 00:34:10.710
<v Speaker 2>since I was 10 and 26 years later I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with it.</v>

803
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's no doubt that you're</v>

804
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.510
<v Speaker 1>a brave person.</v>

805
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Actually my first time in a go kart was</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

806
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 2>What you your three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten,</v>

807
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my sister was eight.</v>

808
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.730
<v Speaker 2>My Dad built the go carts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big parking lot out back.</v>

809
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So we got like spray cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wd for whatever,</v>

810
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 2>pop cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

811
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:31.881
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

812
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so pop and set them up in a big circle</v>

813
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:37.740
<v Speaker 2>for my sister and I to go out and drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

814
00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:43.110
<v Speaker 2>drive our go carts for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my dad made there was the little</v>

815
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 2>mistake with the brake pedal and so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped working and since I'm 10 and I'm</v>

816
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.930
<v Speaker 2>really young and dumb and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing.</v>

817
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb and broke.</v>

818
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:53.324
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

819
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 2>like the song goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

820
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.110
<v Speaker 2>but I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to hit the break,</v>

821
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead of just spinning out or</v>

822
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:02.090
<v Speaker 2>continuing to turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went straight and I was headed</v>

823
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:06.890
<v Speaker 2>for a trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of a higher elevated trailer</v>

824
00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>which would have resulted in</v>
<v Speaker 2>decapitation.</v>

825
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And I swerved at the last second and hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concrete wall and I like go flying and</v>

826
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 2>my arm lays back on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the muffler and my cool puffy jacket,</v>

827
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Burns and bruises all up my legs and on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arms.</v>

828
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my first time in a go kart</v>

829
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.940
<v Speaker 2>five or 10 minutes of being out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my dad just got a new one and</v>

831
00:35:28.941 --> 00:35:32.180
<v Speaker 2>built it and we went racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I am really brave.</v>

832
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

833
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like an indy car to some</v>

834
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't brave because people were</v>

835
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 2>willing to do things that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceivably more brave.</v>

836
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did describe them as dumb.</v>

837
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.110
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're probably a little right.</v>

838
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And I'm maybe a little right too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

839
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I think you definitely brave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's definitely a line</v>

840
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:56.750
<v Speaker 3>where bravery become stupid because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>risk outweighs the reward 100 percent,</v>

841
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.670
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a masculine thing in a lot of ways</v>

842
00:35:59.671 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 3>because it's testosterone makes you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>really stupid shit.</v>

843
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.291
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

844
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 3>they're all competing against each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the trend out macho each other.</v>

845
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of twitter accounts so</v>

846
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:12.180
<v Speaker 3>you can go and see what's that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold this beer</v>

847
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.060
<v Speaker 3>is a twitter account called hold my beer</v>
<v Speaker 3>while was exactly why I do everything.</v>

848
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like people jumping off roofs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid shit and it's almost all men.</v>

849
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 3>There's occasionally a drunk girl doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something stupid,</v>

850
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:32.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost entirely men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would think that men trying to out</v>

851
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.240
<v Speaker 3>macho each other</v>

852
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.140
<v Speaker 2>somewhat inferior then because they do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of dumb stuff.</v>

853
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their hormones are not in balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ours.</v>

854
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.400
<v Speaker 3>They definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when competing against each other,</v>

855
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.140
<v Speaker 3>we'll do dumb shit and they trust around</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones to blame.</v>

856
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Will they try that out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Macho each other?</v>

857
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some don't.</v>

858
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 3>Some are smart and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

859
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:58.360
<v Speaker 3>there's just a part of being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like trying to prove that you're</v>

860
00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:00.790
<v Speaker 3>not scared as part of being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about men.</v>

861
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.903
<v Speaker 3>What you want to know</v>

862
00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.893
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else is.</v>

863
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 2>What else is a very manly that women</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand?</v>

864
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:08.784
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

865
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:09.591
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

866
00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:11.160
<v Speaker 2>what don't women understand about men?</v>

867
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what you understand about</v>

868
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just speak from experience.</v>

869
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

870
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we ask a guy like what's wrong,</v>

871
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.670
<v Speaker 3>see that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk.</v>

872
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Many girls out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honey,</v>

873
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:31.580
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong?</v>

874
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.130
<v Speaker 3>And you're like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's not really.</v>

875
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Is it really nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

876
00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just want me to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decompress.</v>

877
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it just wound up that annoying</v>

878
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.250
<v Speaker 3>when a girl does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That depends on the girl,</v>

879
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.480
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

880
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she's annoying,</v>

881
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:47.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying.</v>

882
00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:49.370
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in love with her and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome,</v>

883
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.190
<v Speaker 3>she can know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

884
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the right one.</v>

885
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

886
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.550
<v Speaker 3>That's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

887
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.600
<v Speaker 3>If someone's asking you questions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting really fucking annoyed,</v>

888
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.720
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more the person.</v>

889
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.140
<v Speaker 3>If you think someone's amazing and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask you something stupid,</v>

890
00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you'll just laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't get annoyed.</v>

891
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 3>And you guys could both joke around</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how stupid it was.</v>

892
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.070
<v Speaker 3>How the question was dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

893
00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.460
<v Speaker 3>If you get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's most likely you're just like</v>

894
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.873
<v Speaker 3>annoyed anyway.</v>

895
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just like ready to ready to</v>

896
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 2>ready to sort of fall over that annoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get out,</v>

897
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.180
<v Speaker 2>get out of my space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a attitude because you're</v>

898
00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:31.790
<v Speaker 2>already annoyed with them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're already don't really like them.</v>

899
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably something that's</v>

900
00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 3>already rubbing you the wrong way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're tolerating each other instead of</v>

901
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 3>enjoying each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

902
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would imagine a person like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

903
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 3>a very intense person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have a difficult time</v>

904
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

905
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 3>like if you got a square peg in a square</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole and everything slides in together.</v>

906
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything's amazing.</v>

907
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Personality wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Behavior wise,</v>

908
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine with something like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

909
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:00.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a very particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to find someone who appreciates</v>

910
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:03.130
<v Speaker 3>your intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

911
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of times guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want a demure,</v>

912
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of docile little creature like</v>

913
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:17.770
<v Speaker 3>me home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the suburbs on the table here when</v>

914
00:39:17.771 --> 00:39:20.020
<v Speaker 3>you get back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

915
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.040
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out there with a fucking gold car</v>

916
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:27.041
<v Speaker 3>going 150 miles an hour in the driveway</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's running five businesses.</v>

917
00:39:27.271 --> 00:39:28.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

918
00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:29.530
<v Speaker 3>You're going 200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

919
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.730
<v Speaker 3>So if you're saying what's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys are fucking nothing.</v>

920
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Probably a bunch of other shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really wrong.</v>

921
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.700
<v Speaker 3>It's very insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

922
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.520
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what don't men understand about women?</v>

923
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's tapping her fingers,</v>

924
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 3>going through everything.</v>

925
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that we'd like to be,</v>

926
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like to be told what you're thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 3>girlfriends when you get together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about.</v>

936
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

937
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you look at a guy and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this fucking dude.</v>

940
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Some crazy mystery like what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head,</v>

943
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to know where they stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what someone's thinking.</v>

944
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they stand and where they stand on</v>

945
00:40:32.411 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 2>what they're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know what if the thing about</v>

946
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:35.464
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>

947
00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need to know.</v>

948
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just didn't know if you're all in.</v>

949
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

950
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just all in person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's not a mystery like you</v>

951
00:40:45.031 --> 00:40:46.560
<v Speaker 2>wanna know what's going on in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you right now.</v>

952
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.530
<v Speaker 3>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

953
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

954
00:40:50.311 --> 00:40:52.920
<v Speaker 3>for guys like off drifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you automatically assume this one,</v>

955
00:40:52.921 --> 00:40:55.200
<v Speaker 3>the fockers thinking about somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

956
00:40:55.201 --> 00:40:56.034
<v Speaker 3>what are you up to?</v>

957
00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're thinking.</v>

958
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

959
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.970
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be able to ask.</v>

960
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I guess guys probably do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hear nice things to girls like to</v>

961
00:41:06.591 --> 00:41:07.041
<v Speaker 2>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:41:07.041 --> 00:41:08.360
<v Speaker 2>girls like to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:41:08.361 --> 00:41:13.361
<v Speaker 2>girls like course to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would be appreciated just like a guy</v>

964
00:41:13.491 --> 00:41:13.971
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

965
00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my advice most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in relationships.</v>

966
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy goes a really long way because</v>

967
00:41:18.621 --> 00:41:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I know it goes a long way with me no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what facet of my life it is,</v>

968
00:41:22.281 --> 00:41:24.380
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy goes a long way.</v>

969
00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:26.960
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your husband's in a bad mood,</v>

970
00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:29.540
<v Speaker 2>then why don't you just actually start</v>
<v Speaker 2>off with instead of feeling like you're</v>

971
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:31.280
<v Speaker 2>under appreciated going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey baby,</v>

972
00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 2>look like you've had a really long day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure been working your butt off.</v>

973
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I make you dinner?</v>

974
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your favorite?</v>

975
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll probably go,</v>

976
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what is not that not that big</v>

977
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.280
<v Speaker 2>of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

978
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:41.961
<v Speaker 2>Babe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

979
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me take you out to dinner.</v>

980
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I get to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sympathy gets sympathy back and you</v>

981
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.440
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

982
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 2>it's not good to do it to get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>

983
00:41:50.181 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 2>but you should really feel like you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic.</v>

984
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if they're in a bad place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and help him.</v>

985
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.800
<v Speaker 2>That's sound advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

986
00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.950
<v Speaker 2>just sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be nice because most people go</v>

987
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 2>under appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in a relationship.</v>

988
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I think the longer it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of under appreciation and</v>

989
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 2>assumptions that get made about who does</v>
<v Speaker 2>what and checks that box off and</v>

990
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.950
<v Speaker 2>probably especially with kids right</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts out here with kids it gets way</v>

991
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:13.710
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

992
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just there's a lot of time that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved with taking care of those</v>

993
00:42:17.071 --> 00:42:20.160
<v Speaker 3>little suckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta pay attention to them and talk</v>

994
00:42:20.161 --> 00:42:22.530
<v Speaker 3>to them and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have more than one,</v>

995
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.090
<v Speaker 3>like once you start talking to one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other one wants to just chime in and</v>

996
00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:28.320
<v Speaker 3>show you what they're doing.</v>

997
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't die now.</v>

998
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I gotta deal with this.</v>

999
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 3>I think people get used to things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1001
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get used to each other for</v>

1002
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.560
<v Speaker 3>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1003
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1004
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspire to be the person you pretend to</v>

1005
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 3>be when you're trying to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could be that person all the</v>

1006
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will have a much better life.</v>

1007
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I also love the expression for every hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick,</v>

1008
00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 2>there's the dude's sickest groner</v>

1009
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say it that way,</v>

1010
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.140
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use more flavorful language,</v>

1011
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

1012
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that too much or too little?</v>

1013
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Too Little?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you say it?</v>

1014
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for every hot chick,</v>

1015
00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:14.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy somewhere that's tired of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking honor.</v>

1016
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Sorry you'd say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1017
00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:21.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not entirely true either.</v>

1018
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the times it's true,</v>

1019
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.760
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the times people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate or circumstance.</v>

1020
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's with various aspects of</v>

1021
00:43:32.431 --> 00:43:33.600
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I always feel like that,</v>

1022
00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:36.780
<v Speaker 3>like I just got over the flu a week and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a half ago.</v>

1023
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:40.410
<v Speaker 3>I had the flu and I was sick for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days and then when I was sick I was</v>

1024
00:43:40.411 --> 00:43:41.244
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1025
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate how good I feel when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm healthy because here I am line here,</v>

1026
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.160
<v Speaker 3>akin watching Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling like shit going,</v>

1027
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm healthy and I'm working out and</v>

1028
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm running and doing Jujitsu and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the activities and I got all this energy</v>

1029
00:43:58.501 --> 00:44:01.680
<v Speaker 3>and I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just can't do anything right now.</v>

1030
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I just take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You forget,</v>

1031
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.170
<v Speaker 3>like you don't feel the joy of just</v>
<v Speaker 3>being healthy.</v>

1032
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It just escapes us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just so think it's normal</v>

1033
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.860
<v Speaker 3>taken for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1034
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1035
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:20.391
<v Speaker 3>do you think that you're stepping away</v>
<v Speaker 3>from race car driving when you deciding</v>

1036
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 3>it's just like enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that in some ways that this</v>

1037
00:44:26.641 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 3>is you appreciating other aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life too,</v>

1038
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.883
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1039
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

1040
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 1>looking at your racing thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1041
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot,</v>

1042
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>I did enough and then why don't I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate all the other stuff?</v>

1043
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good question that will</v>

1044
00:44:41.801 --> 00:44:43.610
<v Speaker 2>lead me into a good thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1045
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually more me being</v>

1046
00:44:48.221 --> 00:44:52.030
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think everyone would expect since</v>

1047
00:44:52.031 --> 00:44:56.290
<v Speaker 2>I do what I do at the level that I do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the racing is my only thing I care</v>

1048
00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:57.220
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it so much.</v>

1049
00:44:57.221 --> 00:45:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll do anything I drive every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is no.</v>

1050
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I like racing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

1051
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:05.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things I don't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>like about it too and I'm grateful for</v>

1052
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:06.280
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's given me,</v>

1053
00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:10.330
<v Speaker 2>but if you were to ask me what I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of racing and my personal life,</v>

1054
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to the racetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really watch races.</v>

1055
00:45:12.881 --> 00:45:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

1056
00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:17.380
<v Speaker 2>So those aren't my hobbies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your hobbies or your real loves.</v>

1057
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.210
<v Speaker 1>What do you not like about it?</v>

1058
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I would say that in the last year.</v>

1059
00:45:24.441 --> 00:45:25.940
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

1060
00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:31.030
<v Speaker 2>as far as an energetic space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just so sad and negative at times.</v>

1061
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even in just racing in general,</v>

1062
00:45:34.101 --> 00:45:37.730
<v Speaker 2>most of the time it's miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have some days that are good,</v>

1063
00:45:37.731 --> 00:45:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time it's not happy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wish there was,</v>

1064
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:41.030
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1065
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.870
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1066
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not satisfied.</v>

1067
00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:46.260
<v Speaker 2>You wish somebody would have treated you</v>
<v Speaker 2>better out there.</v>

1068
00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:47.900
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things to be negative</v>

1069
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:50.950
<v Speaker 2>about and just the grind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1070
00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 2>it's the people like everybody's worn</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and you know,</v>

1071
00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to be really careful about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are around you because they</v>

1072
00:45:59.541 --> 00:46:02.870
<v Speaker 2>got to be in a good mood because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to spiral out of control because</v>

1073
00:46:02.871 --> 00:46:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you see each other for three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four days a week,</v>

1074
00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:06.980
<v Speaker 2>every week for 40 weeks a year.</v>

1075
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1076
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you got to be in a good space with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1077
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:13.670
<v Speaker 2>but it still doesn't alienate you</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely even if you're in a good</v>

1078
00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.950
<v Speaker 2>space that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones next to you because you got a</v>

1079
00:46:15.951 --> 00:46:19.580
<v Speaker 2>car next to you on both sides and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>garage and hollers next to each other</v>

1080
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:22.640
<v Speaker 2>and buses right next to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a bunch of other people.</v>

1081
00:46:22.641 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1082
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:24.700
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1083
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of negativity to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

1084
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lot of grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just kind of feels like the grind a</v>

1085
00:46:29.991 --> 00:46:33.830
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just kind of felt like it</v>

1086
00:46:33.831 --> 00:46:37.160
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a space that I wanted to be in as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much anymore.</v>

1087
00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be in a happy space where I'm</v>

1088
00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:43.400
<v Speaker 2>just doing things that bring me joy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1089
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just wasn't doing that as much or I</v>

1090
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.880
<v Speaker 2>was noticing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was noticing I was missing that or</v>

1091
00:46:49.881 --> 00:46:52.280
<v Speaker 2>wanting it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really what it comes from</v>

1092
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:57.281
<v Speaker 2>is growing as a person and realizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's afraid to take</v>

1093
00:46:57.471 --> 00:47:00.560
<v Speaker 2>chances and do something new in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life because they're identified a</v>

1094
00:47:00.561 --> 00:47:03.980
<v Speaker 2>certain way or there'll be judged if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do it or judged if they do</v>

1095
00:47:03.981 --> 00:47:07.130
<v Speaker 2>something different and who are they now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are they crazy and what are they</v>

1096
00:47:07.131 --> 00:47:10.010
<v Speaker 2>thinking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just life.</v>

1097
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Just do things that make you happy.</v>

1098
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and the negative aspects of</v>

1099
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 1>it is all interpersonal relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so talking to people,</v>

1100
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about that the grind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of racing itself,</v>

1101
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 1>like the heat of being in the car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strain and the intensity and the</v>

1102
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 1>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking.</v>

1103
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1104
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the first thing.</v>

1105
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exists on some level,</v>

1106
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:34.660
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1107
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work out twice a day,</v>

1108
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:37.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times,</v>

1109
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:40.450
<v Speaker 2>so I'm okay with the whole physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind of things.</v>

1110
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:41.284
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1111
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crossfit and like interval running,</v>

1112
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting,</v>

1113
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1114
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Circuits twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Volt stuff.</v>

1115
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of days a week.</v>

1116
00:47:53.861 --> 00:47:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I do twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe more intensity.</v>

1117
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intense for sure.</v>

1118
00:47:57.821 --> 00:47:58.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1119
00:47:58.401 --> 00:47:59.234
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1120
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.270
<v Speaker 2>that's the name of the game and get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in,</v>

1121
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:02.840
<v Speaker 2>get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1122
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1123
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.420
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean that,</v>

1124
00:48:05.421 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physical part of racing exists and</v>

1125
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 2>it is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1126
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:12.190
<v Speaker 2>you recover from that every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1127
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1128
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1129
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 2>And I just love so many other things.</v>

1130
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1131
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest project I have is my wine.</v>

1132
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.190
<v Speaker 2>I bought the property in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted a vineyard and it's finally for</v>

1133
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 2>sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1134
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1135
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 2>so it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started in 2009.</v>

1136
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:34.390
<v Speaker 2>So nine years bought the property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted.</v>

1137
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>It started from nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it came from in 2006.</v>

1138
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I went to Napa Valley on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a trip and was on this beautiful</v>

1139
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 2>property and it's like looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fog and the valley and it was wonderful</v>

1140
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Keesha's and fruits for breakfast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing white wine.</v>

1141
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:50.891
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1142
00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 2>it'd be so cool if I could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this some day,</v>

1143
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have $50,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least not right now anyway.</v>

1144
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I never abandoned the thought</v>

1145
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:01.880
<v Speaker 2>that I would be able to afford that</v>
<v Speaker 2>someday.</v>

1146
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't then.</v>

1147
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1148
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I just started the process a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1149
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy a wine that was built and</v>
<v Speaker 2>established with the vineyard.</v>

1150
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I bought dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted the vineyard.</v>

1151
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 2>You go about doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do hire someone?</v>

1152
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>

1153
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that day I met a winemaker who ended up</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into consulting instead of just</v>

1154
00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 2>being at one winery and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he actually helped me pick the</v>

1155
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:25.790
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1156
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 2>he's still my winemaker today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you bought this piece of land and</v>

1157

<v Speaker 2>Latin word means dream.</v>

1165
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at some language</v>
<v Speaker 2>translations trying to come up with that</v>

1166
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 2>was probably trying to come up with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an llc or something like that to</v>

1167
00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.690

1168
00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.471
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1169
00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 2>this is way too cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1170
00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 2>what should the wine should be called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1171
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:03.681
<v Speaker 2>so Somnio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1172
00:50:03.681 --> 00:50:07.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a Latin word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Are you doing red and white or just</v>

1173
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 2>so ready to start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1174
00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the only the vineyard is Cabernet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cab franc,</v>

1175
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 2>petite for doe and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so from the cab franc and petite or doe</v>

1176
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.360
<v Speaker 2>bleed off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make a rose a this year.</v>

1177
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we also then source some grapes</v>

1178
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 2>from Knight's Valley to make a 70 old</v>
<v Speaker 2>blank.</v>

1179
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1180
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just decided it was going to come out</v>

1181
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 2>in the spring along with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the cab or early release and the</v>

1182
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1183
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and the rosy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it needed some time in barrel,</v>

1184
00:50:36.511 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 2>so we're gonna wait a little longer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in barrel.</v>

1185
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that much take a shitload of your</v>

1186
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 1>time and thinking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1187
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the least amount of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that company.</v>

1188
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine if you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant investment,</v>

1189
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.700
<v Speaker 1>you got the scholarship and investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you have someone working for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're growing grapes,</v>

1191
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.750
<v Speaker 2>two employees and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1192
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.190
<v Speaker 2>farmers that farm it not full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they farm many other properties</v>

1193
00:51:02.191 --> 00:51:03.570
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

1194
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Were you affected at all by the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fires?</v>

1195
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I was really lucky that the</v>

1196
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Napa valley fires were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Silverado trail side up.</v>

1197
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It's actually very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very close to Howell Mountain</v>

1198
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Appalachian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

1199
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.140
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 60 feet off of being home out in</v>

1200
00:51:19.141 --> 00:51:20.640
<v Speaker 2>the Appalachians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1201
00:51:20.641 --> 00:51:24.960
<v Speaker 2>way down south on Silverado trail there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fire and then straight across the</v>

1202
00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:27.990
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not too far laterally across,</v>

1203
00:51:27.991 --> 00:51:31.140
<v Speaker 2>but it was all the way across the valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the fires on the other side.</v>

1204
00:51:31.141 --> 00:51:34.050
<v Speaker 2>So I was about as far away from it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I could get.</v>

1205
00:51:34.051 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 2>And so I just talked to my winemaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1206
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:39.600
<v Speaker 2>a few days ago and he said that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nothing,</v>

1207
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.690
<v Speaker 2>no residual from any of the fires or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1208
00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:44.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with my wine anyway.</v>

1209
00:51:44.761 --> 00:51:45.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1210
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.280
<v Speaker 1>so that whole area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a bummer that far was in the</v>

1211
00:51:48.281 --> 00:51:49.740
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh,</v>

1212
00:51:49.741 --> 00:51:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you said it was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the exact number,</v>

1213
00:51:51.991 --> 00:51:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but it was something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was going a football field</v>

1214
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.860
<v Speaker 1>distance in three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at its peak.</v>

1215
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I know that the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the big reason was the wind came</v>

1216
00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:04.590
<v Speaker 2>in that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 40 plus mile an hour winds came</v>

1217
00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:06.570
<v Speaker 2>through that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1218
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.250
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very devastating for some.</v>

1219
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one company.</v>

1220
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.990
<v Speaker 2>The clothing line is called warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1221
00:52:12.991 --> 00:52:16.140
<v Speaker 2>so that came out a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January of last year of [inaudible] 17</v>

1222
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.100
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1223
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.183
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

1224
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.650
<v Speaker 1>is it like affliction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like skulls and swords and shit?</v>

1225
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:23.603
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1226
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.470
<v Speaker 2>doesn't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your jacket I have on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Lovely.</v>

1228
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more athleisure.</v>

1229
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so leisure,</v>

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1231
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1236
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.620

<v Speaker 2>tee shirts and jackets and sweatshirts</v>

1237
00:52:46.621 --> 00:52:49.020
<v Speaker 2>and athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1238
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:50.421
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1239
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back to this wine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1240
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.540
<v Speaker 1>so you have this thought in your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>about some.</v>

1241
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Dang it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll go by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling me where I can get it.</v>

1243
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Can you get it anywhere else?</v>

1244
00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Omnium wine.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sold in very many places and</v>

1245
00:53:01.481 --> 00:53:02.550
<v Speaker 2>mostly online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1246
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.050
<v Speaker 2>there's not very much made so.</v>

1247
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can order it online and you guys</v>

1248
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.650
<v Speaker 1>will ship it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1249
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So now you get this piece of property</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start talking to this guy who</v>

1250
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>was a consultant and you started talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about making wine.</v>

1251
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the process like how does</v>
<v Speaker 1>it you have to buy the property and then</v>

1252
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.280
<v Speaker 1>how do you get the seeds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the right grapes?</v>

1253
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:23.090
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

1254
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through a bunch of</v>

1255
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.320
<v Speaker 2>permitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1256
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>so permitting for a plans for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1257
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain grades that are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's over 20 degrees grade,</v>

1258
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 2>then you have to have special approvals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under you can plant.</v>

1259
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So I literally planted six acres ish of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max,</v>

1260
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that's the Max that I could plant on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 acres that I have that was below 20</v>

1261
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 2>degree grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1262
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1263
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through erosion control</v>

1264
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 2>permitting because it's the slopes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to dig up the ground,</v>

1265
00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it to slide down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain if it rains.</v>

1266
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:03.471
<v Speaker 2>So we had to kind of get creative with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the infrastructure to dissipate</v>

1267
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 2>the water and so it didn't create just</v>
<v Speaker 2>rivers and rushing of new dirt sliding</v>

1268
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 2>down the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1269
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:12.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's al at that elevation a</v>

1270
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:13.790
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1271
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.140
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1272
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.150
<v Speaker 2>and then you hire farmers and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winemaker helps pick out the root stock</v>

1273
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:24.450
<v Speaker 2>and the clones and then they plan it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wait a couple of years for it to be</v>

1274
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 2>ready and then the start making wine.</v>

1275
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.410
<v Speaker 3>So it starts with clones which stops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1276
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.960
<v Speaker 3>rootstock and what does he graft on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>clone that they want?</v>

1277
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 3>What's a rootstock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the actual route,</v>

1278
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be.</v>

1279
00:54:36.741 --> 00:54:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1280
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew every single thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking to the nth degree,</v>

1281
00:54:41.181 --> 00:54:46.181
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that would be like cabernet</v>
<v Speaker 2>petite rideau white wine,</v>

1282
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1283
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they did all this,</v>

1284
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I know I would want to see what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fascinating.</v>

1285
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Tiny little tiny little roots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just send it</v>

1286
00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.560
<v Speaker 2>trellising up and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get into,</v>

1287
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your winemaker,</v>

1288
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.240
<v Speaker 2>they decide then how much fruit to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sort of the vine comes up and</v>

1289
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>splits off and makes like a tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1290
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:15.560
<v Speaker 2>and so they decide how many clusters</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep on each side to determine,</v>

1291
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of wine you're making.</v>

1292
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we drop a lot of fruit to make really</v>

1293
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 2>good</v>

1294
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.360
<v Speaker 3>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean by drop fruit?</v>

1295
00:55:23.361 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd lose literally cut the cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cluster off of the vine.</v>

1296
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.043
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1297
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 2>that's why like if you're buying bulk</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine,</v>

1298
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:34.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not dropping a damn thing right?</v>

1299
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're buying grapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also not dropping a damn thing</v>

1300
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:37.381
<v Speaker 2>or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1301
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.400
<v Speaker 2>not as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably because they're,</v>

1302
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.750
<v Speaker 2>because they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

1303
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you're paying by the ton.</v>

1304
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.560
<v Speaker 3>So this is a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really long process to go nine</v>

1305
00:55:47.561 --> 00:55:51.190
<v Speaker 3>years from the time you start to making</v>
<v Speaker 3>your first bottles.</v>

1306
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Probably why most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have enough money to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>a winery,</v>

1308
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 2>you're probably a bit older and like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>run out of time.</v>

1309
00:55:58.310 --> 00:55:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1310
00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:00.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially</v>

1311
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.980
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get any return on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment,</v>

1312
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lot of millions in the hole,</v>

1313
00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:05.380
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a passion project.</v>

1315
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it as an investment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it because just you</v>

1316
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.570
<v Speaker 2>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1317
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.310
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1318
00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.713

1319
00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.680
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Why not do what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just money.</v>

1321
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love the lifestyle.</v>

1322
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 3>So I want to share that with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are styled napa</v>

1325
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 2>sitting down together and sharing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1326
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 2>the stories of the vineyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of how it came along.</v>

1327
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

1328
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.650
<v Speaker 2>the good thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is people were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1332
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.640
<v Speaker 2>but that's what people connect to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1333
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:40.691
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1334
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then it's a matter of getting that</v>

1335
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 2>story to the psalms in different</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants so that they can tell you</v>

1340
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.690
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if my wine was a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>story that someone told,</v>

1341
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:53.501
<v Speaker 2>and then they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1346
00:56:58.271 --> 00:57:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have that be the backstory</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the front story.</v>

1347
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you know maynard teen and from tool</v>

<v Speaker 2>Jerome,</v>

1355
00:57:16.561 --> 00:57:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a little cellar door in jerome.</v>

1356
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:20.760
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1357
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met him.</v>

1358
00:57:21.781 --> 00:57:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I tried to meet him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't.</v>

1359
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:26.630
<v Speaker 3>He's actually in town I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1360
00:57:26.631 --> 00:57:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's still here.</v>

1361
00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:29.850
<v Speaker 3>He was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was here yesterday for sure.</v>

1362
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sorts of.</v>

1363
00:57:30.661 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Some of his grapes from California I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think for SOM is whining.</v>

1364
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did a similar thing,</v>

1365
00:57:34.861 --> 00:57:38.790
<v Speaker 3>but he did it in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just bought this land and then</v>

1366
00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:41.940
<v Speaker 3>develop it in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the red,</v>

1367
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I think the better read came from</v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

1368
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a freak.</v>

1369
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.200
<v Speaker 3>He's a real crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>

1370
00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:51.240
<v Speaker 3>Super Intelligent too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super,</v>

1371
00:57:51.241 --> 00:57:52.800
<v Speaker 3>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too Smart.</v>

1372
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Too Smart to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people is just so out there and</v>

1373
00:57:55.851 --> 00:58:00.851
<v Speaker 3>it's an intense as well and maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do with the choices.</v>

1374
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a lead singer,</v>

1375
00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 3>three fucking bands and then says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then let me,</v>

1376
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 3>let me just start making my own wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opened up a restaurant.</v>

1377
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't do enough shit.</v>

1378
00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:14.150
<v Speaker 3>He does Jujitsu all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't do enough.</v>

1379
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys know him.</v>

1380
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:19.080
<v Speaker 3>He was over here for Jujitsu to</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars.</v>

1381
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:21.890
<v Speaker 3>John Danaher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was at one of his seminars yesterday.</v>

1382
00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's a maniac.</v>

1383
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe make wine then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1384
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be weird.</v>

1385
00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:29.970
<v Speaker 3>The normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good way of looking at</v>

1386
00:58:29.971 --> 00:58:31.520
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with being weird.</v>

1387
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Normally in conventional or the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 3>of weird.</v>

1388
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I looked it up.</v>

1417
00:59:51.361 --> 00:59:52.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1418
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.550
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my place is in Scottsdale,</v>

1419
00:59:53.551 --> 00:59:55.230
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's out in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1420
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 2>He's his vineyard probably jerome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1421
00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in that area was on the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a mountain.</v>

1422
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a cool place to go if you're</v>

1423
01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:06.420
<v Speaker 2>ever visiting Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerome is really interesting.</v>

1424
01:00:06.421 --> 01:00:08.670
<v Speaker 2>You kind of wind up this mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get up to the top.</v>

1425
01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:12.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like supposedly all haunted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very bizarre.</v>

1426
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.643
<v Speaker 2>But there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1427
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:16.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean the last I knew it was a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago that I was there,</v>

1428
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a cool cellar door and there's</v>

1429
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:22.590
<v Speaker 2>some restaurants and whatnot and it's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the mountain.</v>

1430
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1431
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 3>that's maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of thing he's into and</v>

1432
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:32.441
<v Speaker 3>he's very wise to about balancing out</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rockstar life versus like,</v>

1433
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>was attractive to him about creating a</v>

1434
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:37.874
<v Speaker 3>wine.</v>

1435
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>

1436
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I think I've feel like I've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life how much grounding I need to</v>

1437
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.410
<v Speaker 2>balance me out and it's not like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just like everybody needs 50 slash</v>

1438
01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:50.244
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1439
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.910
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of the time walking around in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods and 50 percent of the time</v>

1440
01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:55.410
<v Speaker 2>doing your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1441
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's different.</v>

1442
01:00:56.641 --> 01:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1443
01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>maybe 20 percent of the time I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a walk in nature or do a yoga class</v>

1444
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.350
<v Speaker 2>or meditate or something like that.</v>

1445
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like,</v>

1446
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:13.380
<v Speaker 3>do you need decompression time just from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole celebrity thing to being</v>

1447
01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:18.410
<v Speaker 3>interviewed and media and people paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to you want to take pictures</v>

1448
01:01:18.451 --> 01:01:19.091
<v Speaker 3>with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just.</v>

1449
01:01:19.091 --> 01:01:21.120
<v Speaker 3>The constant assault.</v>

1450
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel it's exhausting because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening and I'm paying attention.</v>

1451
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm answering your questions honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I think most people can just go</v>

1452
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:35.801
<v Speaker 2>into autopilot mode and it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as mentally exhausting for them.</v>

1453
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1454
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just being on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1455
01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just have to be on all the</v>

1456
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1457
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1458
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 2>the being on part is nice to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1459
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

1460
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of answering the questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just a matter of having</v>

1461
01:01:52.481 --> 01:01:53.370
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1462
01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:58.270
<v Speaker 2>navigating life and people staring at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or wanting something from you or</v>

1463
01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>thinking they want something from you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because you're trained because too</v>

1464
01:02:01.481 --> 01:02:04.680
<v Speaker 2>many people have wanted something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to,</v>

1465
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the demands of the things that</v>

1466
01:02:06.311 --> 01:02:07.900
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on an airplane twice a week doing</v>

1468

1469
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.570

01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>away from public life when you stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>racing?</v>

1490
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.340

<v Speaker 2>when I moved to England when I was 16,</v>

1491
01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I live by myself eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did you do that?</v>

1492
01:03:04.611 --> 01:03:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you move to England to race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were racing in England?</v>

1493
01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left high school and I was 16.</v>

1494
01:03:09.821 --> 01:03:12.350
<v Speaker 2>I moved to England and then I lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for three years.</v>

1495
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:15.020
<v Speaker 2>How do you parents handle that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my mom cried a lot.</v>

1496
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't.</v>

1497
01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>they also couldn't imagine me not having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunities so they let me go when</v>

1499
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I left high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a racing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>exposed versus stock cars,</v>

1503
01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:37.010
<v Speaker 2>which are Nascar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so open wheel wheels open.</v>

1504
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was no wings on the cars that I</v>

1505
01:03:39.051 --> 01:03:40.400
<v Speaker 2>was driving over there at that point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1506
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.360
<v Speaker 2>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1507
01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:45.470
<v Speaker 2>no wing open wheel cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just starting my,</v>

1508
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.170
<v Speaker 2>starting my career really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause from go carts,</v>

1509
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be a professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>go-kart drivers.</v>

1510
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:51.140
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1511
01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get into cars as soon as I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this come up.</v>

1512
01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 14 and I was at the Indianapolis</v>

1513
01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Motor speedway and I went into a suite</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was some British dude in there</v>

1514
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and so I started asking about cars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1515
01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>we're at the race track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1516
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.100
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this family that he works for has a</v>

1517
01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:11.540
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a race team,</v>

1518
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.840
<v Speaker 2>and so I guess I asked all the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions and I'm two years later when I</v>

1519
01:04:17.211 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 2>was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked me and my dad to come back to</v>

1520
01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>indy and meet with them and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>going over to England and race and they</v>

1521
01:04:23.361 --> 01:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>said I could learn more in one year in</v>
<v Speaker 2>England than five years in America.</v>

1522
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>And it was not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I did anyway.</v>

1523
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm English pretty please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy pompous.</v>

1524
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1525
01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might make England people from England</v>

1526
01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.890
<v Speaker 2>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not many that I've liked.</v>

1527
01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love English.</v>

1528
01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:44.500
<v Speaker 2>People are the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wondering,</v>

1529
01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was just my environment like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1530
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>that no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one kept in touch after I left and</v>

1531
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.120
<v Speaker 2>lived there for three years and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept in touch with me at all.</v>

1532
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you were too intense for English</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1533
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also have like,</v>

1534
01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.330
<v Speaker 3>like this is where you are in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you stay.</v>

1535
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're very like rigid class</v>

1536
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:04.730
<v Speaker 3>structure is there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1537
01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that moved to California</v>
<v Speaker 3>from England and they are like,</v>

1538
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.570
<v Speaker 3>the people over here are so much more</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic about it</v>

1539
01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:12.950
<v Speaker 2>and open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1540
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:13.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1541
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:15.620
<v Speaker 2>just like bring you in and prove me</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1542
01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like prove to me I got to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend,</v>

1543
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the European mentality.</v>

1544
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>A little bit more guarded.</v>

1545
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 3>Well also being a 16 year old girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>living there by yourself,</v>

1546
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:27.910
<v Speaker 3>not knowing anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad.</v>

1547
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:28.893
<v Speaker 3>That had to be</v>

1548
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.280
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew a lot so I learned more there in</v>

1549
01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:35.760
<v Speaker 2>one year than five years in America from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a personal standpoint.</v>

1550
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went over there and I was very open</v>

1551
01:05:38.371 --> 01:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unguarded and would tell anyone</v>

1552
01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:44.010
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1553
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.260
<v Speaker 2>how that work out for it didn't work out</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

1554
01:05:46.261 --> 01:05:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I got hurt a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated men after that.</v>

1555
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1556
01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.870
<v Speaker 3>English accents now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you at from men,</v>

1557
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.793
<v Speaker 3>I kind of obey</v>

1558
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:57.720
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little bit.</v>

1559
01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Do a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1560
01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>a little scarred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1561
01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.370
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1562
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.830
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came home and my parents describe me</v>

1563
01:06:03.831 --> 01:06:06.240
<v Speaker 2>as very cold when I came home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very guarded,</v>

1564
01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.690
<v Speaker 2>very cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys visit back and forth</v>

1565
01:06:08.691 --> 01:06:11.990
<v Speaker 2>between them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like twice a year and they would come</v>

1566
01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>over once or twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't alienation.</v>

1567
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:15.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they said you were cold when he got</v>

1569
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:18.824
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.760
<v Speaker 3>You became hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1571
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>

1572
01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:23.443
<v Speaker 3>I know</v>

1573
01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the hardest things in life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out who you really are.</v>

1574
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Like what you really enjoy who you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>

1575
01:06:30.171 --> 01:06:34.010
<v Speaker 2>what you stand for instead of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures told you.</v>

1576
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.280
<v Speaker 3>What advice do you give someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do that?</v>

1577
01:06:37.281 --> 01:06:38.051
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a nephew,</v>

1578
01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 3>he's a great kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't know what the fuck he</v>

1579
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:41.470
<v Speaker 3>wants to do was trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1580
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first quick couple of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do to identify what it is</v>

1581
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:51.031
<v Speaker 2>that you're interested in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's true to you as you</v>

1582
01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what do you do for your hobbies?</v>

1583
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.720
<v Speaker 2>That's very insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you enjoyed it?</v>

1584
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 2>If you were by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a job for you.</v>

1585
01:06:59.021 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't illegal here in California</v>

1586
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.320
<v Speaker 2>now was sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1587
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like some guru farmer.</v>

1588
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also this is like an odd one,</v>

1589
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but look at the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the pictures on your phone or</v>

1590
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 2>look at the pictures that you post on</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media maybe or something like</v>

1591
01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever you take pictures is also</v>

1592
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>of pretty insightful for what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>

1593
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 2>You're not taking pictures of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't care about that true to your</v>

1594
01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're all selfies or pictures</v>

1595
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then I think your ego is very loud.</v>

1596
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any selfies on your phone?</v>

1597
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why I selfies for me</v>

1598
01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:47.710
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so annoying.</v>

1599
01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.580
<v Speaker 2>But Office Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1600
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:51.641
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1601
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:52.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1602
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:55.110
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way I do them as if I am kind</v>

1603
01:07:55.111 --> 01:07:56.050
<v Speaker 2>of promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1604
01:07:56.051 --> 01:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's a matter of promoting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy lifestyle.</v>

1605
01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's me in the gym working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's something like that where I</v>

1606
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>can be like post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever workout I did and perhaps</v>

1607
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:11.010
<v Speaker 2>what you could look like if you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>these workouts sorta,</v>

1608
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:12.760
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe better really.</v>

1609
01:08:12.761 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1610
01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:15.080
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1611
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.680
<v Speaker 2>those are why I would take a selfie or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's with someone you really like,</v>

1612
01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take a picture with someone.</v>

1613
01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>That's something that I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1614
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Does that count as a selfie if it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do when someone else.</v>

1615
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1616
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just being creative with how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a picture of you.</v>

1617
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1618
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time I do it really is as</v>

1619
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 2>pretty much just to promote either like</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes I'm wearing for my clothing line</v>

1620
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>or like workout style stuff for my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

1621
01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1622
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.370
<v Speaker 2>my hair looks good today and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1623
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:43.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1624
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:45.490
<v Speaker 2>look at me and I say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1625
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego driven.</v>

1626
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I know as a woman who is very ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and successful and powerful,</v>

1627
01:08:56.150 --> 01:09:01.150
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of these social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars now that just do that?</v>

1628
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 1>They just stick the butt out and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures and a lot,</v>

1629
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:08.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing.</v>

1630
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And always will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:14.583
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1632
01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:18.070
<v Speaker 2>you probably deal with it more</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally yourself because it's a</v>

1633
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.980
<v Speaker 2>vicious circle where you want more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to keep doing more.</v>

1634
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You end up that,</v>

1635
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.900
<v Speaker 2>you end up in a place where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know yourself anymore because you're</v>

1636
01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:29.140
<v Speaker 2>doing it to fulfill someone else's wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>and desires more than yours.</v>

1637
01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1638
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Like going to the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1639
01:09:33.181 --> 01:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep your like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1640
01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I wore this like super cute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like leggings and a sports bra.</v>

1641
01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Now I got to wear a body suit and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing a thong and holy crap,</v>

1642
01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1643
01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.150
<v Speaker 2>look at me now I'm,</v>

1644
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1645
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1646
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who are you and after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow it's,</v>

1647
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>it's oddly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them their pages of like 17</v>

1648
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:54.550
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

1649
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1650
01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:56.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1651
01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1652
01:09:57.491 --> 01:09:58.810
<v Speaker 2>what it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1653
01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Then it begs the question like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your definition of success then?</v>

1654
01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't make money off 17</v>
<v Speaker 2>million followers,</v>

1655
01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:08.260
<v Speaker 2>then what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they do though.</v>

1656
01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 2>They do like sponsored posts and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1657
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why again,</v>

1658
01:10:12.281 --> 01:10:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to the next level all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to get more people kind of feeds</v>

1659
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.000
<v Speaker 2>the ego is getting fed.</v>

1660
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>But as a woman who's an attractive woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also very ambitious,</v>

1661
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.040
<v Speaker 1>like you could have just been one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

1662
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you like</v>

1663
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean man,</v>

1664
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think men look at it this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think there's a lot of</v>

1665
01:10:36.211 --> 01:10:39.290
<v Speaker 1>guys that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at guys who just do like workout</v>

1666
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.810
<v Speaker 1>instagrams or something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get looked at this.</v>

1667
01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And how about use your brains protein</v>
<v Speaker 1>powder,</v>

1668
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but as a woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean you're not falling back on your</v>

1669
01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>looks is what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have them but you,</v>

1670
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>that's just a part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously hyper ambitious on top</v>

1671
01:10:55.861 --> 01:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone who's just.</v>

1672
01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like they're wasting time or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like that's just them?</v>

1673
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's immaturity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:09.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean if that's your driving forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just your looks and you know,</v>

1675
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.040
<v Speaker 2>but there are some that have some</v>
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>

1676
01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can use it to drive a message.</v>

1677
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some that I've noticed like that</v>

1678
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>that really do have really positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages,</v>

1679
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.510
<v Speaker 2>spreading positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading good things.</v>

1680
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 2>But I'm promoting good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1681
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:27.690
<v Speaker 2>for those who aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I just think it's a level of</v>

1682
01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 2>immaturity and it's going to come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will come to bite them</v>

1683
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:35.790
<v Speaker 2>eventually because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the road lead to?</v>

1684
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a short live success.</v>

1685
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said this once.</v>

1686
01:11:39.611 --> 01:11:43.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a really great quote that beauty is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a short lived tyranny.</v>

1687
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1688
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:54.180
<v Speaker 2>like kind of leads me to a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a c one similar like the,</v>

1689
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1690
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 2>But it's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego is impatient because it knows</v>

1691
01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>it's time is limited where the soul is</v>
<v Speaker 2>patient because it no one has knows it</v>

1692
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:03.624
<v Speaker 2>has forever.</v>

1693
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 1>We should have memes on a strippers</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

1694
01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1695
01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of ego needs to be fed immediately.</v>

1696
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:14.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego wants something now and it's not</v>

1697
01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:17.010
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the longterm or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1698
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.810
<v Speaker 2>No sole decisions are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1699
01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:21.510
<v Speaker 2>perhaps unrealized for sore for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time,</v>

1700
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:24.060
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth will always come through.</v>

1701
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.730
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not living at</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

1702
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a transition</v>

1703
01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>now when you make like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put like an instagram post up of</v>

1704
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>workouts and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do that specifically because</v>

1705
01:12:35.031 --> 01:12:36.290
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to motivate people?</v>

1706
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does for me.</v>

1707
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:41.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I see somebody hot working</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and see a picture of them,</v>

1708
01:12:41.181 --> 01:12:41.761
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1709
01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>it better get to the gym working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1710
01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:46.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe put that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that chocolate down.</v>

1711
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that means people,</v>

1712
01:12:49.061 --> 01:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>especially people in my line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians love to mock things along</v>

1713
01:12:52.811 --> 01:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I take inspiration off of a lot of</v>

1714
01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:56.740
<v Speaker 1>people online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1716
01:12:57.881 --> 01:12:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my overwhelm,</v>

1717
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.080
<v Speaker 2>like overall what I hope for people too</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

1718
01:13:02.081 --> 01:13:03.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with um,</v>

1719
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.570
<v Speaker 2>with the book I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1720
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want people to find confidence</v>

1721
01:13:09.191 --> 01:13:12.940
<v Speaker 2>in themselves and develop a healthier</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with food and exercise.</v>

1722
01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think most people think of food as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a punishment,</v>

1723
01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:15.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1724
01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just eat this terrible vegetable.</v>

1725
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Or they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to work out the socks were</v>

1726
01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 2>working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be fun.</v>

1727
01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Working out can make you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food can also make you feel good.</v>

1728
01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Food is medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food will make you not only feel good</v>

1729
01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>but be good and look better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1730
01:13:31.631 --> 01:13:32.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1731
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1732
01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that in all of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>

1733
01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:40.740
<v Speaker 2>it drives people into a direction where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel good about it all.</v>

1734
01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:41.470
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1735
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:44.650
<v Speaker 2>there's more positivity around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel like there's so much</v>

1736
01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>negativity around eating healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out?</v>

1737
01:13:47.471 --> 01:13:49.000
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that just hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1738
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a lot of positivity</v>

1739
01:13:51.831 --> 01:13:56.420
<v Speaker 1>around it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are recognizing more</v>

1740
01:13:56.421 --> 01:14:01.421
<v Speaker 1>and more today the benefits of eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy in terms of like psychological</v>

1741
01:14:01.701 --> 01:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your.</v>

1742
01:14:02.891 --> 01:14:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Your mind works better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical benefits.</v>

1743
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.810
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about your choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about your momentum in</v>

1744
01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:09.381
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1745
01:14:09.381 --> 01:14:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the right path.</v>

1746
01:14:10.401 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating healthy,</v>

1747
01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working out on a regular basis.</v>

1748
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.690
<v Speaker 1>My body feels have got more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tuned in</v>

1749
01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.700
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember when I cut out dairy</v>

1750
01:14:20.701 --> 01:14:25.701
<v Speaker 2>and gluten years ago and my energy level</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally was up and consistent where</v>

1751
01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.950
<v Speaker 2>before it'd be like the random day where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1752
01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.720
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I so exhausted today?</v>

1753
01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any of those days anymore.</v>

1754
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1755
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:40.590
<v Speaker 1>When people eat a lot of refined</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and then shift to a diet</v>

1756
01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that has none of that stuff in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stunning the the effect that it has</v>

1757
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.100
<v Speaker 1>on your mid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd always tell people like if do you</v>

1758
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 1>need a nap in the middle of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those people just try,</v>

1759
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.330
<v Speaker 1>cut out sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out your refined carbohydrates and</v>

1760
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:57.130
<v Speaker 1>then watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will.</v>

1761
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>You will have so much more energy during</v>

1762
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 2>not a napper that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1763
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you one of those four hours of sleep</v>

1793
01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.830
<v Speaker 2>no dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dairy and then a couple of years ago,</v>

1794
01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:04.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1795
01:16:04.941 --> 01:16:07.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1796
01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an IVF treatment to freeze my eggs</v>

1797
01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:14.441
<v Speaker 2>because I'm getting older and I drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>race cars and I can't do any of that</v>

1798
01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.351
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1799
01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:17.300
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going for the insurance policy here.</v>

1800
01:16:17.301 --> 01:16:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they get those out of there?</v>

1801
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he really want to know.</v>

1802
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1803
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a ton of shots for like a</v>

1804
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ton of a ton of shots everyday you</v>

1805
01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:33.470
<v Speaker 2>stick them in your stomach and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ton of shots and so they dropped your</v>

1806
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:38.530
<v Speaker 2>estrogen down to nothing and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>ramp it up and then it multiplies the</v>

1807
01:16:38.781 --> 01:16:41.450
<v Speaker 2>follicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the follicles are what grows the</v>

1808
01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:44.480
<v Speaker 2>egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go in after a while and you start</v>

1809
01:16:44.481 --> 01:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>getting ultrasounds to see how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>follicles are growing on each side.</v>

1810
01:16:47.721 --> 01:16:48.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1811
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:50.900
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good for me.</v>

1812
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that many grows and they want them</v>

1813
01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:58.040
<v Speaker 2>each to get to like one bite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically almost an inch by an inch.</v>

1814
01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I had like,</v>

1815
01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a lot of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1816
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.980
<v Speaker 2>20 to 30 on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a shitload of real estate in my</v>

1817
01:17:06.981 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got very 30</v>

1818

<v Speaker 2>So 19 potential people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you think you're going to make?</v>

1849
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1850
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.270
<v Speaker 2>they say you need 20 to guarantee one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pretty much guaranteed one.</v>

1851
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an insurance policy.</v>

1852
01:18:47.031 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I can try a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way if I wanted to,</v>

1853
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.101
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1854
01:18:52.101 --> 01:18:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back to the back to the point like we</v>

1855
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>just got way off track here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is part of the story as to why</v>

1856
01:18:56.811 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I decided to change my diet and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my workout and why I ended up writing a</v>

1857
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:01.790
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1858
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 2>was because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gained like four pounds.</v>

1859
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just people I know.</v>

1860
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 2>These people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well who cares for pounds on my frame,</v>

1861
01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:12.110
<v Speaker 2>five foot who I'm small little and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1862
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.160
<v Speaker 2>for any girl out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1863
01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>your genes only fit when you're exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>the size that you are and then you gain</v>

1864
01:19:16.101 --> 01:19:18.890
<v Speaker 2>a couple pounds and they don't anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just uncomfortable,</v>

1865
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just gained some weight and not</v>

1866
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 2>anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1867
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1868
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 2>it was legit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just gained some weight because</v>

1869
01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:29.630
<v Speaker 2>of the hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it instantly also gave me some</v>

1870
01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for people out there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's dudes and testosterone or</v>

1871
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:39.641
<v Speaker 2>women with pregnancy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a menopause or whatever it is that</v>

1872
01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:42.710
<v Speaker 2>changes their hormones and sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just gained weight.</v>

1873
01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1874
01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:45.320
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>

1875
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just some excuse for getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>older and being lax about your diet or</v>

1876
01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 2>your exercise.</v>

1877
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.800
<v Speaker 2>It really happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>

1878
01:19:52.801 --> 01:19:54.920
<v Speaker 2>so I decided to eat Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1879
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.670
<v Speaker 2>for like a week really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do it for a week and I</v>

1880
01:19:58.671 --> 01:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1881
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>and I never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was two years ago.</v>

1882
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1883
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I also started doing two a day workouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to change it up and</v>

1884
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 2>sort of kick things up a notch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also realized that I was out</v>

1885
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>taking my dogs for walks and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1886
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:14.580
<v Speaker 2>if I'm walking them I might as well run</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do a workout too.</v>

1887
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1888
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 2>instead of mile and a half of walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the property,</v>

1889
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I would go for three.</v>

1890
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say you do two a days,</v>

1891
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:23.814
<v Speaker 3>like how do you break it up?</v>

1892
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're usually a little shorter,</v>

1893
01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:31.090
<v Speaker 2>like I would say somewhere between 20 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes each and uh,</v>

1894
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.740
<v Speaker 2>one of them will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do upper body,</v>

1895
01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:37.790
<v Speaker 2>lower body and an ab day and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotate through those really.</v>

1896
01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:38.440
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1897
01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I keep rotating through those</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] look if you do,</v>

1898
01:20:41.541 --> 01:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>if I do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sore I can't do upper body again</v>

1899
01:20:44.271 --> 01:20:47.930
<v Speaker 2>for a few days so I just rotate through</v>
<v Speaker 2>those and then I supplement and if I</v>

1900
01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:52.490
<v Speaker 2>have time I do interval running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all like sprint for 30 seconds,</v>

1901
01:20:52.491 --> 01:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>walk for 30 seconds and I'll do that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>

1902
01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:58.270
<v Speaker 3>And do you have someone train you or do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do everything yourself?</v>

1903
01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do everything myself.</v>

1904
01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write,</v>

1905
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I love writing workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the artistic side of me.</v>

1906
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:08.791
<v Speaker 2>I like the balance in the flow of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating something that has fluidity and</v>

1907
01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:11.300
<v Speaker 2>make sense and there's good transitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>through movement.</v>

1908
01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1909
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see your big rogue jim going</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1910
01:21:14.321 --> 01:21:14.950

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1911
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy to program for you if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want me to,</v>

1912
01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.050

<v Speaker 2>workouts.</v>

1913

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot.</v>

1914
01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.820

<v Speaker 3>I don't do crossfit,</v>

1915

<v Speaker 3>like three days.</v>

<v Speaker 3>becoming a supple Leopard.</v>

1928
01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:02.140

<v Speaker 3>but also a tool to scrape the area which</v>

1931
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:13.050
<v Speaker 3>is going to be like a blade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1932
01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.013
<v Speaker 3>like a metal.</v>

1933

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had that done before and topical</v>

01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:20.670
<v Speaker 3>cbd oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a really good legal.</v>

1935
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:21.561
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1936

1937
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Non Non psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the FDA is trying to stop that.</v>

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Follow the money.</v>

1940
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a good explanation for just about</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1941
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.060
<v Speaker 3>They tried to put it in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>classification as heroin.</v>

1942
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Solaris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's just a hundred percent</v>

1944
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drug companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions of decision making.</v>

1945
01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just creepy.</v>

1946
01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:46.130
<v Speaker 3>People with money that don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose money to cbd oil because it's so</v>

1947
01:22:46.131 --> 01:22:50.600
<v Speaker 3>much better for you and healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural and does the exact same page in</v>

1948
01:22:50.601 --> 01:22:55.550
<v Speaker 3>how much the drug companies would lose</v>
<v Speaker 3>for gain if they started selling it</v>

1949
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:58.310
<v Speaker 3>fucks just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to monopolize it.</v>

1950
01:22:58.311 --> 01:23:00.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patents,</v>

1951
01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.630
<v Speaker 3>they want to be able to patent things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1952
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's like we were talking about</v>

1953
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:07.060
<v Speaker 3>before about the things that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon.</v>

1954
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean that state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different plants that</v>

1955
01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 3>can deal with so many different ailments</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have.</v>

1956
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:15.870
<v Speaker 3>But then I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>

1957
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of them.</v>

1958
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done it?</v>

1959
01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.590

<v Speaker 3>but it's an interesting.</v>

1960
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you done any psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not done drugs ever.</v>

1961
01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 3>No drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pot.</v>

1962

1964
01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:31.450
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's scared the living daylights out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me when I was a kid and he told me</v>

1965
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:32.980
<v Speaker 2>that if I ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You won't ever be a race car driver.</v>

1967
01:23:36.101 --> 01:23:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You told me that about drinking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving to.</v>

1968
01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lose your license,</v>

1969
01:23:39.071 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what are you going to be when</v>

1970
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 2>you grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he threatened me with dad remedial</v>

1971
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.440
<v Speaker 2>remedial jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1972

1973
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth be told you can lose your license</v>

<v Speaker 2>still race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1975
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 2>truth be told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get drug tested until way</v>

1976
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.550
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we do get drug tests.</v>

1977
01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:02.430
<v Speaker 3>You're running a drug farm.</v>

<v Speaker 2>alcoholism.</v>

1984
01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do</v>

1985

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to do something,</v>

1990
01:24:34.351 --> 01:24:35.580

<v Speaker 3>but just take a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to freak out like the.</v>

1995
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:46.110
<v Speaker 3>One of the major problems that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have when they first started smoking</v>

1996
01:24:46.111 --> 01:24:48.330
<v Speaker 3>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll take like two or three hits and</v>

1997
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:50.730
<v Speaker 3>you can take one one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's it.</v>

1998
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Put it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right Jamie?</v>

01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:55.460
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll hit walkaway.</v>

2001
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck with edibles.</v>

2002
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Leave those alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

2003
01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:00.810
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to build up to those things.</v>

2004
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.510
<v Speaker 3>Those are completely different</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2005
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Experienced users.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2006
01:25:05.821 --> 01:25:07.980
<v Speaker 3>it's not just that even experienced</v>
<v Speaker 3>users,</v>

2007
01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.190
<v Speaker 3>they don't recognize the fact that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a completely different psychoactive</v>

2008
01:25:11.191 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 3>ingredient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:15.090
<v Speaker 3>When thc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>THC,</v>

2010
01:25:15.150 --> 01:25:17.070
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's processed by your liver</v>

2011
01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:21.030
<v Speaker 3>produces 11 hydroxy metabolite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is four to five times more</v>

2012
01:25:21.031 --> 01:25:23.520
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive than thc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way more potent.</v>

2013
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2014
01:25:24.331 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Which is why people fall freak out when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat edibles and they just don't,</v>

2015
01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:31.920
<v Speaker 3>don't eat the whole Brownie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No couple crumbs.</v>

2016
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:35.730
<v Speaker 3>And then don't even think about having</v>
<v Speaker 3>any more for at least two hours and let</v>

2017
01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:36.780
<v Speaker 3>it settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it</v>

2018
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.940
<v Speaker 2>give yourself time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't freak out after 15,</v>

2019
01:25:38.941 --> 01:25:40.680
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>

2020
01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

2021
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I'm drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2022
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:45.840
<v Speaker 2>sure man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my third drink.</v>

2023
01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:47.850
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem to be working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I hit it harder.</v>

2024
01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:48.570
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2025
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brownout or blackout or drugs or do</v>

2026
01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:53.340
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2027
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

2028
01:25:54.181 --> 01:25:56.340
<v Speaker 2>one of the first times I heard one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcasts,</v>

2029
01:25:56.341 --> 01:25:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about dmt.</v>

2030
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the motherlode DMT is the</v>

2031
01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive ingredient that's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca,</v>

2032
01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:06.450
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most potent stuff.</v>

2033
01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:09.360
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaner way to do it as opposed to</v>

2034
01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca where you throw up and shit.</v>

2035
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also quicker,</v>

2037
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the worst,</v>

2038
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.330
<v Speaker 3>the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a sick 15 or 20</v>

2039
01:26:20.331 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some places that are doing</v>

2040
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 3>it now where they're doing an</v>
<v Speaker 3>intravenously.</v>

2041
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>So those trips are apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was how they did it in.</v>

2042
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 3>There is a book called DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule molecule by this Guy</v>

2043
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Dr Rick Strassman who did all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies out of the University of New</v>

2044
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and they were the first FDA</v>
<v Speaker 3>approved clinical studies and it was a</v>

2045
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.870
<v Speaker 3>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:44.704
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets it.</v>

2047
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

2048
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:47.880
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't interview.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2049
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 3>And they were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for like 40 minutes,</v>

2051
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 3>like pull them off into the office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the other dimension.</v>

2052
01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say so other dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2053
01:26:58.531 --> 01:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>This dream state is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think is like a dream state?</v>

2054
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar because they believed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your brain during heavy rem sleep</v>

2055
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.960
<v Speaker 3>also produces dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May think that's because we all have it.</v>

2056
01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.780
<v Speaker 3>We all have the empty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has it.</v>

2057
01:27:10.781 --> 01:27:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has and everyone.</v>

2058
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's produced by your liver,</v>

2059
01:27:15.411 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 3>your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now they know it's also produced at</v>

2060
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 3>least in rats by your pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is literally your third eye.</v>

2061
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.040
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Insert reptiles that actually has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>retina and a lens.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Your pineal gland actually gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>calcified by fluoride in drinking water.</v>

2078
01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.270
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like some hippie horseshit.</v>

2079
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It does sound hippie horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see some scientific proof,</v>

2080
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:17.430
<v Speaker 2>but hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the hippy shit,</v>

2081
01:28:17.431 --> 01:28:19.110
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of scientific proof</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2082
01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:19.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2083
01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>There's not a sense of knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it comes down to is a sense</v>

2084
01:28:23.371 --> 01:28:24.300
<v Speaker 2>of knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2085
01:28:24.810 --> 01:28:27.600
<v Speaker 2>do you really feel like this is making</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to you?</v>

2086
01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Does it register or you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I believe this,</v>

2087
01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:32.940
<v Speaker 2>but I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where it came from.</v>

2088
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

2089
01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather trust scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like science too.</v>

2090
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.480
<v Speaker 2>My sister and I went and saw Neil</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrasse Tyson in Indianapolis over the</v>

2091
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.410
<v Speaker 2>winter when it was called the radio</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2092
01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.170
<v Speaker 2>It was called Dia an astrophysicist</v>
<v Speaker 2>reads the newspaper.</v>

2093
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he like pulled articles and just</v>

2094
01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:56.190
<v Speaker 2>laughed about them basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2095
01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Pluto came up because he was part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people part of the group that sort of</v>

2096
01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>said the Pluto wasn't planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2097
01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get very upset with them.</v>

2098
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.400
<v Speaker 2>He also loved to point out how there'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be something crazy and he'd be like,</v>

2099
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 2>let me point out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is in the science section of the</v>

2100
01:29:12.961 --> 01:29:15.990
<v Speaker 2>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as if like how did this make it to</v>

2101
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 2>the science section?</v>

2102
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to come on here sometime in</v>

2103
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 3>February and they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to talk to a guy who believes</v>

2104
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 3>the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2105
01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.310
<v Speaker 3>that guy made fun of that guy too.</v>

2106
01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:32.170
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you a reflection of what it</v>

2107
01:29:32.171 --> 01:29:33.850
<v Speaker 2>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the earth was flat,</v>

2108
01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's a shadow of a flat line</v>

2109
01:29:35.961 --> 01:29:37.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that's not true.</v>

2110
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's not true,</v>

2111
01:29:38.471 --> 01:29:41.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of young people out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there today that believed the earth is</v>

2112
01:29:41.831 --> 01:29:43.600
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe the earth is flat?</v>

2113
01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It's most certainly do not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's.</v>

2114
01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they not think we actually go into</v>

2115
01:29:49.011 --> 01:29:51.780
<v Speaker 2>outer space and they think that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake too,</v>

2116
01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's just a matter of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we landed on the moon.</v>

2117
01:29:55.210 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>If there's anything that I think is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more attractive conspiracy</v>

2118
01:30:01.421 --> 01:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the moon landing was because the</v>

2119
01:30:03.881 --> 01:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>only time they did it was between 1969</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 1972.</v>

2120
01:30:07.181 --> 01:30:09.730
<v Speaker 1>They did seven missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six were successful,</v>

2121
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:14.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only time in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history that people have been more than</v>

2122
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I think 400 miles above the earth's</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

2123
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the space shuttle missions,</v>

2124
01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.640
<v Speaker 1>all of the space station missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is inside 400 miles.</v>

2125
01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 1>The moon is like 260,000 miles there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and they've never even sent a</v>

2126
01:30:33.731 --> 01:30:36.040
<v Speaker 1>chicken in the space and had it come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back alive.</v>

2127
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They never sent anything in this space</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than people like into deep space</v>

2128
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>passed the van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allen radiation belt packs the</v>

2129
01:30:42.911 --> 01:30:45.700
<v Speaker 1>magnetosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most likely we went,</v>

2130
01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but if there's ever a conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's attractive to me it's that one</v>

2131
01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>because I just think it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating if during the Nixon</v>

2132
01:30:54.281 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>administration they really did fake it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2133
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:01.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weirdness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fake it.</v>

2134
01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2135
01:31:02.821 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 3>to show military superiority to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians and again,</v>

2136
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I used to believe they did fake it.</v>

2137
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was heavily on the side that they</v>

2138
01:31:10.411 --> 01:31:13.920
<v Speaker 3>faked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I realized I don't know Jack</v>

2139
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Shit about astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about rocket</v>

2140
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:18.800
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2141
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:22.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like me saying that they didn't go</v>

2142
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:26.280
<v Speaker 3>was literally an ignorant perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a guess.</v>

2143
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Well it was just being attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories,</v>

2144
01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 3>which is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is that conspiracy</v>

2145
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:36.930
<v Speaker 3>theories are really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>

2146
01:31:36.931 --> 01:31:38.010
<v Speaker 3>You have is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are really fun.</v>

2147
01:31:38.011 --> 01:31:38.844
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff.</v>

2148
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 2>A lot of stuff to get to the get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>core because there's,</v>

2149
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.360
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's arguments on both sides.</v>

2150
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.180
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also you have to recognize in</v>

2151
01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:50.330
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you do not want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>official story to be true.</v>

2152
01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And I do not an almost every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens like,</v>

2153
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moon landing or Ufo landings were any</v>

2154
01:31:57.741 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the crazy shit to be real.</v>

2155
01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I always want the UFO thing to be a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2156
01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:05.940
<v Speaker 1>They do have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even aliens.</v>

2157
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than likely that</v>

2158
01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:11.074
<v Speaker 1>there's something out</v>

2159
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:15.750
<v Speaker 2>to feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the only thing in the universe.</v>

2160
01:32:15.751 --> 01:32:17.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a little ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems stupid.</v>

2161
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It seems pretty ignorant and arrogant.</v>

2162
01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that it's what we</v>

2163
01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:28.121
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's most likely far beyond the</v>

2164
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:33.970
<v Speaker 1>places that we can currently travel to</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that by the time they get to</v>

2165
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>a high level of sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're most likely not even organic</v>

2166
01:32:39.231 --> 01:32:41.300
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's the future of</v>

2167
01:32:41.301 --> 01:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I those of consciousness.</v>

2168
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Well I think maybe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think there's a real problem</v>

2169
01:32:46.071 --> 01:32:48.080
<v Speaker 1>with the possibility of artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

2170
01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings are about to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2171
01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.480
<v Speaker 1>whether we recognize it as life or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what artificial life is going to be his</v>

2172
01:32:56.481 --> 01:32:58.850
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence is going to have</v>

2173
01:32:58.851 --> 01:33:03.851
<v Speaker 1>the ability to change itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply what human beings have been</v>

2174
01:33:05.061 --> 01:33:10.061
<v Speaker 1>able to do in terms of technological</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation by a rate of something</v>

2175
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:13.250
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in two years they'll be able to do</v>

2176
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:18.310
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years of innovation in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what we're capable of doing.</v>

2177
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:22.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is the,</v>

2178
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:27.380
<v Speaker 1>the last days of biological life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 100 years from now,</v>

2179
01:33:27.381 --> 01:33:29.120
<v Speaker 1>500 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2180
01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:32.360
<v Speaker 1>there won't be biological humans</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2181
01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I think this will be an archaic.</v>

2182
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 2>David will change as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2183
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2184
01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in everything the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2185
01:33:41.521 --> 01:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that in the Bible?</v>

2186
01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the apocalypse world will change as</v>

2187
01:33:46.031 --> 01:33:48.240
<v Speaker 2>we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the apocalypse local end is,</v>

2188
01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:49.200
<v Speaker 2>we know it right.</v>

2189
01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stuff in the Bible,</v>

2190
01:33:51.391 --> 01:33:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that's all local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

2191
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:55.740
<v Speaker 1>if you lived where Hurricane Katrina</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

2192
01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you would think the apocalypse was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2193
01:33:57.330 --> 01:34:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were in anywhere where something</v>

2194
01:34:01.831 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 1>really fucking crazy happened and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any contact with the outside</v>

2195
01:34:05.101 --> 01:34:06.210
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No cell phones,</v>

2196
01:34:06.211 --> 01:34:07.950
<v Speaker 1>no radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no TV didn't exist.</v>

2197
01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2198
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>True or isolated.</v>

2199
01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what all of our,</v>

2200
01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:15.840
<v Speaker 1>our notions of the apocalypse are there</v>
<v Speaker 1>periodic natural disasters that are</v>

2201
01:34:15.841 --> 01:34:19.980
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've proven that the entire</v>

2202
01:34:19.981 --> 01:34:24.390
<v Speaker 1>human race was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was down to a few thousand people</v>

2203
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:27.420
<v Speaker 1>because of a super volcano around 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2204
01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:32.280
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's been a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those events throughout history where</v>

2205
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the human race is brought down to an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an almost unmanageable level,</v>

2206
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:41.100
<v Speaker 1>and then we repopulated and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the origins of the</v>

2207
01:34:41.101 --> 01:34:44.910
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse or asteroidal impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are very common.</v>

2208
01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 1>They've happened all throughout history.</v>

2209
01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that ai is going to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate biological humans.</v>

2210
01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get into it too,</v>

2211
01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to first of all become</v>

2212
01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna take something and put it</v>

2213
01:34:58.671 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to enhance us was it's our</v>

2214
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:05.420
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate whether it's our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to see we're going to start</v>

2215
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 1>implanting chips into ourselves and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have improved body</v>

2216
01:35:09.981 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you break your arm and</v>

2217
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look Danica,</v>

2218
01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:15.740
<v Speaker 1>we can fix your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to take a year.</v>

2219
01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:20.920
<v Speaker 1>You have 17 broken bones or we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace it with an arm that works better</v>

2220
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>and it'll feel just like a regular arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to bring in Mike and Mike</v>

2221
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:28.420
<v Speaker 1>has a fake arm and he's going to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>you how it works and Mike's going to</v>

2222
01:35:28.421 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so much happier with my arm.</v>

2223
01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:30.944
<v Speaker 1>Then I was my face</v>

2224
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:34.240
<v Speaker 4>with my real arm drug pushers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2225
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.490
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lookout works and it's a free</v>

2226
01:35:36.491 --> 01:35:39.430
<v Speaker 4>vacation to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do this.</v>

2227
01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.600
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2228
01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I've watched some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard some youtube video of like it</v>

2229
01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:48.380
<v Speaker 4>was someone who channels other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those aspects.</v>

2230
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:52.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it was channeling the Palladian</v>
<v Speaker 4>so probably totally legit.</v>

2231
01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.470
<v Speaker 4>And she talked about how it was talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how as a,</v>

2232
01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.920
<v Speaker 4>as a human race we have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't alter ourselves too much</v>

2233
01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:02.630
<v Speaker 4>because then we won't exist as a human</v>
<v Speaker 4>race because we won't be able to</v>

2234
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:06.070
<v Speaker 4>procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is what keeps our race alive.</v>

2235
01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.950
<v Speaker 4>That's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you think about where we're</v>

2236
01:36:08.951 --> 01:36:11.620
<v Speaker 4>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also doesn't have to</v>

2237
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.780
<v Speaker 1>keep evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we got back,</v>

2238
01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:17.420
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think like monkeys when they were</v>

2239
01:36:17.421 --> 01:36:18.810
<v Speaker 1>living in trees thrown shit</v>

2240
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 4>different than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we gotta be chill.</v>

2241
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to stop being monkeys who</v>

2242
01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 4>will be able to throw shit at each other</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Dodge Jaguars bananas all day.</v>

2243
01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2244
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 4>I think people are afraid of change and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the human race is afraid of</v>

2245
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.970
<v Speaker 4>change too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're by no means personal.</v>

2246
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 4>People don't do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all.</v>

2247
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's afraid of change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taking a chance of having it be</v>

2248
01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's worse.</v>

2249
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's better,</v>

2250
01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's like the hallmark of your</v>

2251
01:36:44.601 --> 01:36:48.110
<v Speaker 4>whole life looking at 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not afraid of change.</v>

2252
01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a moment.</v>

2253
01:36:51.321 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the arm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a moment of um,</v>

2254
01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2255
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:57.770
<v Speaker 4>fear of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

2256
01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:00.020
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the next moment is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2257
01:37:00.021 --> 01:37:01.460
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's better than I could ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>expect.</v>

2258
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:02.740
<v Speaker 4>What if they imagined</v>

2259
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:05.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll give you two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you one robot arm that you</v>

2260
01:37:05.701 --> 01:37:08.310
<v Speaker 1>never have to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will always be strong.</v>

2261
01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.330
<v Speaker 1>You can get that one or you can get one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you constantly have to work out.</v>

2262
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2263
01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.620
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably take the robot arm.</v>

2264
01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.900
<v Speaker 4>But which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which robot arm would you take?</v>

2265
01:37:17.901 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 4>The one that you constantly have to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>out now or would you take the one that's</v>

2266
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:22.840
<v Speaker 4>just perfect?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably take the perfect one.</v>

2267
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 4>Never have to exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just Bam.</v>

2268
01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Just jacked all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted,</v>

2269
01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean working out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I still needed to do that for like</v>

2270
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2271
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:33.890
<v Speaker 4>feel good endorphin hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of,</v>

2272
01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

2273
01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:37.440
<v Speaker 4>then I would still do that right here by</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain.</v>

2274
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>
<v Speaker 4>from rush.</v>

2275
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:44.000
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would go do a lot more stuff like</v>

2276
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:46.060
<v Speaker 4>walking around in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

2277
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 4>That's good answer because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I really find enjoyment out of</v>

2278
01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I find enjoyment out of the</v>

2279
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:54.800
<v Speaker 4>intensity level of things and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>confidence that I get or the,</v>

2280
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:58.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to shift my mindset to this</v>

2281
01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:01.890
<v Speaker 4>sort of like all go all in.</v>

2282
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 4>Not no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no gain.</v>

2283
01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:07.890
<v Speaker 4>That's so cheesy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I can endure and the confidence</v>

2284
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 4>that comes from enduring and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

2285
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy that development of my mind and</v>

2286
01:38:13.951 --> 01:38:16.200
<v Speaker 4>my discipline and my confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

2287
01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.790
<v Speaker 4>but I'm probably just shifting more into</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoying,</v>

2288
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are a little more peaceful</v>

2289
01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:25.710
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so shifting more and to enjoy nature,</v>

2290
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:29.970
<v Speaker 4>but that would be the most fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing if I didn't enjoy nature anymore.</v>

2291
01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:32.090
<v Speaker 4>They started replacing body parts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2292
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:34.100
<v Speaker 4>you didn't give a shit about the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2293
01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 4>that would be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be sad.</v>

2294
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:39.240
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't take that body part then</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably wouldn't know until it's too</v>

2295
01:38:39.241 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 4>late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until they replace it.</v>

2296
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Probably gonna be dead before all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is real.</v>

2297
01:38:43.921 --> 01:38:44.830
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I think</v>

2298
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>those aliens are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people see Aliens,</v>

2299
01:38:47.251 --> 01:38:49.390
<v Speaker 1>those gray aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy guys.</v>

2300
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just what we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

2301
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking that a lot.</v>

2302
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's natural if you look at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monkey is and then if we were at some</v>

2303
01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.160
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some ancient hominid like Australia</v>

2304
01:39:02.161 --> 01:39:04.620
<v Speaker 1>pythagoreous or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cro-magnon man,</v>

2305
01:39:04.621 --> 01:39:07.350
<v Speaker 1>and then we moved on to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>homosapien.</v>

2306
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 1>If we keep going in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to look like.</v>

2307
01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.140
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look like a little skinny</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with big heads</v>

2308
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.330
<v Speaker 4>lollipops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 4>That's what I looked like when I had my</v>
<v Speaker 4>helmet on when I'm in my race suit.</v>

2310
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 4>People that are to alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point,</v>

2311
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:23.730
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you have a regular size helmet.</v>

2312
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.210
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did your helmet.</v>

2314
01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:31.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like that would be like a big guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing an enormous helmet.</v>

2315
01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a strong narrative?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Must have a wicked neck.</v>

2317
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:37.680
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you do exercises with it?</v>

2318
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't just carrying the helmet</v>

2319
01:39:39.991 --> 01:39:43.860
<v Speaker 4>around all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably that and just looking up,</v>

2320
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:46.380
<v Speaker 4>looking up to my nine foot target for</v>
<v Speaker 4>wall balls.</v>

2321
01:39:46.381 --> 01:39:47.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my neck hurts.</v>

2322
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2323
01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:50.830
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2324
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:52.500
<v Speaker 4>you're not out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the car that long.</v>

2325
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.370
<v Speaker 4>It might hurt a little bit when I get</v>
<v Speaker 4>back in an indy car again because the g</v>

2326
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:57.210
<v Speaker 4>forces are higher.</v>

2327
01:39:57.210 --> 01:39:59.400
<v Speaker 4>But you also lean your head against the</v>
<v Speaker 4>headrest.</v>

2328
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Usually the only thing that would make</v>
<v Speaker 4>me hurt my make my neck hurt a little</v>

2329
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:05.340
<v Speaker 4>bit as road courses at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road of indycar season.</v>

2330
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:08.190
<v Speaker 4>What is it like to test?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because acceleration and deceleration,</v>

2331
01:40:08.191 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing to hold you from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neck going head going forward.</v>

2332
01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:13.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not to the level that you would</v>

2333
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 4>drive that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2334
01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 4>there's just a device that is in case</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in an accident but it still</v>

2335
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:19.710
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

2336
01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:21.930
<v Speaker 4>holding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holding your neck forward and backwards</v>

2337
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 4>is a lot more sore than side to side</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you have a head rest.</v>

2338
01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:26.430
<v Speaker 4>So when you use it,</v>

2339
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.220
<v Speaker 1>get out of a long race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your whole body tired?</v>

2340
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in stock cars it's.</v>

2341
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:35.760
<v Speaker 4>So it's really a lot about dehydration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dehydration.</v>

2342
01:40:35.761 --> 01:40:36.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the car.</v>

2343
01:40:36.371 --> 01:40:38.340
<v Speaker 4>It's like 100 and 3,040 degrees in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2344
01:40:38.610 --> 01:40:40.720
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a tube and you start to</v>

2345
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 4>camelback?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That goes through the front of my</v>

2346
01:40:42.301 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 4>helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of blowers,</v>

2347
01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:45.540
<v Speaker 4>the back blower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a helmet blower,</v>

2348
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:49.590
<v Speaker 4>things that are cooler air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm here to tell you it's still hard</v>

2349
01:40:49.591 --> 01:40:50.940
<v Speaker 4>to sell in there or did I imagine</v>

2350
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a fire in a gigantic iron block</v>

2351
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 2>in front of you when the water and oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature is 300 degrees.</v>

2352
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2353
01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a greenhouse in the car.</v>

2354
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.760
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I runs right underneath you to.</v>

2355
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you're going to miss it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question.</v>

2356
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this just the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2357
01:41:09.521 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I going to miss the intensity?</v>

2358
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to miss certain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2359
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I will miss some of it a little</v>

2360
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and again I'm driving down the</v>

2361
01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 2>road and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably miss it a little bit.</v>

2362
01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:21.540
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2363
01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2364
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a decisive person so I'm good.</v>

2365
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering more if I'm going to</v>

2366
01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:34.350
<v Speaker 2>miss the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity level of the job and the</v>

2367
01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.180
<v Speaker 2>highs being so high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the lows being low.</v>

2368
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get the highest right.</v>

2369
01:41:41.281 --> 01:41:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And the duality of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the environment.</v>

2370
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if I'll miss some of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if whatever I do on the side will be</v>

2371
01:41:50.131 --> 01:41:53.720
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the age that most people retire</v>

2372
01:41:53.721 --> 01:41:55.700
<v Speaker 2>from racing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 35.</v>

2373
01:41:55.970 --> 01:42:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm a slightly young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say early forties after while</v>

2374
01:42:00.291 --> 01:42:03.050
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their body just takes too much and</v>

2375
01:42:03.051 --> 01:42:05.420
<v Speaker 2>you're just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly like especially if it's</v>

2376
01:42:05.421 --> 01:42:08.060
<v Speaker 2>Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just exhausted.</v>

2377
01:42:08.061 --> 01:42:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's my feeling anyway,</v>

2378
01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:12.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gone for 40 weeks a year on the</v>

2379
01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:17.660
<v Speaker 2>road and these really luxurious places</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world on the barbecue world tour,</v>

2380
01:42:17.661 --> 01:42:21.290
<v Speaker 2>like grilling out of your bus and living</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a bus for most of your life and</v>

2381
01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the road in and out of airplanes</v>

2382
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:29.600
<v Speaker 2>hours have nothing to do on the weekends</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're sitting there.</v>

2383
01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.950
<v Speaker 2>So just kind of the grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think he kind of just get a little</v>

2384
01:42:33.951 --> 01:42:37.040
<v Speaker 2>worn out and I could only imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2385
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean even like you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews and stuff like,</v>

2386
01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy doing interviews that aren't</v>

2387
01:42:42.351 --> 01:42:45.110
<v Speaker 2>based around how's your car this</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend?</v>

2388
01:42:45.111 --> 01:42:46.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just so boring there really.</v>

2389
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's fun for me to talk about working</v>

2390
01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:52.370
<v Speaker 2>out or cooking or wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

2391
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2392
01:42:53.271 --> 01:42:55.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or aliens.</v>

2393
01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:02.090
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine the boring grind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>media tour that you must have to go</v>

2394
01:43:02.091 --> 01:43:03.380
<v Speaker 2>through when you're raising all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2395
01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Danica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were moving quite fast out there</v>

2396
01:43:07.701 --> 01:43:11.000
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have overperformance I was watching</v>

2397
01:43:11.001 --> 01:43:12.380
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

2398
01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.440
<v Speaker 2>the old south park episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a bunch of Nascar drivers on</v>

2399
01:43:15.441 --> 01:43:17.720
<v Speaker 2>South Park and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the,</v>

2400
01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 2>it was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2401
01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.260
<v Speaker 2>cartman's trying to be poor and stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he could race Nascar.</v>

2402
01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>He was sponsored by badges cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

2403
01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.090
<v Speaker 2>ate a ton of ads to make them as stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he could.</v>

2404
01:43:32.091 --> 01:43:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And he realized that the more stupid he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>

2405
01:43:33.711 --> 01:43:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the more money spent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some more in debt.</v>

2406
01:43:35.361 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>He got and that's how you got poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just bought like jet skis and</v>

2407
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I think he says at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danica,</v>

2408
01:43:44.331 --> 01:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not having poor habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor and stupid as I am.</v>

2409
01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.141
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2410
01:43:48.141 --> 01:43:49.520
<v Speaker 2>You were in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in it.</v>

2411
01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Did you use your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

2412
01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 4>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on the simpsons that year too and</v>

2413
01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I did my voiceover for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for,</v>

2414
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 4>for south park now.</v>

2416
01:44:03.841 --> 01:44:05.510
<v Speaker 4>If you're on a show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's flattering,</v>

2417
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:06.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They to make,</v>

2418
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.520
<v Speaker 4>to make tv in a different capacity means</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're being noticed.</v>

2419
01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Especially South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the funniest show that's</v>

2420
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:15.830
<v Speaker 4>ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2421
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Especially like all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at all the episodes they've</v>

2422
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:21.440
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't even make sense how</v>

2423
01:44:21.441 --> 01:44:23.730
<v Speaker 4>creative they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was thinking is how</v>

2424
01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:29.110
<v Speaker 4>they're just insightful ahead of things</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot and definitely clever.</v>

2425
01:44:30.110 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Like with their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the delivery of it now they're wizards.</v>

2426
01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Just completely bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of car do you drive in regular</v>

2427
01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 4>life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please don't feel like a prius.</v>

2428
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:42.440
<v Speaker 4>Know if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2429
01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:44.690
<v Speaker 4>I just drove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was throwing some things into the</v>

2430
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:46.880
<v Speaker 4>recycling bin and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to do my part because</v>

2431
01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 4>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I burned fuel for living</v>

2432
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:54.200
<v Speaker 4>in terms of how much fossil fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if he each chart how much</v>

2433
01:44:54.201 --> 01:44:57.050
<v Speaker 4>fossil fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the average person burns would not be</v>

2434
01:44:57.051 --> 01:44:58.070
<v Speaker 4>doing well on that.</v>

2435
01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 4>That would not be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not do well with the</v>

2436
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 4>tree huggers are vegans of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the people loving animals like me,</v>

2437
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm all those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the forest.</v>

2438
01:45:11.541 --> 01:45:14.450
<v Speaker 4>I try and eat vegetables most of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2439
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:15.760
<v Speaker 4>Things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2440
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I also don't do my part when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>my job.</v>

2441
01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.890
<v Speaker 4>What kind of car do you drive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>

2442
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 4>So I've had cars for years through s</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the manufacturer.</v>

2443
01:45:24.801 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this past year we were sponsored by</v>

2444
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:28.034
<v Speaker 4>Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had a,</v>

2445
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.700
<v Speaker 4>I had a ford expedition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>e l I didn't know it.</v>

2446
01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:34.770
<v Speaker 4>He element it means extra long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

2447
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

2448
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hook you up with a Mustang,</v>

2449
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:43.520
<v Speaker 4>shelby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not very practical thing.</v>

2450
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.360
<v Speaker 4>We weren't even allowed to customize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>customize the wheels on that thing.</v>

2451
01:45:47.361 --> 01:45:50.660
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was bare bare bones because that was</v>

2452
01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 4>part of the contract.</v>

2453
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.590
<v Speaker 4>You get a car but you can't get anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>dressed up with the raptor.</v>

2454
01:45:57.930 --> 01:46:02.260
<v Speaker 4>So I could have had a raptor I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe like trucks aren't really me.</v>

2455
01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:05.640
<v Speaker 4>Whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>better than the l</v>

2456
01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.570
<v Speaker 4>A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:46:08.571 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I had a Tahoe and I drove for</v>

2458
01:46:10.551 --> 01:46:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Chevy before that I would think that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>would want something fast.</v>

2459
01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that I uh,</v>

2460
01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I bought my first car in the last car I</v>
<v Speaker 4>bought.</v>

2461
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Long time ago I bought a Mercedes ml 63</v>

2462
01:46:23.751 --> 01:46:25.760
<v Speaker 4>amg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a suv,</v>

2463
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:28.400
<v Speaker 4>souped up suv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a long time ago.</v>

2464
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:30.770
<v Speaker 4>That was like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2465
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:32.960
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought a range rover.</v>

2466
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 4>So since then you've just been using</v>
<v Speaker 4>manufacturer across from the sponsors</v>

2467
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.530
<v Speaker 4>because they're free dollars and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2468
01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever is free.</v>

2469
01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Is Free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that like a part of the contract like</v>

2470
01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:45.170
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only car you're allowed to drive?</v>

2471
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2472
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 4>but that's the only drive in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>racetrack.</v>

2473

<v Speaker 4>But other drivers have other cars too.</v>

2476
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.660
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that once you retire</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will start like going,</v>

2477
01:47:00.730 --> 01:47:01.670

<v Speaker 4>Do you know who you are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not in a race car driver woman.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how many cylinders are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in things.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just drive.</v>

2484
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm just good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know how many cylinders?</v>

2485
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:26.820
<v Speaker 4>I think we have eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

2486
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:30.300
<v Speaker 4>I just lost so many fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you be such a good driver and</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't need to.</v>

2488
01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't build it.</v>

2489
01:47:34.710 --> 01:47:36.390

<v Speaker 4>It's just more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have a Bronco,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's not that fast,</v>

2510
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just feeds your testosterone.</v>

2511
01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanical feel.</v>

2512
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.680
<v Speaker 4>It's analog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2513
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 4>I just like my car to be good off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

2514
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.820
<v Speaker 4>I bought a Lamborghini along while back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2515
01:48:32.890 --> 01:48:34.950
<v Speaker 4>it didn't have a cup holder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>

2516
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.740
<v Speaker 4>well this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not practical.</v>

2517
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I bought the Mercedes and that</v>

2518
01:48:43.561 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 4>had a couple older couple of cup</v>
<v Speaker 4>holders.</v>

2519
01:48:45.601 --> 01:48:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was good,</v>

2520
01:48:46.501 --> 01:48:47.550
<v Speaker 4>but then it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2521
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:50.730
<v Speaker 4>technology evolved and it didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bluetooth to play my music.</v>

2522
01:48:50.731 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I'm not going to have to get rid of</v>

2523
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:55.710
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was when I started driving for</v>

2524
01:48:55.711 --> 01:48:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Chevy and then I got to Tahoe and I like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2525
01:48:57.601 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 4>And then I got a chevy and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>give you a corvette.</v>

2526
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.910
<v Speaker 4>I didn't ask for one.</v>

2527
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:08.940
<v Speaker 4>How could you not want one driving force</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a practical car?</v>

2528
01:49:08.941 --> 01:49:13.320
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted a corvette I could buy one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're good.</v>

2529
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.000
<v Speaker 4>But I would say be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2530
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.140
<v Speaker 4>hook it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

2531
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:21.660
<v Speaker 4>Come on girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went though.</v>

2532
01:49:21.661 --> 01:49:23.610
<v Speaker 4>I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I keep wanting to catch you in that lie.</v>

2533
01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:24.361
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2534
01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2535
01:49:25.711 --> 01:49:28.020
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have cars or like purses for me.</v>

2536
01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:29.100
<v Speaker 4>I just need one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice one.</v>

2537
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.540
<v Speaker 4>And where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get a new one.</v>

2538
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:33.160
<v Speaker 4>You don't like purses?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

2539
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 4>Just needed one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks good.</v>

2540
01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:38.790
<v Speaker 4>And</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about shoes?</v>

2541
01:49:39.190 --> 01:49:41.310
<v Speaker 4>I like shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of shoes.</v>

2542
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:45.210
<v Speaker 4>You're a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely a girl,</v>

2543
01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 4>but not purses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about a curl?</v>

2544
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.430
<v Speaker 2>My own hair today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

2545
01:49:49.431 --> 01:49:50.780
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you do makeup?</v>

2546
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder hurt</v>

2547
01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:53.473
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

2548
01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Hairspray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this stuff now?</v>

2549
01:49:57.951 --> 01:49:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>

2550
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.470
<v Speaker 2>That's what if people ask me what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it about you that people would</v>

2551
01:50:03.471 --> 01:50:06.920
<v Speaker 2>be surprised and I'm telling them like</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more girly away from the track than</v>

2552
01:50:06.921 --> 01:50:09.770
<v Speaker 2>you'd think because I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive at the track and I don't look</v>

2553
01:50:09.771 --> 01:50:12.050
<v Speaker 2>very happy and away from the track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

2554
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I try and be funny and I smile more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more relaxed.</v>

2555
01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Are you surprised that with all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>success and all the attention that</v>

2556
01:50:21.921 --> 01:50:26.921
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten from your success as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only woman on your level in professional</v>

2557
01:50:27.651 --> 01:50:29.890
<v Speaker 1>racing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you surprised that more women aren't</v>

2558
01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:32.090
<v Speaker 1>entering in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't like sort of opened the</v>

2559
01:50:32.091 --> 01:50:37.091
<v Speaker 1>door or do you think that it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized and unique thing to do that</v>

2560
01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women gravitate towards?</v>

2561
01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I used to say that for 100 men that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

2562
01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:47.570
<v Speaker 2>if you found a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes 100 to find a good one that</v>

2563
01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.810
<v Speaker 2>comes pretty quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to go through 100 women takes a lot</v>

2564
01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:55.190
<v Speaker 2>longer because there are so few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more coming through,</v>

2565
01:50:55.191 --> 01:50:56.310
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2566
01:50:56.311 --> 01:50:59.180
<v Speaker 2>over time it just takes a lot longer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find good ones,</v>

2567
01:50:59.181 --> 01:51:00.530
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2568
01:51:00.531 --> 01:51:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back to,</v>

2569
01:51:03.681 --> 01:51:04.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my ego talking.</v>

2570
01:51:04.941 --> 01:51:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I think back to a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2571
01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:12.260
<v Speaker 2>when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Newman was still alive and we were</v>

2572
01:51:12.261 --> 01:51:14.060
<v Speaker 2>on a late night show to the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably Letterman,</v>

2573
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:18.170
<v Speaker 2>and he was asked before I went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the first guest if there was</v>

2574
01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.720
<v Speaker 2>going to be another driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another girl that comes through that</v>

2575
01:51:20.721 --> 01:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>compares to me and he said he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so</v>

2576
01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe there won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there will be no shit.</v>

2577
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew his shit.</v>

2578
01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2579
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you're unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there will be some day I meet a</v>

2580
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:37.120
<v Speaker 1>lot of women like you because of mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2581
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 1>there's those savages that enter into</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>

2582
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:45.270
<v Speaker 1>The women that wind up fighting in MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them and I'm kind of</v>

2583
01:51:46.451 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 1>stunned at how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I say they're like you,</v>

2584
01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

2585
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 1>unique people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does take wild chances.</v>

2586
01:51:57.881 --> 01:52:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean the type of person that is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly home or something like that,</v>

2587
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:04.250
<v Speaker 2>so I think the big difference lies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that are</v>

2588
01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:05.270
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

2589
01:52:05.271 --> 01:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assertive,</v>

2590
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:11.270
<v Speaker 2>bold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to then be able to keep it together</v>

2591
01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:15.940
<v Speaker 2>and I'm up up above their shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another,</v>

2592
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it together in the pressure of a</v>

2593
01:52:19.521 --> 01:52:20.354
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2594
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And the pressure of whatever moment or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tablet you're having,</v>

2595
01:52:22.881 --> 01:52:26.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever pressures are being put on you</v>
<v Speaker 2>around an event or for one.</v>

2596
01:52:26.630 --> 01:52:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really hard.</v>

2597
01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:33.950
<v Speaker 2>The right people around you being able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to filter the shit and lead in like keep</v>

2598
01:52:33.951 --> 01:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your own confidence up.</v>

2599
01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.740
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>

2600
01:52:40.190 --> 01:52:43.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the hardest part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then being able to flip that switch</v>

2601
01:52:43.161 --> 01:52:46.520
<v Speaker 2>when you're performing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course then not have doubts,</v>

2602
01:52:46.521 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 2>but I'm more confidence.</v>

2603
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I think everything that you said would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be mirrored by what a woman who competes</v>

2604
01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:56.630
<v Speaker 1>at the very highest levels of MMA would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

2605
01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would find all those things to be</v>

2606
01:53:00.261 --> 01:53:01.550
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:02.041
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2608
01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm really stunned that you literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the only one.</v>

2609
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2610
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a incredibly rare position.</v>

2611
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever stop and think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you weren't there?</v>

2612
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's forbidden for women.</v>

2613
01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've mostly only thought about it from</v>

2614
01:53:18.791 --> 01:53:23.110
<v Speaker 2>the perspective of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have I thought about what I've done in</v>

2615
01:53:23.111 --> 01:53:28.111
<v Speaker 2>the sport because it's stuff that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done before and usually my</v>

2616
01:53:28.301 --> 01:53:31.690
<v Speaker 2>answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that someday I'll look back and be</v>

2617
01:53:31.691 --> 01:53:33.640
<v Speaker 2>able to have a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on it,</v>

2618
01:53:33.641 --> 01:53:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but right now just to kind of in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of it.</v>

2619
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.553
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2620
01:53:37.230 --> 01:53:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about it like that.</v>

2621
01:53:38.671 --> 01:53:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Like what if I was never there?</v>

2622
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2623
01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were never there,</v>

2624
01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just be constantly a boys club</v>

2625
01:53:47.891 --> 01:53:48.940
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2626
01:53:49.530 --> 01:53:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2627
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm really fascinated by complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>outliers and you're a complete outlier</v>

2628
01:53:54.821 --> 01:53:56.350
<v Speaker 1>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2629
01:53:56.351 --> 01:53:58.720
<v Speaker 1>there's not like 30 girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2630
01:53:58.721 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 1>there's 500 man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's 30 girls know how many men</v>

2631
01:54:02.351 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>are Nascar drivers?</v>

2632
01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the field is 40.</v>

2633
01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 40 men one check.</v>

2634
01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a bunch of people that</v>

2635
01:54:10.971 --> 01:54:13.820
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are there any women that are</v>

2636
01:54:13.821 --> 01:54:14.560
<v Speaker 1>trying</v>

2637
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 2>our formula is others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some that do some part time stuff.</v>

2638
01:54:17.671 --> 01:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to think of someone has</v>
<v Speaker 2>done like a full season.</v>

2639
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in indy car there was some girls</v>

2640
01:54:26.521 --> 01:54:29.720
<v Speaker 2>who did more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were at one,</v>

2641
01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:31.650
<v Speaker 2>one indy 500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like five of us.</v>

2642
01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.050
<v Speaker 2>But most of the time there's none</v>

2643
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:35.230
<v Speaker 5>or one</v>

2644
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>comes in waves.</v>

2645
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean do you think that when you stop</v>

2646
01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:48.160
<v Speaker 1>and you look back in your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll take into account and maybe have</v>

2647
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:52.340
<v Speaker 1>a more objective sense of what an impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've had?</v>

2648
01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I need distance from it.</v>

2649
01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I need to gain perspective that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

2650
01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:06.600
<v Speaker 2>Does sharing your career too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I mean to be able to identify the</v>

2651
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:09.600
<v Speaker 2>things that you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the influence you've had over people</v>

2652
01:55:09.601 --> 01:55:11.700
<v Speaker 2>with the conversations you've had with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2653
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.750
<v Speaker 2>with the things in business you've done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's hard to see when you're in</v>

2654
01:55:15.751 --> 01:55:17.660
<v Speaker 2>the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to look at that</v>

2656
01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.560
<v Speaker 2>because I want to get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people don't in the moment</v>

2657
01:55:25.561 --> 01:55:26.520
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't matter.</v>

2658
01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm what I'm doing.</v>

2659
01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:30.780
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are doing what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is very.</v>

2660
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It just tends to be a woman that does</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that many men think is</v>

2661
01:55:36.811 --> 01:55:39.960
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most manly things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do other than fighting and</v>

2662
01:55:39.961 --> 01:55:42.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A race car driver,</v>

2663
01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>like a little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you want</v>

2664
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.770
<v Speaker 3>to be when you grew up building?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a race car driver,</v>

2665
01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 3>but that's just lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Queen.</v>

2666
01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like a natural thing for men</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gravitate</v>

2667
01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.040
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Dad always said he was just like,</v>

2668
01:55:55.041 --> 01:55:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cursed with three girls in the house.</v>

2669
01:55:58.101 --> 01:56:00.020
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom and then me and my sister and I'm</v>

2670
01:56:00.021 --> 01:56:00.460
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2671
01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what more did you want?</v>

2672
01:56:01.930 --> 01:56:03.000
<v Speaker 3>Like what more did you want with</v>

2673
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you had a boy as a son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what was he going to do that's</v>

2674
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>cooler than what I'm doing?</v>

2675
01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:10.670
<v Speaker 1>He'd be out there banging chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's missing.</v>

2676
01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 2>You think my dad would think that was</v>

2677
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:17.450
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If his son was banging chicks?</v>

2678
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I would think probably that's my boy.</v>

2679
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Scared shitless for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think still in my adult life.</v>

2681
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:28.944
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

2682
01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:34.000
<v Speaker 1>they had the courage to let you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>England by herself when you were 16.</v>

2683
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that and race over there on</v>
<v Speaker 1>another continent all the way across an</v>

2684
01:56:38.681 --> 01:56:41.110
<v Speaker 1>ocean sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did get hurt to get to.</v>

2685
01:56:41.111 --> 01:56:42.400
<v Speaker 1>You would take forever.</v>

2686
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bold.</v>

2687
01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.190
<v Speaker 2>What is the worst crash you've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in?</v>

2688
01:56:48.730 --> 01:56:52.760
<v Speaker 2>My first crash in Indycar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my very first race kind of paralleled</v>

2689
01:56:52.761 --> 01:56:54.830
<v Speaker 2>getting in a go kart for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a big crash.</v>

2690
01:56:54.831 --> 01:56:57.990
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was homestead Miami and uh,</v>

2691
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:02.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a big accident and I was running</v>
<v Speaker 2>low and someone was sliding down the</v>

2692
01:57:02.511 --> 01:57:06.650
<v Speaker 2>track that had damage and they clipped</v>
<v Speaker 2>my right rear and shot me up into the</v>

2693
01:57:06.651 --> 01:57:11.651
<v Speaker 2>wall headfirst and</v>
<v Speaker 2>slid down the track and I don't remember</v>

2694
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:13.700
<v Speaker 2>that part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember getting out.</v>

2695
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:15.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember walking to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambulance,</v>

2696
01:57:15.441 --> 01:57:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's footage of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked the wrong way away from the</v>

2697
01:57:19.221 --> 01:57:21.800
<v Speaker 2>ambulance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was walking the opposite direction and</v>

2698
01:57:21.801 --> 01:57:26.150
<v Speaker 2>then I was kind of stumbling around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got back to the back to the</v>

2699
01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:30.290
<v Speaker 2>medical truck and then I got in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently I was very repetitive on the</v>

2700
01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:34.400
<v Speaker 2>way to the hospital and I kept asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>them did it look bad?</v>

2701
01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've asked us to add a few times.</v>

2702
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.940
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2703
01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2704
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:43.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a severe concussion.</v>

2705
01:57:43.431 --> 01:57:46.490
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people ask the same questions over</v>

2706
01:57:46.491 --> 01:57:47.324
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

2707
01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I've had one.</v>

2708
01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Let's hope I don't have a cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you probably do.</v>

2709
01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2710
01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That touch matter makes you more risky.</v>

2711
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Why does it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2712
01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of thing.</v>

2713
01:58:01.601 --> 01:58:03.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the things it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes people more impulsive.</v>

2714
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Do UFC people get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2715
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:09.490
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video?</v>

2716
01:58:09.491 --> 01:58:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they doing studies in UFC like they</v>

2717
01:58:11.431 --> 01:58:16.200
<v Speaker 2>did in the nfl with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing tests after they've passed</v>

2718
01:58:16.201 --> 01:58:20.710
<v Speaker 2>away to know if they had cte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that would nfl had they like,</v>

2719
01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a study that came out last</v>

2720
01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.870
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like almost all but one out of</v>

2721
01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:26.580
<v Speaker 2>100 and some had cte.</v>

2722
01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:27.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2723
01:58:27.970 --> 01:58:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I forget the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2724
01:58:29.381 --> 01:58:31.420
<v Speaker 1>there was only like one or two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have.</v>

2725
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:34.210
<v Speaker 1>It</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done that.</v>

2726
01:58:34.211 --> 01:58:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Doc hasn't been around as long as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NFL obviously.</v>

2727
01:58:36.491 --> 01:58:40.600
<v Speaker 1>So we were not dealing with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>data pool,</v>

2728
01:58:40.601 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure when people</v>

2729
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.460
<v Speaker 3>do pass away we're going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just varying levels.</v>

2730
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I heard they actually have a test now</v>
<v Speaker 3>for cte.</v>

2731
01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a trauma surgeon that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're alive.</v>

2732
01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:57.550
<v Speaker 3>What would you do if you had it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make excuses.</v>

2733
01:58:58.030 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 3>I just go extra crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2734
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.200
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naked</v>

2735
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 3>bottle of whiskey in each arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chug,</v>

2736
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Chug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pals.</v>

2737
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>So insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This question,</v>

2738
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:19.720
<v Speaker 3>did you see the video that just came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a couple of days ago from the guy</v>

2739
01:59:19.721 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 3>that hit the off ramp and went flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air and landed in a house in</v>

2740
01:59:23.861 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the second floor of a house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His car's poking out the side,</v>

2741
01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't do it again if he had to.</v>

2742
01:59:29.231 --> 01:59:30.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2743
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.240
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just total random.</v>

2744
01:59:31.241 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Crazy luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is hilarious.</v>

2745
01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I made</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see if you.</v>

2746
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Once you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go then go to Christa.</v>

2747
01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Lee is instagram because Taleah had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious meme that he created,</v>

2748
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.910
<v Speaker 3>but this car hit this hit like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier.</v>

2749
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Hit one of those cement barriers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally got launched into the air and</v>

2750
01:59:52.961 --> 01:59:56.050
<v Speaker 3>stuck into the second floor of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>building and.</v>

2751
01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what country was this in?</v>

2752
02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.093
<v Speaker 3>Morocco?</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2753
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Margo to people escape the injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serious injuries.</v>

2754
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:07.600
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wonder how they got out of the</v>

2755
02:00:07.601 --> 02:00:08.720
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2756
02:00:08.721 --> 02:00:11.380
<v Speaker 3>it's the way it's hanging out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

2757
02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully it's front wheel drive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could keep accelerating to get a</v>

2758
02:00:14.591 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 3>little further in so they can get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the car that's spoken like a true race</v>

2759
02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:19.630

2834
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:24.280
<v Speaker 4>I would say something american,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something american made cars tend to</v>

2835
02:03:24.281 --> 02:03:26.110
<v Speaker 4>die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if they are or aren't</v>

2836
02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:30.370
<v Speaker 4>really why I have a porsche I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like german cars too.</v>

2837
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:33.160
<v Speaker 4>They're more reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I like about american cars is I</v>

2838
02:03:33.161 --> 02:03:35.980
<v Speaker 4>like the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way they just is a rumble</v>

2839
02:03:35.981 --> 02:03:39.370
<v Speaker 4>throatiness to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it you like to like.</v>

2840
02:03:39.371 --> 02:03:42.640
<v Speaker 4>So you like to make noise on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a loud person.</v>

2841
02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a 65 corvette with straight</v>

2842
02:03:46.631 --> 02:03:50.380
<v Speaker 4>pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those pipes kind of know what that is.</v>

2843
02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.920
<v Speaker 4>I can picture it kind of race car</v>
<v Speaker 4>driver,</v>

2844
02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.730
<v Speaker 4>but it's a step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's important.</v>

2845
02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:56.493
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2846
02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.600
<v Speaker 4>don't care,</v>

2847
02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:01.590
<v Speaker 3>but I would feel like where someone like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2848
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:04.950
<v Speaker 3>once you transitioned away from racing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's going to be more important to</v>

2849
02:04:04.951 --> 02:04:07.770
<v Speaker 3>you because you're gonna miss the</v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities of those things.</v>

2850
02:04:07.770 --> 02:04:10.140
<v Speaker 4>That might be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be true.</v>

2851
02:04:10.141 --> 02:04:11.170
<v Speaker 4>I might have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I also don't really like old cars,</v>

2857
02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:22.381
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's pretty fancy looking.</v>

2859
02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:26.040
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I like new modern sports cars.</v>

2862
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I do as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that car is a 65 on the outside,</v>

2863
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:38.490
<v Speaker 3>but all the underpinnings are completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern as a [inaudible] supercharged</v>

2864
02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:41.230
<v Speaker 3>engine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it does a modern corvette engine.</v>

2865
02:04:41.231 --> 02:04:43.830
<v Speaker 3>It's got modern brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern suspension.</v>

2866
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what any of that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

<v Speaker 2>my mustang cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove it so hard that I needed an</v>

2870
02:04:51.361 --> 02:04:53.720
<v Speaker 2>8,000 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on my third set of brakes.</v>

2871
02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we put stiffer sway bars in it so that</v>

2872
02:04:59.881 --> 02:05:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it would handle better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2873
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.600
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it was back when they were more cool</v>

2884
02:05:23.610 --> 02:05:26.550
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were a lot less common.</v>

2885
02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were okay.</v>

2886
02:05:28.901 --> 02:05:31.250

<v Speaker 2>The corvette was tight,</v>

2923
02:06:57.921 --> 02:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>which meant it was the most comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stable to drive.</v>

02:09:55.991 --> 02:09:57.670
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck is angelina?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody be like,</v>

2992
02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like this local celebrity.</v>

2993
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And so she apparently is just a wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady who uh,</v>

2994
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:09.370
<v Speaker 3>all of her time here has done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got these big biLlboards.</v>

2995
02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing a split on top of a corvette</v>

2996
02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:17.240
<v Speaker 3>grand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good thing for her?</v>

2997
02:10:17.241 --> 02:10:22.241
<v Speaker 3>Maybe she kept doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she still does it right.</v>

2998
02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:23.530
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still have a billboard?</v>

2999
02:10:23.650 --> 02:10:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Not a billboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

3000
02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:27.490
<v Speaker 3>she has at least three different print</v>
<v Speaker 3>corvettes and I've seen,</v>

3001
02:10:27.550 --> 02:10:30.250
<v Speaker 3>I've seen her really recently in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink corvette.</v>

3002
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not me.</v>

3003
02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:33.593
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

3004
02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:35.330
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more like,</v>

3005
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of your subdue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually when I got the lamborghini and</v>

3006
02:10:39.330 --> 02:10:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I had to go pick my sister up from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>

3007
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere to put your.</v>

3008
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Put your bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a briefcase for,</v>

3009
02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:53.110
<v Speaker 2>for a trunk and it's in the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of silly and then I</v>

3010
02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:57.740
<v Speaker 2>realized that people normally get these</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars so they can just kind of take it</v>

3011
02:10:57.741 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 2>out to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be looked at so I'm not</v>

3012
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more likely to take it to go get</v>

3013
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>groceries than I am to go to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I realized it was pretty pointless</v>

3014
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:08.220
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3015
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 2>that's not the car for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I want performance I go do my job</v>

3016
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:14.680
<v Speaker 3>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For now.</v>

3017
02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:16.510
<v Speaker 3>But when it's over it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm trying to look.</v>

3018
02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to keep trying to sell me</v>
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>

3019
02:11:17.911 --> 02:11:19.300
<v Speaker 3>You're looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3020
02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward after these next two</v>
<v Speaker 3>races.</v>

3021
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.490
<v Speaker 2>We'll have to visit again in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year from now and.</v>

3022
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And have to figure this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it all out.</v>

3023
02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.350
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you,</v>

3024
02:11:29.351 --> 02:11:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

3025
02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Well a year from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the new corvette,</v>

3026
02:11:32.591 --> 02:11:37.150
<v Speaker 3>zr one will be available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>750 horsepower.</v>

3027
02:11:37.210 --> 02:11:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Stupid two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to use it.</v>

3028
02:11:41.411 --> 02:11:44.020
<v Speaker 3>So you might use the zero 1650 speeding</v>
<v Speaker 3>tickets.</v>

3029
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:45.500
<v Speaker 3>So he talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

3030
02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

3031
02:11:48.071 --> 02:11:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Ain't nobody got a speeding ticket for</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the speed limit to quickly</v>

3032
02:11:50.521 --> 02:11:51.690
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3033
02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:52.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3034
02:11:52.531 --> 02:11:53.960
<v Speaker 2>they probably would pull you over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3035
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:57.930
<v Speaker 2>funny story about when I got pulled over</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 16 with my mustang cobra,</v>

3036
02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I was picking my girlfriend up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling out of her,</v>

3037
02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:05.730
<v Speaker 2>her off of her straight onto the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>street and it was wet out and so I kinda</v>

3038
02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.970
<v Speaker 2>got it going and kicked it sideways a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and looked in my rear view</v>

3039
02:12:08.971 --> 02:12:11.310
<v Speaker 2>mirror at the stoplight and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop sitting there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well he comes for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I Turned on the first road I can</v>

3055
02:12:42.211 --> 02:12:45.320
<v Speaker 2>road again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get further away from the stop</v>

3056
02:12:45.321 --> 02:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a left.</v>

3057
02:12:46.531 --> 02:12:48.990
<v Speaker 2>I look over in the parking lot across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>

3058
02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.350
<v Speaker 2>the grade school parking lot cops</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>

02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.760
<v Speaker 2>So I make the first right I can then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I turned right into a neighborhood</v>

3060
02:12:56.761 --> 02:12:58.980
<v Speaker 2>and I'm driving along and he finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>catches me in.</v>

3061
02:12:59.030 --> 02:13:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I cried to help me.</v>

3062
02:13:01.410 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 3>He didn't turn his lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you were running from him kinda</v>

3063
02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.030
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like a shitty driver,</v>

3064
02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.470
<v Speaker 3>like a shitty cop,</v>

3065
02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think I got in trouble for being</v>
<v Speaker 2>sideways.</v>

3066
02:13:11.981 --> 02:13:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Not for speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3067
02:13:14.681 --> 02:13:15.470
<v Speaker 2>You should say</v>

3068
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:16.920
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So your friend's car.</v>

3069
02:13:16.921 --> 02:13:18.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know how to drive this</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

3070
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:22.370
<v Speaker 2>ben.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually a clever approach.</v>

3071
02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3072
02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:24.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>

3073
02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit the gas and one side was my</v>

3074
02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:30.220
<v Speaker 2>getting pulled over three times in three</v>
<v Speaker 2>days episodes.</v>

3075
02:13:30.221 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>So that was number three.</v>

3076
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.950
<v Speaker 4>I think I cried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was number two.</v>

3077
02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 4>So is that why you were running from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops?</v>

3078
02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:37.320
<v Speaker 4>liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just can't.</v>

3079
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:40.020
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just trying to see if I can</v>

3080
02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 4>get away.</v>
