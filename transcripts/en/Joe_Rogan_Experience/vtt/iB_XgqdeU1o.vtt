00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You're an intense lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of intensity when I met</v>

7
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you like right away I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Got to take this one in.</v>

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 2>it's the handshake and then it's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when someone actually looks you</v>

11
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 2>in the eye.</v>

12
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to be intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you do for living is</v>

13
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:25.840
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the craziest things a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being can do.</v>

14
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so it's up there for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fast you go?</v>

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>

16
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

17
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar's top speed is probably two 15</v>

18
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 2>indy cars and maybe more like two 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to do the Daytona 500 next</v>

19
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 2>month and then the indy 500 in May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

20
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are going to be my last two races.</v>

21
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>the last one's ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

23
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.673
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my Danica double goodbye tour.</v>

25
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you doing a Danica Double</v>

26
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye Cook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it enough is enough.</v>

27
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love racing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love other things too.</v>

29
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with transitioning out and</v>

31
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of things that were kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just pointing me in this direction.</v>

32
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2017 stuff that has never happened to</v>

33
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>me before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

34
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 2>to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

35
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Head towards the exit a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm good with that.</v>

36
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very decisive person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

37
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably one of them that I</v>

38
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 2>thought about a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

39
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 2>as far as like how to be done or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if to be done I guess.</v>

40
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:30.490
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 2>the how was the hardest part?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My agent kept calling and saying,</v>

42
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 2>what about this and what if you did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

43
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

44
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

45
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 2>You all need to get ready for me to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

46
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

47
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.011
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>so then he came up with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

49
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>what if you finish up at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Daytona for the 500?</v>

50
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the indy 500?</v>

51
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was really only referring to the</v>

52
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>indy 500.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

53
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 2>well I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love you to do both.</v>

54
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well that's a good idea.</v>

55
00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing in racing called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>double,</v>

57
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 2>which is doing the indy 500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 2>on Memorial Day weekend on Sunday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then flying straight to charlotte to do</v>

59
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the coke 600 afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of known as the double.</v>

60
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what we're calling the</v>

61
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Danica double and it has to do with just</v>
<v Speaker 2>having spent,</v>

62
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chunk of my career in Indycar and a</v>

63
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 2>chunk of my career in Nascar and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda feels like the right way to go</v>

64
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.441
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

65
00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:21.101
<v Speaker 2>It didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did,</v>

66
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit of a murky end as far as</v>

67
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen?</v>

68
00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to race next year full time</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not?</v>

69
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And it just kind of went suit too long</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to have like a proper,</v>

70
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm done sort of moment in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was just a great way to do it.</v>

71
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that things happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 that didn't happen before?</v>

72
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.903
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean?</v>

73
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I got a sponsor leave me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

74
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 2>my primary sponsor left at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the year.</v>

75
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I may not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I signed a contract it when mercury was</v>

76
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>in retrograde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

77
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I screwed myself there.</v>

78
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 2>But that stuff don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

79
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>It was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

80
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe the universe is a little</v>

81
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.240
<v Speaker 2>bit straight</v>

82
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Speaker 3>forward than we think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of good things probably happened</v>

83
00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>during that time just in 2017 or during</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard,</v>

84
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Shereen Mercury in retrograde.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

85
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

86
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 3>I think people look for some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hidden meaning to things when it</v>

87
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 3>comes to like astrology.</v>

88
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I do try and understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite,</v>

90
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to understand how it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters,</v>

91
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some things,</v>

92
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 2>at least with the moon that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the water changes with the moon,</v>

93
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 2>so doesn't that mean that other thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>should too,</v>

94
00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 2>whether it be energetically or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

95
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I think the the water and the moon thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of makes sense a little bit.</v>

96
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 3>A little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's probably just like</v>

97
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 3>barely one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just still,</v>

98
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.490
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a whisper on the wind kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

99
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stop putting my crystals outside of</v>

100
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 3>charge under the full moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not so important.</v>

101
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.070
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some something someone sent me</v>

102
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 3>about the army using crystals and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

103
00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 3>this has gotta be like an onion article</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the rn,</v>

104
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 3>the army was using crystals for like</v>
<v Speaker 3>medic seat thing.</v>

105
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 3>If you could see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find that.</v>

106
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Define it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 3>This store for wounded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Look at this stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even,</v>

109
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if it's real.</v>

110
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 3>US Army's new holistic medics treating</v>
<v Speaker 3>gunshot wounds with crystals and</v>

111
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 3>essential oils is satire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

112
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew essential oils.</v>

113
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think there's a plant that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cures everything out there?</v>

114
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 3>There probably is something like that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon.</v>

115
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.540
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not cures everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is probably a lot of stuff that</v>

116
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:34.140
<v Speaker 3>we oils come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

117
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pair that up with some high</v>

118
00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:40.340
<v Speaker 3>vibrational stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high vibrational stones.</v>

119
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

120
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.040
<v Speaker 3>no tents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

121
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to back to my sponsor leaving me.</v>

122
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 3>You sponsor leaving you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will like,</v>

123
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:48.470
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never happened to me before.</v>

125
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I've always been someone that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well funded and I always had a</v>

126
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 2>sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always had a sponsor and never a</v>

127
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

128
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

129
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 2>it was just things like that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

130
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I got an a few big wrecks in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like probably three and six weeks that</v>

131
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:05.614
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

132
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was bawling in the medical center</v>

133
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.510
<v Speaker 2>after the third one going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

134
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running like top 10,</v>

135
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 2>and a car blew a rotor and clipped me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put me in the wall.</v>

136
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I was on fire up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another driver broke his back.</v>

137
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a huge accident.</v>

138
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

139
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>what is the message?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is someone trying to tell me right</v>

140
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:25.354
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

141
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I collected my shit and got my</v>

142
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>face looking like halfway decent to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to the media out there,</v>

143
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I finally got out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

144
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 2>just stuff like that was happening and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

145
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I was in a very go with the flow mood in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 I wasn't pushing for anything cause</v>

146
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really sure what I wanted so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let the universe take care of it.</v>

147
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 3>You've got a very interesting way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things.</v>

148
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 3>You when things go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

149
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.180
<v Speaker 3>what is the universe trying to tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like,</v>

150
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 3>well I drive really fucking fast for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

151
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes shit goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's happens to I,</v>

152
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.123
<v Speaker 3>it seems like</v>

153
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>car racing is just inherently crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's what I was saying when I was</v>

154
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>saying you do one of the craziest things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can for a living going 240 miles an</v>

155
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.470
<v Speaker 1>hour is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And metal and rubber and things just,</v>

157
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust in something when you're out there</v>

158
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:14.920
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

159
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>200 plus miles an hour with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.030
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't your friends around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you with walls around you as well.</v>

161
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of got to put your trust in</v>

162
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:25.534
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

163
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was getting at that because</v>

164
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the way you think is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

165
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar to the way fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilots think.</v>

166
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Fighter pilots have a lot of weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitions and a lot of,</v>

167
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pilots do,</v>

168
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense things.</v>

169
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like in order to get through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

170
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the task at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost have to delegate certain</v>

171
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:52.740
<v Speaker 1>aspects of reality to fate or to chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>

172
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

173
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

174
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

175
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.750
<v Speaker 2>have a tattoo on my back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his in America,</v>

176
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 2>it's an American flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that when I was 19.</v>

177
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like an American flag that fades to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a checkered flag.</v>

178
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.790
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I got that when I was 19.</v>

179
00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Then when I was about 27,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went and got the rest,</v>

180
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:09.850
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

181
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Angel Wings and some stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

182
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it's not the most beautiful piece of</v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

183
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 2>but it means something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be really beautiful in 30</v>

184
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure 40 um,</v>

185
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

187
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I would definitely pray that,</v>

188
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taken care of and you've got to</v>

189
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:32.341
<v Speaker 2>hand that off and just go do your damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>job and not be afraid and just trust in</v>

190
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:34.240
<v Speaker 2>the fate of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>

191
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of where the angel links,</v>

192
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people that do inherently</v>

193
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.361
<v Speaker 1>risky things oftentimes look for signs</v>
<v Speaker 1>or look for some sort of,</v>

194
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some direction,</v>

195
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some message from the university.</v>

196
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.943
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I was,</v>

197
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

198
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as a race car driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this a lot lately and</v>

199
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:58.291
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how much of our job is a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>less even just feeling what's happening</v>

200
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>and how much is actually maybe more</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive.</v>

201
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're,</v>

202
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're having more intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what's going on and</v>

203
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we realize we just are so,</v>

204
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's happening so fast and that</v>

205
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

206
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 2>you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

207
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:16.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have really good feel.</v>

208
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

209
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's some of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

210
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:25.480
<v Speaker 2>so I think that maybe maybe you're maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe athletes or people at an elite</v>

211
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:28.870
<v Speaker 2>level are more in touch with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive side that um,</v>

212
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.050
<v Speaker 2>finite like last thread of feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's beyond feel.</v>

213
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.683
<v Speaker 2>It's a knowing</v>

214
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.930
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

215
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've spent involved in that</v>

216
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>intense activity in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

217
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>they say that people get road rage for</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why people get road</v>

218
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:52.801
<v Speaker 1>rage is because when you're driving you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are reacting to things that could happen</v>

219
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your at a very heightened state and</v>

220
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:57.980
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.910
<v Speaker 1>someone cuts you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

222
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>they start freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like instantly they go from one to 10</v>

223
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is because they're always</v>

224
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>at seven and they don't even realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're at seven.</v>

225
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>When you were in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably at like 13.</v>

226
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.960
<v Speaker 2>This one goes to 11.</v>

227
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

228
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're cranked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

229
00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:19.010
<v Speaker 1>And so you're probably seeing things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling things at the average person.</v>

230
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't experience in their life.</v>

231
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just working at that top little</v>

232
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.950
<v Speaker 2>top level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of,</v>

233
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.280
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>

234
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

235
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that where you call it in the zone?</v>

236
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it kind of almost becomes slightly</v>

237
00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 2>out of body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how it's happening.</v>

238
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:42.214
<v Speaker 2>It's just happening.</v>

239
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Why would imagine like you kind of melt</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and you're just coming.</v>

240
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We involved,</v>

241
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.340
<v Speaker 2>when I think about what I have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say as an example coming in</v>

242
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>for a pit stop and you got your throttle</v>
<v Speaker 2>brake,</v>

243
00:09:53.981 --> 00:09:56.320
<v Speaker 2>clutch gears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things that you have</v>

244
00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

245
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.490
<v Speaker 2>to think about it logically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have to do is so much more</v>

246
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 2>confusing than just going on instinct of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just do it.</v>

247
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you have to,</v>

248
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use,</v>

249
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you only have two feet but you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>three pedals and you have to use all</v>

250
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 2>three pedals at some point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you want to be ready for everything</v>

251
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:15.490
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming in like what the clutch in</v>

252
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.620
<v Speaker 2>on the break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you have to get back to the,</v>

253
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.870
<v Speaker 2>get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the throttle just in time.</v>

254
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 2>But you have to have the clutch in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to hold the brakes so you make</v>

255
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:24.130
<v Speaker 2>sure you don't roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of things you have to</v>

256
00:10:24.131 --> 00:10:25.960
<v Speaker 2>do using all three pedals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have two feet.</v>

257
00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:28.330
<v Speaker 2>And so when you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have to think about what you</v>

258
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:29.980
<v Speaker 2>have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more overwhelming than</v>

259
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:32.440
<v Speaker 2>just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you drive a manual in real life?</v>

260
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

261
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

262
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.423
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

263
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean a lot of people,</v>

264
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's kind of a dying</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

265
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

266
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean even indy cars went to paddle</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting before I was done,</v>

267
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 2>it was h pattern and then it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequential gearbox.</v>

268
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 2>And then it was paddle shifting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

269
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>but Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar is still still got the old h</v>

270
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That left leg is important for the whole</v>

271
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 2>feel of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

272
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in an indy car,</v>

273
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 2>in any car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually have a full on dead pedal.</v>

274
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So you have all three pedals and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a dead pedal,</v>

275
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is important because you spend a lot of</v>

276
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 2>time with your foot there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is part of the feel.</v>

277
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely part of the feel of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

278
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 2>especially with all the g loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get involved in racing?</v>

279
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I raced go karts when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

280
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>my sister and my sister wanted to race</v>
<v Speaker 2>go carts and I just didn't want to get</v>

281
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>left out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it turned out I was all right.</v>

282
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It and I kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

283
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a very unusual path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did everything though.</v>

285
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played like coach pitch,</v>

286
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 2>then tee ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the band,</v>

287
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the choir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took voice lessons.</v>

288
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played basketball,</v>

289
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 2>volleyball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheerleading,</v>

290
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played in every sport.</v>

291
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took tumbling classes and then I also</v>

292
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 2>tried racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've always been intense?</v>

293
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

294
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.814
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

295
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you know at a certain age that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be a race car driver?</v>

296
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 10,</v>

297
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I decided that I wanted to go to college</v>
<v Speaker 2>for engineering so I could learn how to</v>

298
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 2>work on my race car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realize I did not have to do that.</v>

299
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought.</v>

301
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to do that.</v>

302
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Be An engineer so that you could work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your race card.</v>

303
00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you understand how crazy that is?</v>

304
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.250
<v Speaker 2>When I was going to be 10 years old to</v>
<v Speaker 2>three thinking that,</v>

305
00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:11.084
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

306
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.613
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

307
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you're born that way or am</v>
<v Speaker 2>I an old?</v>

308
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to be thinking that way when I'm 10</v>

309
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:21.394
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

310
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are just so much different</v>

311
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.200
<v Speaker 2>or more mature further along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

312
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that is?</v>

313
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

314
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory gets transferred through DNA and</v>

315
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:40.590
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long line of adventurous people and</v>

316
00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>their family and that gets transferred</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the DNA of the children.</v>

317
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

318
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I have three children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a spiritual reincarnation.</v>

319
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

320
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

321
00:12:51.501 --> 00:12:52.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

322
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.140
<v Speaker 1>That's entirely possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

323
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I would never say no to that because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're living this life,</v>

324
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody asked to live this life.</v>

325
00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>You just here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if you get to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

327
00:13:03.711 --> 00:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>we're assuming that you don't get to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it again because we're assuming that</v>

328
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 1>time goes on this sort of linear way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it just does for you in this</v>

329
00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:12.560
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that there's</v>

330
00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of lives being lived out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

331
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.140
<v Speaker 1>in infinite timelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all simultaneously.</v>

332
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.020
<v Speaker 1>We're just experiencing this one and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know what happens when we</v>

333
00:13:21.021 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to sleep,</v>

334
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.310
<v Speaker 1>close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for some crazy dream about Godzilla</v>

335
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:26.750
<v Speaker 1>chasing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a skateboard.</v>

336
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.620
<v Speaker 1>You wake up in the morning and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're on the same timeline</v>

337
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that you were on before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:35.330
<v Speaker 1>because you have done the astro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

339
00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the things that's really</v>

341
00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:42.470
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about watching a child</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop from a baby to,</v>

342
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid and see their personalities.</v>

343
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize like there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's just,</v>

344
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 1>that's what they come with.</v>

345
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

346
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.770
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

347
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>they're just different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

348
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

349
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>why was I thinking about being an</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineer when I was 10 years old?</v>

350
00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Why was I brave enough to go live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>England by myself when I was 16 and all</v>

351
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>good with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

352
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

353
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I in tent?</v>

354
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why was I intense when you met me?</v>

355
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:09.903
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

356
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of your intensity is</v>

357
00:14:12.081 --> 00:14:14.210
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had to guess,</v>

358
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 1>if I could be presumptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your a woman involved in a very manly</v>

359
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:23.570
<v Speaker 1>activity and I'm sure men probably test</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in some sort of a weird way.</v>

360
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I bet along the way you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed this sort of like way of</v>

361
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>addressing them right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a listen motherfucker</v>

362
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.303
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

363
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think you probably have to,</v>

364
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:37.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine,</v>

365
00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

366
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>to be strong you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was younger and going</v>

367
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 2>to meetings with companies or team</v>
<v Speaker 2>bosses,</v>

368
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 2>people like that and was the advice</v>
<v Speaker 2>given was don't say,</v>

369
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 2>oh I this and may be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be sure about what you want.</v>

370
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 2>And I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

371
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature versus nurture,</v>

372
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.350
<v Speaker 2>some of it's learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of it's just there.</v>

373
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't turn a timid person to you.</v>

374
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

375
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not likely you would,</v>

376
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you seem to be like this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just who you are.</v>

377
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 3>If you're telling me that at 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old you were thinking about being an</v>

378
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 3>engineer so you could work on race cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not normal.</v>

379
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's normal though?</v>

380
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 3>What'd you want to do when you were 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old?</v>

381
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably wanted to be an artist.</v>

382
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 3>I think I wanted to be an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

383
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 3>that follows this vein sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

384
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 3>But like I used to want to draw comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

385
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

386
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:34.940
<v Speaker 3>So that was probably what I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was never like,</v>

387
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 3>well I need to do is like I need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way to make my hand</v>

388
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 3>stronger so that I draw faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I like</v>

389
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Steven Mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not go to college.</v>

390
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even finish high school.</v>

391
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 2>You didn't at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

392
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I left when I was 16 and I got my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

393
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And I failed the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

394
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 2>You want to know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

396
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's like a horrible,</v>

397
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>like I failed my ged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>

398
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>

399
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 2>the constitution test is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in Illinois,</v>

400
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you have to pass it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>every state,</v>

401
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>but in Illinois you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in eighth grade to go to high</v>

402
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:12.560
<v Speaker 2>school you have to get a 70% or above to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to high school.</v>

403
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I got a 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to high school.</v>

404
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like a 3.5 and above student.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was a's and b's not a problem for</v>

405
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The constitution and government and all</v>

406
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 2>of those sectors and names and holy</v>
<v Speaker 2>moly,</v>

407
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 2>it's so confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

408
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then when it came time to,</v>

411
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 2>constitution test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I prepare for it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just don't sign any contracts.</v>

469
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:41.390
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what a bizarre,</v>

470
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was kind of learning about some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff cause it was quite a few</v>

471
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 2>years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

472
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the next day,</v>

473
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:50.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a year and a half later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

474
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit hit the fan and I was like,</v>

475
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that damn astrologer was right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

476
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Mercury retrogrades pretty standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>information if you're into strategy at</v>

477
00:18:59.631 --> 00:19:00.260
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

478
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

479
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.980
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

480
00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.580
<v Speaker 2>I saw a psychic in Sedona a few years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and she said that professionally</v>

481
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.740
<v Speaker 2>over the next four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life's gonna go boom,</v>

482
00:19:09.741 --> 00:19:10.161
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

483
00:19:10.161 --> 00:19:10.581
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

484
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:11.211
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

485
00:19:11.211 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to win a bunch of races,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be awesome.</v>

486
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:15.350
<v Speaker 2>And instead I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

487
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have clothing line now.</v>

488
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a book that just came out at the</v>

489
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.741
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

490
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:25.310
<v Speaker 2>my wines finally been for sale for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>year now.</v>

491
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's other projects I'm working</v>

492
00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 2>on too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

493
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.400
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finishing off my career in a pretty big</v>

494
00:19:31.401 --> 00:19:33.230
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess she was right.</v>

495
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that lady's full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

496
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.280
<v Speaker 3>I think she looked at you and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chick's gonna kick ass.</v>

497
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she recognized me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then she's like,</v>

498
00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I sat down,</v>

499
00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:42.560
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

500
00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:46.430
<v Speaker 2>the way it works here is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see words or symbols or things</v>

501
00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:49.310
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I just look around like don't</v>

502
00:19:49.311 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 2>think I'm not paying attention to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just how I see things.</v>

503
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:52.664
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

504
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.260
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sitting there and she's telling</v>

505
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:56.480
<v Speaker 2>me all this stuff and she says whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>my job is,</v>

506
00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I travel a lot and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she all of a sudden kind of was</v>

507
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:00.771
<v Speaker 2>looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked over,</v>

508
00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:02.930
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities are you a celebrity?</v>

509
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.110
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only am if you think I am.</v>

510
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Just usually how I answer people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

511
00:20:08.661 --> 00:20:11.780
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she know who I was up in Sedona?</v>

512
00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>They don't watch a lot of TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

513
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

514
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.180
<v Speaker 2>They snake</v>

515
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.090
<v Speaker 3>and when no one's looking at their lunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>break areas,</v>

516
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:22.760
<v Speaker 3>just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of crystals on the TV.</v>

517
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I just think he's sending positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibes.</v>

518
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Almost all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think almost call psychic stuff is</v>

519
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:33.140
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you don't believe in the being</v>

520
00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:35.600
<v Speaker 3>intuitive intuition is a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

521
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I think when people sit down and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

522
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I see you in a past life and you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>handmade and you,</v>

523
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.890
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you work by the river,</v>

524
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.470
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all bullshit.</v>

525
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I think those people are nuts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot</v>

526
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 1>of people that want to think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>special and they want to think that they</v>

527
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>have special gifts in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does.</v>

528
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 1>People get really good at reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

529
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:59.431
<v Speaker 1>I know people who are professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>magicians and they are expert cold</v>

530
00:20:59.471 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could sit down with you and breed and</v>

531
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.990
<v Speaker 1>tell you remarkable amounts of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>

532
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 1>about your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just with your answers to questions,</v>

533
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.550
<v Speaker 1>but they'll tell you right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not psychic.</v>

534
00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a guy named bandit check</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's excellent at it.</v>

535
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does a show in Vegas and he freaks</v>

536
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 1>people out because he'll tell you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

537
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I am not a psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

538
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's techniques to this and it's</v>

539
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 1>something I've been doing my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just get really good at it and</v>

540
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people are con artists.</v>

541
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're con artists.</v>

542
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.760
<v Speaker 1>They trick you into thinking that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

543
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but they might even believe it</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

544
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people calm themselves,</v>

545
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is something like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about someone and they</v>

546
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:40.640
<v Speaker 1>call you like out of nowhere and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't talked,</v>

547
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 2>the prevalence of synchronicities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop up in your life,</v>

548
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:43.511
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

549
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is on TV.</v>

550
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

551
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bizarre connection that we don't</v>

552
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.910
<v Speaker 1>totally understand to events into people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into things</v>

553
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.580
<v Speaker 2>well like attracts like or where</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention goes,</v>

554
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.870
<v Speaker 2>energy flows.</v>

555
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot to that.</v>

556
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Certain magnetism to those two things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bring it together.</v>

557
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

558
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poorly understood and there's a lot</v>

559
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 1>of woo that's clouding it up and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>woo gets in the way of rational,</v>

560
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated people.</v>

561
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Even considering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dismiss it instantaneously because</v>

562
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 1>it's connected to somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes with neon signs.</v>

563
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a card reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>palm reader,</v>

564
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and these people that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just ripping you off.</v>

565
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 1>That's all they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a real job.</v>

566
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk to people for a job and you</v>

567
00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say it's entertainment.</v>

568
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 1>He could say that what they're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're providing you with a service</v>

569
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.660
<v Speaker 1>that serves as they sit down with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

570
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe by telling you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's going to be amazing.</v>

571
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You'll walk out of there with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and then life will be</v>

572
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:48.320
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

573
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.290
<v Speaker 1>You believe that if you think your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life's going to be amazing,</v>

574
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>it will be no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

575
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You get hit by a meteor given me a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the house.</v>

576
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 1>You could fall into a crack in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground from an earthquake.</v>

577
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well those people that died in the</v>

578
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:01.150
<v Speaker 1>tsunami in Thailand did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were they bad people?</v>

579
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:01.820
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

580
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.120
<v Speaker 2>There was there any level of Wu that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth following through on?</v>

581
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some,</v>

582
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.500
<v Speaker 1>some of the connections and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition and some superstitions and</v>

583
00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:17.880
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we have are probably based in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this limited understanding that we have</v>

584
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.390
<v Speaker 1>in the connection that we have two</v>
<v Speaker 1>events and humans in life.</v>

585
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.780
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's also bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved too.</v>

586
00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And all these things get very cloudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's an absolute,</v>

587
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that intuition is</v>

588
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.200
<v Speaker 1>a developing sense that we don't totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>have yet.</v>

589
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I think if you think about all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people can do,</v>

590
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.010
<v Speaker 1>hearing and seeing and touching and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smelling and all the different senses</v>

591
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:44.910
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

592
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 1>that that covers the full gamut of</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

593
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's true.</v>

594
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

595
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

596
00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.530
<v Speaker 2>even just visually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

597
00:23:53.531 --> 00:23:56.800
<v Speaker 2>we don't see the full spectrum of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see a very,</v>

598
00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:59.470
<v Speaker 2>very small amount of things that are out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

599
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our audio as well,</v>

600
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't hear all the sounds.</v>

601
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:03.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

602
00:24:03.941 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 1>since it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more going,</v>

603
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.320
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain people that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a weird feel to them.</v>

604
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.220
<v Speaker 1>You meet him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

605
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I just gotta get away from this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

606
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

607
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.150
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely people that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving off weird feelings and it could</v>

608
00:24:16.151 --> 00:24:21.151
<v Speaker 1>be that your reading their intent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a way that you don't see</v>

609
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:22.330
<v Speaker 1>visually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

610
00:24:22.331 --> 00:24:25.650
<v Speaker 1>you're recognized by their body language</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it could be a bunch of things.</v>

611
00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

612
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Plead and run when you met me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

613
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know we're probably scheduled to</v>

614
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 2>do this interview so you can</v>

615
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.910
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking forward to this.</v>

616
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Why would I run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>

617
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed by your intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I expected that in a way.</v>

618
00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how you could be a race car</v>

619
00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:44.280
<v Speaker 1>driver and not be anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially be a woman and a race car</v>

620
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:45.360
<v Speaker 1>driver and not be in touch.</v>

621
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's nothing I even thought about</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I was like 14.</v>

622
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first few ways,</v>

623
00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:52.300
<v Speaker 2>abrasive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way late in life,</v>

624
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.550
<v Speaker 2>think about being a girl out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't until I had cameras following</v>

625
00:24:56.551 --> 00:24:58.860
<v Speaker 2>me around my schools and stuff that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

626
00:24:58.861 --> 00:24:59.730
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is,</v>

627
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.560
<v Speaker 2>and then they start asking you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

628
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:02.820
<v Speaker 2>what's it like to be a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

629
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:03.571
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And originally,</v>

630
00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really thought about that.</v>

631
00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many other girls do it?</v>

632
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are various girls here and there,</v>

633
00:25:10.111 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

634
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 1>like in all of Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many women are right or racing?</v>

635
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my level,</v>

636
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.700
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

637
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

638
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.040
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

639
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

640
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

641
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it from me.</v>

642
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it like to be a girl in racing?</v>

643
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:26.381
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

644
00:25:26.381 --> 00:25:27.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what it's like to be</v>

645
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:28.630
<v Speaker 2>a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

646
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have my perspective.</v>

647
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.260
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

648
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

649
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:36.100
<v Speaker 2>like being a girl versus a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference?</v>

650
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it like to be a guy?</v>

651
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:39.771
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

652
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it probably be different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that like,</v>

653
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:47.771
<v Speaker 1>what's it like to be a woman that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only woman who's in Nascar at your</v>

654
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:49.694
<v Speaker 1>level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

655
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a valid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

656
00:25:51.231 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does,</v>

657
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>how does everybody else treat you?</v>

658
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

659
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really is the main question.</v>

660
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer because I'm not them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I write,</v>

661
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

662
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from enough experience now,</v>

663
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>because I used to not really look into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it much.</v>

664
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:08.300
<v Speaker 2>And then in the indycar days you</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't hit each other.</v>

665
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

666
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>you could block and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were some guys out there that</v>

668
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 2>were assholes and I didn't like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

669
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 2>sometimes every driver has some dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other drivers that they don't</v>

670
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 2>really get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

671
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 2>but in Nascar you can hit each other and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

672
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you have bumpers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

673
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 2>which is really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also isn't cool because if</v>

674
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>somebody wants to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

675
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 2>So what would I say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that they don't want to get</v>

676
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 2>passed by a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>

677
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that weird?</v>

678
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

679
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:38.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've driven,</v>

680
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I've raced with girls and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

681
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel differently when a</v>

682
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 3>guy passes you then when a girl passes</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably,</v>

683
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

684
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

685
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll just go internally.</v>

686
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 3>That bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

687
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 5>can't believe my car isn't faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

688
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.370
<v Speaker 5>This sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was a guy that passed stories</v>

689
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.390
<v Speaker 5>that are not good that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

690
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.020
<v Speaker 5>come on the radio and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

691
00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:07.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want you to see that what car</v>

692
00:27:07.121 --> 00:27:10.990
<v Speaker 5>passed me and how bad my car is out now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now I'm,</v>

693
00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:13.360
<v Speaker 5>so it happens with guys too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

694
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a cultural norm that girls</v>

695
00:27:17.171 --> 00:27:19.030
<v Speaker 5>aren't good and allow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

696
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.580
<v Speaker 5>aren't very good and that they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

697
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.350
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhat don't belong.</v>

698
00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:26.470
<v Speaker 5>And I get like the little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 5>animosity at first,</v>

699
00:27:26.471 --> 00:27:28.360
<v Speaker 5>but I would have thought that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have got,</v>

700
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.340
<v Speaker 5>got used to it a little bit more than</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

701
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.380
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have that cultural and Masa,</v>

702
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:34.850
<v Speaker 5>you were saying a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

703
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.940
<v Speaker 3>it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you say that it's a,</v>

704
00:27:37.941 --> 00:27:40.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a cultural norm that girls aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

705
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 3>You don't think about that about</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

706
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.290
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

707
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.220
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that.</v>

708
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

709
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.410
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any doubts.</v>

710
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get everyone out there.</v>

711
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:48.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you suck because of this and I'm going</v>

712
00:27:48.881 --> 00:27:51.140
<v Speaker 5>to beat you because of that and right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

713
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:53.840
<v Speaker 5>I hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think because I'm a girl,</v>

714
00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as good as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

715
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:55.671
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

716
00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 5>So why would you think that about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other girl?</v>

717
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just did it cause I'm not used to it.</v>

718
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just something you're not used to.</v>

719
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

720
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we'll also,</v>

721
00:28:03.801 --> 00:28:04.634
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're unique.</v>

722
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you were out there in the gym</v>

723
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 5>and some girl comes and picks up more</v>
<v Speaker 5>weight than you and you're like,</v>

724
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.880
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's weird.</v>

725
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 5>I'll be like that pitches on roids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She probably would be,</v>

726
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 5>but Amazon freak,</v>

727
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.840
<v Speaker 3>some genetic freak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to sign her.</v>

728
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Bring it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

729
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.750
<v Speaker 3>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

730
00:28:19.751 --> 00:28:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Throw a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

731
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

732
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.961
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

733
00:28:22.961 --> 00:28:25.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all have a cultural</v>

734
00:28:25.481 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 3>prejudices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

735
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Speaker 3>To a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether we admit it or not.</v>

736
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.531
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

737
00:28:29.531 --> 00:28:32.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're not a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it maybe you're just maybe just have</v>

738
00:28:32.951 --> 00:28:36.250
<v Speaker 3>reservations and you're pleasantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised when people surpass those</v>

739
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.930
<v Speaker 3>expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

740
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I would think that a,</v>

741
00:28:39.821 --> 00:28:44.821
<v Speaker 3>you would experience probably more</v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination as a woman.</v>

742
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.223
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

743
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think about a woman doing almost</v>

744
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.050
<v Speaker 3>any other job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're telling me you're the</v>

745
00:28:53.051 --> 00:28:58.051
<v Speaker 3>only woman that does that and you're at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this intense macho job,</v>

746
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.810
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking intense job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

747
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.960
<v Speaker 3>you'd going 200 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's,</v>

748
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.260
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy job.</v>

749
00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.430
<v Speaker 3>And you're out there at the top of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>food chain with all these men.</v>

750
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

751
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine there's two things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

752
00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of guys they treat you</v>
<v Speaker 3>with respect there.</v>

753
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.290
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

754
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320
<v Speaker 3>They're like impress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

755
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

756
00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 3>They're cool with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

757
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.280
<v Speaker 3>she's one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

758
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.750
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a few that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>dicks and the those dicks or just</v>

759
00:29:28.751 --> 00:29:32.580
<v Speaker 3>encourageable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm Man.</v>

760
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.950
<v Speaker 5>The amount of times I wish I was good at</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking people out.</v>

761
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.280
<v Speaker 5>I wish people knew how hard it was to</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually take someone out on track.</v>

762
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would cause you can risk taking</v>

763
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

764
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if your car doesn't handle very</v>

765
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't get close enough to him.</v>

766
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 5>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would just move the air,</v>

767
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 5>which is almost like hitting him and get</v>
<v Speaker 5>him out of the way.</v>

768
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 5>But sometimes the car doesn't handle</v>
<v Speaker 5>well enough,</v>

769
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 5>so like you'd have to just bomb in there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and God willing,</v>

770
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 5>you hit them to get you to slow down and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then these go sailing and you keep</v>

771
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's risk.</v>

772
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 5>That's a rare moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

773
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you done it before?</v>

774
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:08.580
<v Speaker 5>I've tried to take people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suck at it,</v>

775
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 5>absolutely suck at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've taken myself out like three times</v>

776
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 5>trying to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

777
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be the lamb.</v>

778
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind it to make a point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

779
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to make a point of someone's</v>

780
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:20.250
<v Speaker 5>driving like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

781
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

782
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.200
<v Speaker 2>So what was the one that was the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad was,</v>

783
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:26.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

784
00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 2>it was a couple of years ago was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martinsville and this is when something</v>

785
00:30:30.331 --> 00:30:34.350
<v Speaker 2>was going down with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano and</v>

786
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:37.590
<v Speaker 2>it was during the chase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the last 10 races of the</v>

787
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.210
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were in the chase,</v>

788
00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Matt and Joey and Joey had made it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Matt couldn't get in,</v>

789
00:30:43.411 --> 00:30:46.170
<v Speaker 2>cause he took them out of week earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>week or two earlier and then they got to</v>

790
00:30:46.171 --> 00:30:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Martinsville and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small short track.</v>

791
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just a half a mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>

792
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.550
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to kind of be able to attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>

793
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 2>And so he just straight took them out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

794
00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole big hoopla about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People up in arms thought it was totally</v>

795
00:31:01.771 --> 00:31:03.630
<v Speaker 2>unfair and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

796
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:06.840
<v Speaker 2>during the same race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some asshole hits me,</v>

797
00:31:06.841 --> 00:31:09.630
<v Speaker 2>takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spins me out and so I come back and I'm</v>

798
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.440
<v Speaker 2>a lap down or something cause he spins</v>
<v Speaker 2>me out and I go to take him out and I</v>

799
00:31:13.441 --> 00:31:14.880
<v Speaker 2>just sail off into the corner.</v>

800
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:19.560
<v Speaker 2>He manages to kind of keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spin again because I'm horrible at it.</v>

801
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that,</v>

802
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:26.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get up $50,000 fine because I am,</v>

803
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not racing for position because I</v>

804
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:30.730
<v Speaker 2>was a lap down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

805
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 2>and they applied that because that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>also the same race that Matt and Joey</v>

806
00:31:34.231 --> 00:31:37.500
<v Speaker 2>had their big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think maybe joey was leading or</v>

807
00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:39.330
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was leading and it was on a</v>

808
00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 2>restart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

809
00:31:40.651 --> 00:31:42.300
<v Speaker 2>so they weren't racing for position</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

810
00:31:42.301 --> 00:31:46.620
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of like their rule that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put forth to make for,</v>

811
00:31:46.621 --> 00:31:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

812
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Matt probably got a hundred or $200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

813
00:31:50.011 --> 00:31:51.570
<v Speaker 2>but I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

814
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the,</v>

815
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely screwed in this scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got fined 50 grand for it and I'm</v>

816
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:58.104
<v Speaker 2>the one that's out</v>

817
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 5>the other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're racing for position,</v>

818
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 5>then it's okay to bump into each other</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently.</v>

819
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:02.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

820
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So really you're the one that screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're racing,</v>

821
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.650
<v Speaker 2>if someone takes you out and then you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>still racing for position,</v>

822
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:12.870
<v Speaker 2>now you're going to have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially,</v>

823
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting yourself in another position to</v>

824
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:18.690
<v Speaker 2>get taken out when they started it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a no win for the person that's</v>

825
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.900
<v Speaker 2>being aggressed the aggressor.</v>

826
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Was it always legal to bump into each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other?</v>

827
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gone kind of through waves of</v>

828
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:29.350
<v Speaker 5>different rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

829
00:32:29.351 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is legal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when,</v>

830
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 5>whenever a big accident happens and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a tragedy,</v>

831
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 5>I would assume that that's when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>tightened down the rules.</v>

832
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 5>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes,</v>

833
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 5>sometimes not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you just accept</v>

834
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just usually if there's</v>

835
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 2>something like that that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not from one person's action that</v>

836
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe a chain of events that leads</v>
<v Speaker 2>to something like that.</v>

837
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the rare jobs that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sport,</v>

838
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:57.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the rare sports where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for death is always there.</v>

839
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

840
00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.913
<v Speaker 2>It is true.</v>

841
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Does that one of the reasons why you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided</v>

842
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a daredevil.</v>

843
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Like I am not a daredevil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went bungee jumping and that is the</v>

844
00:33:07.741 --> 00:33:11.460
<v Speaker 2>bravest thing I've ever done otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I only did it because I am afraid of</v>

845
00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:13.470
<v Speaker 2>heights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just needed to know that if I had</v>

846
00:33:13.471 --> 00:33:14.670
<v Speaker 2>to conquer a fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

847
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your definition of a daredevil?</v>

848
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Your your briefings or you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially get hurt.</v>

849
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

850
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a race car driver,</v>

851
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a methodical driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm methodical.</v>

852
00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't go out there and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 2>hold it wide open until the car does</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then I'm like up better</v>

854
00:33:33.421 --> 00:33:34.320
<v Speaker 2>lift now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

855
00:33:34.321 --> 00:33:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm a thoughtful drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I build up what I think what you're</v>

856
00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:39.540
<v Speaker 2>saying is you're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

857
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.030
<v Speaker 2>that's very nice of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a really,</v>

858
00:33:42.031 --> 00:33:44.580
<v Speaker 2>really nice way to say that.</v>

859
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not dumb,</v>

860
00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but you're definitely a daredevil.</v>

861
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.151
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

862
00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

863
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.720
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can not be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not,</v>

864
00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really knows me,</v>

865
00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:56.930
<v Speaker 2>knows that I'm not brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

866
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.410
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

867
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I think you're talking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy talk over here.</v>

868
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just have been grooming this talent</v>

870
00:34:06.451 --> 00:34:09.660
<v Speaker 2>since I was 10 and 26 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

871
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with it.</v>

872
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's no doubt that you're</v>

873
00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:15.810
<v Speaker 1>a brave person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

874
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Actually my first time in a go kart was</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

875
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.573
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you three,</v>

876
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:22.820
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and my sister was eight.</v>

877
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.760
<v Speaker 2>My Dad built the go carts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big parking lot out back.</v>

878
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.810
<v Speaker 2>So we got like spray cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wd Fort,</v>

879
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop cans,</v>

880
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

881
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the Midwest,</v>

882
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 2>so pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

883
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 2>and set them up in a big circle for my</v>
<v Speaker 2>sister and I to go out and drive around,</v>

884
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.170
<v Speaker 2>drive our go carts for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

885
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:44.270
<v Speaker 2>my dad made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a little mistake with the</v>

886
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:47.190
<v Speaker 2>brake pedal and so it stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

887
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.930
<v Speaker 2>since I'm 10 and I'm s really young and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb and I don't know what I'm doing,</v>

888
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb and broke,</v>

889
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:53.324
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

890
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 2>like the song goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

891
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

892
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I went to hit the break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't there,</v>

893
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>so instead of just spinning out or</v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing to turn,</v>

894
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I just went straight and I was headed</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

895
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trailer,</v>

896
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.450
<v Speaker 2>like kind of a higher elevated trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would have resulted in</v>

897
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:09.300
<v Speaker 2>decapitation.</v>

898
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 2>And I swerved at the last second and hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concrete wall and I like go flying and</v>

899
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 2>my arm lays back on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the muffler and my cool puffy jacket</v>

900
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>burns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I bruises all up my legs and on</v>

901
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

902
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was my first time in a go kart</v>

903
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:25.491
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>five or 10 minutes of being out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

905
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad just got a new one and built it</v>

906
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:32.150
<v Speaker 2>and we went racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I am really brave.</v>

907
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:32.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

908
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like an indy car to some</v>

909
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't brave because people were</v>

910
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 2>willing to do things that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceivably more brave.</v>

911
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did describe them as dumb.</v>

912
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.571
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

913
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:49.380
<v Speaker 2>So you're probably a little right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm maybe a little right too,</v>

914
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:50.020
<v Speaker 2>but you're right.</v>

915
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I think you definitely brave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's definitely a line</v>

916
00:35:52.131 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 3>where bravery becomes stupid because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>risk outweighs the reward 100% yeah.</v>

917
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a masculine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of ways because it's</v>

918
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 3>testosterone makes you do really stupid</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

919
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Does it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all competing against each other</v>

920
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 3>and the trying to out macho each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

921
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.600
<v Speaker 3>you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

922
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of twitter accounts so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go and see what's that one,</v>

923
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 3>hold this beer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

924
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Has a twitter account called hold my</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer while all these,</v>

925
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly why I do everything.</v>

926
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like jumping off roofs and stupid</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

927
00:36:22.741 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost all men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's occasionally a drunk girl doing</v>

928
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 3>something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost entirely men.</v>

929
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 3>So I would think that men trying to out</v>
<v Speaker 3>macho with each other</v>

930
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.140
<v Speaker 2>somewhat inferior then because they do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of dumb stuff.</v>

931
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe their hormones are not in balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ours.</v>

932
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.400
<v Speaker 3>They definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when competing against each other,</v>

933
00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.810
<v Speaker 3>we'll do dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interest around drones to</v>

934

938
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.360

00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:00.790
<v Speaker 3>not scared as part of being a man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And they're like nothing.</v>

956
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it really nothing?</v>

957
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just want me to like</v>

958
00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:37.820
<v Speaker 3>decompress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

959
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it just wound it.</v>

960
00:37:39.081 --> 00:37:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that annoying when a girl does that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on the girl,</v>

961
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.810
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

962
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Depends on the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she's annoying,</v>

963
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:47.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's annoying.</v>

964
00:37:47.121 --> 00:37:50.810
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in love with her and she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome and she can ask what's wrong,</v>

965
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.243
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

966
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the time.</v>

967
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.050
<v Speaker 3>The right one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

968
00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:01.060
<v Speaker 3>100% that's 100% yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's asking you questions and</v>

969
00:38:01.191 --> 00:38:04.340
<v Speaker 3>you're getting really fucking annoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not the question.</v>

970
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.150
<v Speaker 3>It's probably more the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think someone's amazing and they</v>

971
00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:09.950
<v Speaker 3>ask you something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll just laugh.</v>

972
00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:12.920
<v Speaker 3>You won't get annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you guys get both joke around about</v>

973
00:38:12.921 --> 00:38:15.070
<v Speaker 3>how stupid it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the question was dumb.</v>

974
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.070
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

975
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.560
<v Speaker 3>You get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's most likely you're just like,</v>

976
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.873
<v Speaker 3>I know it anyway.</v>

977
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just like ready to ready to</v>

978
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:26.270
<v Speaker 2>ready to sort of fall over that annoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get out.</v>

979
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Get out of my space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a attitude.</v>

980
00:38:28.881 --> 00:38:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're already annoyed with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

981
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.790
<v Speaker 2>You're already don't really like him.</v>

982
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably something that's</v>

983
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 3>already rubbing you the wrong way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're tolerating each other instead of</v>

984
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 3>enjoying each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

985
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine a person like you,</v>

986
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 3>a very intense person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably have a difficult time</v>

987
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>finding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

988
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 3>like if you get a square peg in a square</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole and everything slides in together,</v>

989
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everything's amazing personality</v>

990
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 3>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

991
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 3>behavior wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine what something like you</v>

992
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very particular,</v>

993
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:01.450
<v Speaker 3>you have to find someone who appreciates</v>
<v Speaker 3>your intensity,</v>

994
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:03.543
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

996
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.840

<v Speaker 3>sort of like docile little creature.</v>

997
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be home.</v>

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls like to be,</v>

1053
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:10.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls like of course,</v>

1054
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

1055
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.990
<v Speaker 2>be appreciated just like a guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1056
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my advice most of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in relationships.</v>

1057
00:41:16.181 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy goes a really long way because</v>

1058
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I know it goes a long way with me no</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what facet of my life it is.</v>

1059
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.400
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy goes a long way.</v>

1060
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:26.980
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your husband's in a bad mood,</v>

1061
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:28.570
<v Speaker 2>then why don't you just actually start</v>
<v Speaker 2>off with,</v>

1062
00:41:28.571 --> 00:41:30.490
<v Speaker 2>instead of feeling like you're under</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciated going,</v>

1063
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.620
<v Speaker 2>hey baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like you've had a really long day</v>

1064
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you've been working your</v>
<v Speaker 2>butt off.</v>

1065
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what can I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I make you dinner?</v>

1066
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your favorite?</v>

1067
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll probably go,</v>

1068
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what is not that not that big</v>

1069
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.521
<v Speaker 2>of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what Babe,</v>

1070
00:41:41.521 --> 00:41:42.081
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1071
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:44.030
<v Speaker 2>let me take you out to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to eat.</v>

1072
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:46.410
<v Speaker 2>The sympathy gets sympathy back and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1073
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good to do it to get it</v>

1074
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:51.650
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should really feel like you are</v>

1075
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:54.320
<v Speaker 2>sympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they're in a bad place,</v>

1076
00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 2>try and help him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sound advice.</v>

1077
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>center stage.</v>

1078
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Just sympathy because most people go</v>
<v Speaker 2>under appreciate,</v>

1079
00:42:00.471 --> 00:42:02.600
<v Speaker 2>especially in a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the longer it goes,</v>

1080
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of under appreciation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions that get made about who does</v>

1081
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 2>what and checks that box off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And probably,</v>

1082
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:11.910
<v Speaker 2>especially with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right amounts,</v>

1083
00:42:11.911 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Speaker 2>you're with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets way worse.</v>

1084
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of time that's involved</v>

1085
00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.090
<v Speaker 3>with taking care of those little</v>
<v Speaker 3>suckers.</v>

1086
00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:21.180
<v Speaker 3>You got to pay attention to them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to them and they,</v>

1087
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.270
<v Speaker 3>and if you have more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like once you start talking to one,</v>

1088
00:42:24.271 --> 00:42:26.970
<v Speaker 3>the other one wants to just chime in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:42:26.971 --> 00:42:28.350
<v Speaker 3>and show you what they're doing.</v>

1090
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.931
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1091
00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:30.970
<v Speaker 2>I was busy just trying to make sure you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't die.</v>

1092
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Now I gotta deal with this.</v>

1093
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 3>I think people get used to things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1095
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the problem.</v>

1096
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 3>They get used to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.150
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1098
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1099
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people,</v>

1100
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 3>aspire to be the person you pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be when you're trying to get laid.</v>

1101
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.350
<v Speaker 3>If you could be that person all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1102
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 3>you will have a much better life.</v>

1103
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I also love the expression for every hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>chick,</v>

1104
00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a dude sickest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Groner.</v>

1105
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't say it that way,</v>

1106
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use more flavorful language,</v>

1107
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

1108
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that too much or too little?</v>

1109
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Too Little?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you say it?</v>

1110
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for every hot chick,</v>

1111
00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:14.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy somewhere that's tired of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking her.</v>

1112
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you'd say it,</v>

1113
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.970
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I guess but that's not entirely</v>

1114
00:43:20.971 --> 00:43:25.200
<v Speaker 3>true either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's for the most part,</v>

1115
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.620
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the times it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the times people don't</v>

1116
00:43:28.621 --> 00:43:30.570
<v Speaker 3>appreciate for circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1117
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.700
<v Speaker 3>and then it's with various aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>

1118
00:43:32.701 --> 00:43:36.780
<v Speaker 3>like I always feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just got over the flu a week and</v>

1119
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.430
<v Speaker 3>a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the flu and I was sick for like</v>

1120
00:43:38.431 --> 00:43:40.710
<v Speaker 3>two days and then when I was sick I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

1121
00:43:40.711 --> 00:43:44.190
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate how good I feel when</v>

1122
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:49.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm healthy because here I am line here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll aiken watching netflix feeling like</v>

1123
00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:50.790
<v Speaker 3>shit going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1124
00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:52.950
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm healthy and I'm working out and I'm</v>

1125
00:43:52.951 --> 00:43:57.951
<v Speaker 3>running and doing Jujitsu and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>activities and I got all this energy and</v>

1126
00:43:58.621 --> 00:44:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just can't do anything right now.</v>

1127
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I just take it for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do forget the joy of just being</v>

1128
00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:08.700
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just escapes us.</v>

1129
00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 3>We just so think it's normal because</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time you granted,</v>

1130
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1131
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that your stepping away</v>

1132
00:44:18.061 --> 00:44:22.650
<v Speaker 3>from race car driving when you deciding</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like enough is enough?</v>

1133
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that in some ways that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1134
00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:30.480
<v Speaker 3>you appreciating other aspects of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1135
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 3>that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1136
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

1137
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 1>looking at your racing thing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1138
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot,</v>

1139
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I did enough and then why don't I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate all the other stuff?</v>

1140
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good question.</v>

1141
00:44:41.651 --> 00:44:43.570
<v Speaker 2>A leading me into a good thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1142
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:48.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually more me being</v>

1143
00:44:48.221 --> 00:44:52.000
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think everyone would expect since</v>

1144
00:44:52.001 --> 00:44:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I do what I do at the level that I do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1145
00:44:54.161 --> 00:44:56.500
<v Speaker 2>that racing is my only thing I care</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1146
00:44:56.501 --> 00:44:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I love it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do anything I drive every day.</v>

1147
00:44:58.841 --> 00:45:01.750
<v Speaker 2>And the truth is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like racing,</v>

1148
00:45:01.751 --> 00:45:03.130
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things I don't really</v>

1149
00:45:03.131 --> 00:45:06.280
<v Speaker 2>like about it too and I'm grateful for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything it's given me.</v>

1150
00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:10.330
<v Speaker 2>But if you were to ask me what I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of racing and my personal life,</v>

1151
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't go to the race track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really watch races.</v>

1152
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that.</v>

1153
00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:17.380
<v Speaker 2>So those aren't my hobbies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your hobbies or your real loves,</v>

1154
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.140
<v Speaker 1>what do you not like about it?</v>

1155
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I would say that in the last year</v>

1156
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.310
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1157
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.370
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as an energetic space,</v>

1158
00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:32.090
<v Speaker 2>it's just so sad and negative at times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the time.</v>

1159
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And even in just racing in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time it's miserable.</v>

1160
00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you have some days that are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time it's not happy and</v>

1161
00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:40.700
<v Speaker 2>you wish there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1162
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:41.543
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1163
00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.020
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1164
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.410
<v Speaker 2>you're not satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wish somebody would have treated you</v>

1165
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 2>better out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1166
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.390
<v Speaker 2>there's so many things to be negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and just the grind of it.</v>

1167
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the people,</v>

1168
00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:58.130
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's worn out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be really careful about the</v>

1169
00:45:58.131 --> 00:46:00.830
<v Speaker 2>people that are around you because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to be in a good mood because it's</v>

1170
00:46:00.831 --> 00:46:04.490
<v Speaker 2>easy to spiral out of control because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see each other for three,</v>

1171
00:46:04.491 --> 00:46:06.950
<v Speaker 2>four days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week for 40 weeks a year.</v>

1172
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.731
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>you got to be in a good space with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1174
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's still doesn't alienate you</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

1175
00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Even if there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a good space with people,</v>

1176
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the ones next to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you've got a car next to you on</v>

1177
00:46:16.611 --> 00:46:20.510
<v Speaker 2>both sides in the garage and haulers</v>
<v Speaker 2>next to each other and buses right next</v>

1178
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.640
<v Speaker 2>to each other and you see a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1179
00:46:22.641 --> 00:46:23.690
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1180
00:46:23.691 --> 00:46:24.710
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1181
00:46:24.711 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of negativity to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

1182
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of grind.</v>

1183
00:46:28.551 --> 00:46:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It just kinda feels like the grind a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

1184
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1185
00:46:32.361 --> 00:46:36.680
<v Speaker 2>so I just kind of felt like it wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 2>space that I wanted to be in as much</v>

1186
00:46:36.681 --> 00:46:37.311
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1187
00:46:37.311 --> 00:46:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be in a happy space where I'm</v>

1188
00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:43.400
<v Speaker 2>just doing things that bring me joy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1189
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1190
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.690
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't doing that as much or I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing it,</v>

1191
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I was noticing I was missing that or</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting it more.</v>

1192
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really what it comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>is growing as a person and realizing,</v>

1193
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody's afraid to take</v>

1194
00:46:57.471 --> 00:47:00.560
<v Speaker 2>chances and do something new in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life because they're identified a</v>

1195
00:47:00.561 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>certain way or there'll be judged if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't do it or judged if they do</v>

1196
00:47:03.951 --> 00:47:07.130
<v Speaker 2>something different and who are they now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are they crazy and what are they</v>

1197
00:47:07.131 --> 00:47:08.870
<v Speaker 2>thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1198
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.720
<v Speaker 2>it's just life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do things that make you happy.</v>

1199
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and the negative aspects of</v>

1200
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:18.660
<v Speaker 1>it as all interpersonal relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so talking to people,</v>

1201
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about that the grind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of racing itself,</v>

1202
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.460
<v Speaker 1>like the heat of being in the car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strain and the intensity and the</v>

1203
00:47:26.461 --> 00:47:27.900
<v Speaker 1>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about it.</v>

1204
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:28.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1205
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the first thing.</v>

1206
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1207
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 2>that exists on some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's,</v>

1208
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work out,</v>

1209
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I work out twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of time,</v>

1210
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm okay with the whole like physical</v>

1211
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 2>grind of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that is part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The physical part of racing exists and</v>

1226
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 2>it is exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1227
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you recover from that every weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I just love so many other things.</v>

1231
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.650
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1232
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest project I have is my wine.</v>

1233
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought the property in 2009,</v>

1234
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 2>planted a vineyard and it's finally for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sale.</v>

1235
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:28.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1236
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's called,</v>

1237
00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 2>started in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nine years bought the property,</v>

1238
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 2>planted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started from nothing.</v>

1239
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:36.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1240
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>it came from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2006,</v>

1241
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I went to Napa valley on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a trip and was on this beautiful</v>

1242
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 2>property and just like looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fog and the valley and it was wonderful</v>

1243
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Keesha's and fruits for breakfast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing white wine.</v>

1244
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:50.891
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1245
00:48:50.891 --> 00:48:53.660
<v Speaker 2>it'd be so cool if I could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this someday,</v>

1246
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have $50 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least not right now anyway.</v>

1247
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I never abandoned the thought that</v>

1248
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I would be able to afford that someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't,</v>

1249
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.653
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't then.</v>

1250
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

1251
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I just started the process of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1252
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't buy a wine that was built and</v>
<v Speaker 2>established for the vineyard.</v>

1253
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I bought dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted the vineyard.</v>

1254
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.190
<v Speaker 2>How do you go about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hire someone?</v>

1255
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.001
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I,</v>

1256
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:21.001
<v Speaker 2>that that day I met I winemaker who</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up going into consulting instead</v>

1257
00:49:21.131 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 2>of just being at one winery and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he actually helped me pick the</v>

1258
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still my winemaker today.</v>

1259
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you buy this piece of land and then like</v>

1260
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 2>who does the day to day stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so busy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>translations trying to come up with,</v>

1281
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1282
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just decided it was going to come out</v>

1283
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 2>in the spraying along with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the cab or early release and the</v>

1284
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1285
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and the rosy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it needed some time in barrel.</v>

1286
00:50:36.511 --> 00:50:39.170
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to wait a little longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it in barrel.</v>

1287
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that much take a shit load of your</v>

1288
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.950
<v Speaker 1>time and thinking as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

1289
00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the least amount of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>time really that company.</v>

1290
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine if you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant investment,</v>

1291
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant investment,</v>

1292
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1293
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you have someone working for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're growing grapes,</v>

1294
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 2>two employees and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1295
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers that farm,</v>

1296
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:02.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they farm many other properties,</v>

1297
00:51:02.191 --> 00:51:03.570
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

1298
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Were you affected at all by the crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fires and no,</v>

1299
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.180
<v Speaker 2>actually I was really lucky that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Napa valley fires were,</v>

1300
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on Silverado trail side up.</v>

1301
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.750
<v Speaker 2>It's actually very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very close to how mountain appalachian,</v>

1302
00:51:15.751 --> 00:51:16.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1303
00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.720
<v Speaker 2>like 60 feet off of being home out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Appalachian.</v>

1304
00:51:19.721 --> 00:51:22.640
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way down south on Silverado trail there</v>

1305
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:25.470
<v Speaker 2>was fire and then straight across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>

1306
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Not too far laterally across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was all the way across the valley</v>

1307
00:51:29.641 --> 00:51:33.360
<v Speaker 2>was the fires on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was about as far away from it all</v>

1308
00:51:33.361 --> 00:51:35.760
<v Speaker 2>is I could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just talked to my wine maker,</v>

1309
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a few days ago and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that there's really nothing,</v>

1310
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.660
<v Speaker 2>no residual from any of the fires or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1311
00:51:42.661 --> 00:51:44.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with my wine.</v>

1312
00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:45.204
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1313
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.270
<v Speaker 1>so that whole area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a bummer that fire was in the</v>

1314
00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.710
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

1315
00:51:49.711 --> 00:51:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the exact number,</v>

1316
00:51:51.991 --> 00:51:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but it was something in insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was going a football field</v>

1317
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.830
<v Speaker 1>distance in three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at its peak.</v>

1318
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I know that the bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the big reason was the wind came</v>

1319
00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:04.590
<v Speaker 2>in that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 40 plus mile an hour winds came</v>

1320
00:52:04.591 --> 00:52:06.540
<v Speaker 2>through that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1321
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.280
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very devastating for some.</v>

1322
00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one company.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like skulls and swords and shit?</v>

1328
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.623

1350
00:53:01.501 --> 00:53:03.780
<v Speaker 2>mostly online it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not very much made,</v>

1351
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:04.320
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1352

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1354
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you,</v>

1355
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you get this piece of property and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking to this guy.</v>

1356
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>He was a consultant and you started</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about making wine,</v>

1357
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:16.970
<v Speaker 1>like what is the process like how does</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1358
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.863
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

1359
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you buy the property and then how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the seeds?</v>

1360
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 1>How do you get the right grapes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

1361
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through a bunch of 'em</v>

1362
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 2>permitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1363
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:28.860
<v Speaker 2>so permitting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1364
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 2>plans for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1365
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain grades that are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's over 20 degrees grade,</v>

1366
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 2>then you have to have special approvals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under you can plant.</v>

1367
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:42.600
<v Speaker 2>So I literally planted six acres ish of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max.</v>

1368
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:47.601
<v Speaker 2>It's the Max that I could plant on my 24</v>
<v Speaker 2>acres that I have that was below 20</v>

1369
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 2>degree grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1370
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1371
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go through erosion control</v>

1372
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 2>permitting because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1373
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 2>the slopes and if you're going to dig up</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

1374
00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it to slide down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain if it rains.</v>

1375
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>So we had to kind of get creative with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the,</v>

1376
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure to dissipate the water.</v>

1377
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 2>And so it didn't create just rivers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rushing of,</v>

1378
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new dirt sliding down the hill.</v>

1379
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:11.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1380
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 2>cause it's al Asad elevation a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1381
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1382
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you hire farmers and then the</v>

1383
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:23.121
<v Speaker 2>winemaker helps pick out the root stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the clones and then they plan it and</v>

1384
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:26.520
<v Speaker 2>you wait a couple of years for it to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready and then they start making wine.</v>

1385
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So it starts with clones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is route stops first.</v>

1386
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>root stock.</v>

1387
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.990
<v Speaker 3>And then what does he graft on the clone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they want?</v>

1388
00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:35.620
<v Speaker 3>What's a root stock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the actual route.</v>

1389
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

1390
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew every single thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking to the nth degree,</v>

1391
00:54:41.151 --> 00:54:46.151
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that would be like Cabernet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>petite verdot white wine,</v>

1392
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:47.850
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1393
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they did all this,</v>

1394
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1395
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fascinating.</v>

1396
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Tiny little tiny little roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1397
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Trellising up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1398
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get into,</v>

1399
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your wine maker,</v>

1400
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:05.300
<v Speaker 2>they decide then how much fruit to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1401
00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.220
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1402
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.990
<v Speaker 2>sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vine comes up and splits off and</v>

1403
00:55:08.991 --> 00:55:10.670
<v Speaker 2>makes like a tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1404
00:55:10.671 --> 00:55:15.671
<v Speaker 2>and so they decide how many clusters</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep on each side to determine,</v>

1405
00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of wine you're making.</v>

1406
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:19.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.790
<v Speaker 2>we drop a lot of fruit to make really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1408
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.130
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean by drop fruit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd lose literally cut the cut</v>

1410
00:55:25.131 --> 00:55:26.240
<v Speaker 3>the cluster off of the vine.</v>

1411
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.013
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1412
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like if you're buying bulk</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine,</v>

1413
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:34.230
<v Speaker 2>it's they're not dropping a damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1414
00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're buying grapes,</v>

1415
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 2>they're also not dropping a damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1416
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as much probably because there,</v>

1417
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:41.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're there,</v>

1418
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're paying by the ton.</v>

1419
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.430
<v Speaker 3>So this is a long process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1420
00:55:45.431 --> 00:55:50.431
<v Speaker 3>it's a really long process to go nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>years from the time you start to making</v>

1421
00:55:50.561 --> 00:55:51.394
<v Speaker 3>your first bottles.</v>

1422
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Probably why most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1423
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have enough money to build a</v>

1424
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 2>winery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably a bit older and like you</v>

1425
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:58.224
<v Speaker 2>run out of time.</v>

1426
00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

1429
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a lot of millions in the hole,</v>

1430
00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:05.620

<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it because you</v>

<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1513
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.190
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with being word</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it's in that era.</v>

1552
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Homes on the top of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a,</v>

1553
01:00:02.101 --> 01:00:04.680
<v Speaker 2>this is a cool place to go if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever visiting Arizona.</v>

1554
01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Jerome is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of wind up this mountain,</v>

1555
01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you get up to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like supposedly all haunted and</v>

1556
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>it's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1557
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.620
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1558
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.300
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the last I knew it was a very</v>

1559
01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:16.860
<v Speaker 2>long time ago that I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1560
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:17.790
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1561
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:18.930
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1562
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:21.900
<v Speaker 2>he has a cool cellar door and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some restaurants and whatnot and it's on</v>

1563
01:00:21.901 --> 01:00:22.734
<v Speaker 2>top of a mountain.</v>

1564
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1565
01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.020
<v Speaker 3>that's maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of thing he's into.</v>

1566
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:32.260
<v Speaker 3>And he's very wise to about balancing</v>
<v Speaker 3>out the rock star life versus like,</v>

1567
01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>was attractive to him about creating a</v>

1568
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:37.874
<v Speaker 3>wine.</v>

1569
01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>

1570
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I think I've feel like I've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life how much grounding I need to</v>

1571
01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:47.760
<v Speaker 2>balance me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like,</v>

1572
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>it's not just like everybody needs 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

1573
01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:52.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been 50% of the time walking around</v>

1574
01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:54.570
<v Speaker 2>in the woods and 50% of the time doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit.</v>

1575
01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:55.800
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:00:55.801 --> 01:00:57.750
<v Speaker 2>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's like,</v>

1577
01:00:57.751 --> 01:01:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 20% of the time I need to take a</v>

1578
01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:06.921
<v Speaker 2>walk in nature or do a yoga class or</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditate or something like that.</v>

1579
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like,</v>

1580
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:12.690
<v Speaker 3>do you need decompression time just from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole celebrity thing,</v>

1581
01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:17.691
<v Speaker 3>just being interviewed and media and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people paying attention to you want to</v>

1582
01:01:17.851 --> 01:01:19.080
<v Speaker 3>take pictures with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just,</v>

1583
01:01:19.081 --> 01:01:21.150
<v Speaker 3>the constant assault.</v>

1584
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel it's exhausting because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening and I'm paying attention.</v>

1585
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm answering your questions honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where I think most people can just go</v>

1586
01:01:30.801 --> 01:01:35.330
<v Speaker 2>into sort of like autopilot mode and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not as mentally exhausting</v>

1587
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:36.510
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1588
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1589
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:40.430
<v Speaker 2>it's just being on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1590
01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just have to be on all the</v>

1591
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1592
01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1593
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>the being on part is nice to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1594
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1595
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of answering the questions,</v>

1596
01:01:51.071 --> 01:01:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just a matter of having</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

1597
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>navigating life and people staring at</v>

1598
01:01:56.261 --> 01:01:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you or wanting something from you or</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking they want something from you</v>

1599
01:01:59.741 --> 01:02:02.440
<v Speaker 2>just because you're trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because too many people have wanted</v>

1600
01:02:02.441 --> 01:02:03.570
<v Speaker 2>something from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1631
01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you move to England to race?</v>

1632
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.300
<v Speaker 2>You were racing in England?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1633
01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I left high school and I was 16 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to England and then I,</v>

1634
01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I lived there for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you parents handle that?</v>

1635
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I think my mom cried a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine but they couldn't.</v>

1636
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:19.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
01:03:19.851 --> 01:03:23.900
<v Speaker 2>they also couldn't imagine me not having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity so they let me go and I</v>

1638
01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>left high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kind of racing.</v>

1639
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Were you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lowest level open wheel racing.</v>

1640
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:30.980
<v Speaker 2>So what's that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open wheel just means that the wheels</v>

1641
01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:32.350
<v Speaker 2>are exposed really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1642
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Versus stock cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are Nascar.</v>

1643
01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm so open wheel wheel is open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1644
01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:40.160
<v Speaker 2>so there was no wings on the cars that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was driving over there at that point in</v>

1645
01:03:40.161 --> 01:03:40.370
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1646
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.360
<v Speaker 2>So it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.940
<v Speaker 2>no wing open wheel cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just,</v>

1648
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting my,</v>

1649
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.320
<v Speaker 2>starting my career really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause from go-carts I will,</v>

1650
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be a professional go</v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers.</v>

1651
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1652
01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get into cars as soon as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1653
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:58.130
<v Speaker 2>How'd this come up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was 14 and I was at the</v>

1654
01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Indianapolis Motor speedway and I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a suite and there was some British</v>

1655
01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:05.450
<v Speaker 2>dude in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started asking about cars and</v>

1656
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.130
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at the race track.</v>

1657
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:08.211
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

1658
01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 2>this family that he works for has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>

1659
01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.490
<v Speaker 2>has a race team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess I asked all the right</v>

1660
01:04:13.491 --> 01:04:14.420
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1661
01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years later,</v>

1662
01:04:17.031 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 2>when I was 16,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they asked me and my dad to come back to</v>

1663
01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:22.670
<v Speaker 2>indy and meet with them and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>going over to England a race.</v>

1664
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.580
<v Speaker 2>And they said I could learn more in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>year in England,</v>

1665
01:04:25.581 --> 01:04:28.640
<v Speaker 2>then five years in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was not true at all,</v>

1666
01:04:28.641 --> 01:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>but I did it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1667
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>English people please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy pompous.</v>

1668
01:04:32.871 --> 01:04:34.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

1669
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1670
01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I might make England people from England</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad,</v>

1671
01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.790
<v Speaker 2>but there's not many that I've liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1672
01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love English people the opposite.</v>

1673
01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I maybe it was just my environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1675
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:50.090
<v Speaker 2>that no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one kept in touch after I left and</v>

1676
01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:53.120
<v Speaker 2>lived there for three years and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept in touch with me at all.</v>

1677
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you were too intense for English</v>

1678
01:04:54.771 --> 01:04:55.730
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1679
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Well they also have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this is where you are and this is</v>

1680
01:04:58.701 --> 01:05:01.690
<v Speaker 3>where you stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have like a very like rigid class</v>

1681
01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.910
<v Speaker 3>butchers there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1682
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:04.280
<v Speaker 3>well amy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1683
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that moved to California</v>

1684
01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:10.790
<v Speaker 3>from England and they are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people over here are so much more</v>

1685
01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:11.624
<v Speaker 3>optimistic about it.</v>

1686
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.950
<v Speaker 2>An open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1687
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:13.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1688
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:15.590
<v Speaker 2>just like bring you in and prove me</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1689
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Instead of like prove to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be your friend.</v>

1690
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a European mentality.</v>

1691
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>A little bit more guarded.</v>

1692
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also being a 16 year old girl,</v>

1693
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.750
<v Speaker 3>living there by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing anybody that had to be</v>

1694
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.570
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew a lot.</v>

1695
01:05:30.571 --> 01:05:34.230
<v Speaker 2>So I learned more there in one year than</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years in America.</v>

1696
01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.180
<v Speaker 2>From a personal standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1697
01:05:36.181 --> 01:05:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I went over there and I was very open</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1698
01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:43.080
<v Speaker 2>unguarded and would tell anyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1699
01:05:43.081 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd that work out for it?</v>

1700
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.340
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got hurt a lot.</v>

1701
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I hated men after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1702
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.110
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1703
01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.870
<v Speaker 3>English accents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now like when you get from men,</v>

1704
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.793
<v Speaker 3>I can obey.</v>

1705
01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Talk a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do a little bit.</v>

1706
01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little scarred.</v>

1707
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:01.201
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1708
01:06:01.201 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

1709
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I came home and my parents describe me</v>
<v Speaker 2>as very cold when I came home.</v>

1710
01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Very guarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cold.</v>

1711
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys visit back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>between them?</v>

1712
01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I would come home like twice a year and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would come over once or twice a</v>

1713
01:06:12.861 --> 01:06:13.491
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1714
01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.620
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't alienation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:16.483
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1716
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:17.990
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they said you were cold when he got</v>

1717
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:18.824
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.210
<v Speaker 3>You became hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1719
01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1721
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1722
01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:26.610
<v Speaker 2>One of the hardest things in life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out who you really are.</v>

1723
01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what you really enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are as a person,</v>

1724
01:06:30.181 --> 01:06:34.020
<v Speaker 2>what you stand for instead of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is told you.</v>

1725
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 3>What advice do you give someone that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do that?</v>

1726
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a great kid,</v>

1727
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't know what the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to do.</v>

1728
01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.950
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to figure it out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1729
01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first quick couple of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do to identify what it is</v>

1730
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:51.031
<v Speaker 2>that you're interested in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's true to you as um,</v>

1731
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what do you do for your hobbies?</v>

1732
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.700
<v Speaker 2>That's very insightful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you enjoy doing?</v>

1733
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 2>If you were by yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a job for you.</v>

1734
01:06:59.021 --> 01:07:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it legal here in California now to</v>

1735
01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.270
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1736
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like some guru farmer.</v>

1737
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1738
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also this is like an odd one,</v>

1739
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but look at the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the pictures on your phone or</v>

1740
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.990
<v Speaker 2>look at the pictures that you post on</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media maybe or something like</v>

1741
01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But whatever you take pictures is also</v>

1742
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:21.130
<v Speaker 2>kind of pretty insightful for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in.</v>

1743
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1744
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:25.330
<v Speaker 2>You're not taking pictures of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't care about.</v>

1745
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:25.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

1746
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>It's your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're all selfies or pictures?</v>

1747
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I think your ego is very loud.</v>

1748
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any selfies on your phone?</v>

1749
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason why I selfies for me</v>

1750
01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:46.230
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are Ah,</v>

1751
01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you're so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But selfie stick.</v>

1752
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1753
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:51.851
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1754
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1755
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>the only way I do them as if I am kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of promoting,</v>

1756
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's a matter of promoting a</v>

1757
01:07:58.031 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 2>healthy lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's me in the gym working out.</v>

1758
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's something like that where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be like post a pit,</v>

1759
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:08.440
<v Speaker 2>like whatever workout I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps what you could look like if</v>

1760
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:12.760
<v Speaker 2>you did these workouts sort of sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe better really.</v>

1761
01:08:12.761 --> 01:08:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1762
01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are why I would take a selfie or</v>

1763
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 2>if it's with someone you really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1764
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:21.740
<v Speaker 2>you can take a picture with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that I don't think that</v>

1765
01:08:21.741 --> 01:08:24.260
<v Speaker 2>does that count as a selfie if it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be doing someone else.</v>

1766
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1767
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 2>That's just being creative with how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a picture of you.</v>

1768
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1769
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:29.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfies,</v>

1770
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:33.710
<v Speaker 2>the only time I do it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty much just to promote either</v>

1771
01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>like clothes I'm wearing for my clothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>line or like workout style stuff for my</v>

1772
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

1773
01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1774
01:08:40.221 --> 01:08:42.410
<v Speaker 2>my hair looks good today and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1775
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:43.281
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1776
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>look at me and I say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1777
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just,</v>

1778
01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not ego driven.</v>

1779
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I know as a woman who is very ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and successful and powerful,</v>

1780
01:08:56.150 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of these social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars now that,</v>

1781
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that just do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stick their butt out and take</v>

1782
01:09:03.291 --> 01:09:06.770
<v Speaker 1>pictures and a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that.</v>

1783
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird</v>

1784
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1785
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And always will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1787
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.553
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1788
01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably deal with it more emotionally</v>

1789
01:09:16.961 --> 01:09:19.810
<v Speaker 2>yourself because it's a vicious circle</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want more,</v>

1790
01:09:19.811 --> 01:09:21.580
<v Speaker 2>so you have to keep doing more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1791
01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you end up dead,</v>

1792
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.230
<v Speaker 2>you end up in a place where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know yourself anymore cause you're doing</v>

1793
01:09:26.231 --> 01:09:29.170
<v Speaker 2>it to fulfill someone else's wants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>desires more than yours.</v>

1794
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right after going to the next level,</v>

1795
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:33.990
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep your like,</v>

1796
01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.920
<v Speaker 2>oh I wore this like super cute like</v>
<v Speaker 2>leggings and a sports bra.</v>

1797
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Now I got to wear a body suit and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing a thong and only crap.</v>

1798
01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look at me now I'm,</v>

1799
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1800
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1801
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:50.600
<v Speaker 1>who are you and after it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of it's oddly successful.</v>

1802
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.200
<v Speaker 1>It's gone to some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their pages of like 17 million</v>

1803
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:54.580
<v Speaker 1>followers.</v>

1804
01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Well whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1805
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1806
01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what it did of course.</v>

1807
01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Then it begs the question like what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>your definition of success then?</v>

1808
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you don't make money off 17</v>

1809
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 2>million followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what's the point?</v>

1810
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I think they do though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do like sponsored posts and stuff</v>

1811
01:10:10.031 --> 01:10:10.864
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1812
01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1813
01:10:12.071 --> 01:10:13.570
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to the next level all the</v>

1814
01:10:13.571 --> 01:10:18.571
<v Speaker 2>time to get more people kind of feeds</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ego's getting fed.</v>

1815
01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>But as a woman who's an attractive woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also very ambitious,</v>

1816
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>like you could have just been one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

1817
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you like</v>

1818
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>when you see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1819
01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:33.540
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think men look at it this way</v>

1820
01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that like look at guys who just do</v>

1821
01:10:38.341 --> 01:10:41.790
<v Speaker 1>like workout instagrams or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and they get look at this</v>

1822
01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:44.370
<v Speaker 1>before from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about use your brains protein</v>

1823
01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a woman who you mean you're not</v>

1824
01:10:48.751 --> 01:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>falling back on your looks is what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to say.</v>

1825
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have them but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just a part of you.</v>

1826
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You're obviously hyper ambitious on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1827
01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like they're like wasting</v>

1828
01:10:59.851 --> 01:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>time or do you feel like that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

1829
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's immaturity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1830
01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's your driving forces,</v>

1831
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:10.470
<v Speaker 2>just your looks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are some that have some</v>

1832
01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1833
01:11:11.671 --> 01:11:14.370
<v Speaker 2>and they can use it to drive a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1834
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some that I've noticed</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1835
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 2>that really do have really positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages.</v>

1836
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm spreading positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading good things,</v>

1837
01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1838
01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>promoting good things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1839
01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those who aren't,</v>

1840
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 2>then I just think it's a level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>immaturity.</v>

1841
01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to come to,</v>

1842
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it will come to bite them</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually because it's,</v>

1843
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.790
<v Speaker 2>where does the road lead to</v>

1844
01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a short lived success.</v>

1845
01:11:37.601 --> 01:11:38.434
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said this once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really great quote that beauty is</v>

1847
01:11:42.641 --> 01:11:45.980
<v Speaker 1>a short lived tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1848
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1849
01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of leads me to a little bit of a s</v>

1850
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.180
<v Speaker 2>one similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1851
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1852
01:11:56.281 --> 01:11:57.170
<v Speaker 2>But it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1853
01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 2>the ego is impatient because it knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's time is limited where the soul is</v>

1854
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:02.121
<v Speaker 2>patient because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1855
01:12:02.121 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 2>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it knows it has forever.</v>

1856
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1857
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should like have memes on like a</v>

1858
01:12:06.691 --> 01:12:07.524
<v Speaker 1>stripper's instagram.</v>

1859
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1860
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.730
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of intrusion when the ego needs to</v>

1861
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 2>be fed immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1862
01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:16.740
<v Speaker 2>the ego wants something now and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the long term or it's</v>

1863
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:18.540
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sole decisions are,</v>

1864
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps on realized for a store for an</v>

1865
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1866
01:12:22.321 --> 01:12:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the truth will always come through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're not living it,</v>

1867
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a transition.</v>

1868
01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Now when you make like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put like an instagram post up of</v>

1869
01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:35.060
<v Speaker 1>workouts and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do that specifically because</v>

1870
01:12:35.061 --> 01:12:36.480
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to motivate people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1871
01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it does for me.</v>

1872
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see somebody hot working out and</v>

1873
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>see a picture of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1874
01:12:41.541 --> 01:12:41.961
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it there,</v>

1875
01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:43.400
<v Speaker 2>get to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1876
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.140
<v Speaker 2>There you get working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh maybe put that,</v>

1877
01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 2>put that chocolate down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1878
01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1879
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1880
01:12:49.061 --> 01:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>especially people in my line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians love to mock things along</v>

1881
01:12:52.811 --> 01:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I take inspiration off of a lot of</v>

1882
01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:56.854
<v Speaker 1>people online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1883
01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.211
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1884
01:12:58.211 --> 01:13:01.420
<v Speaker 2>my overwhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like overall what I hope for people too</v>

1885
01:13:01.421 --> 01:13:02.530
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1886
01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.280
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1887
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.600
<v Speaker 2>with the book I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1888
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really want people to find confidence</v>

1889
01:13:09.191 --> 01:13:12.940
<v Speaker 2>in themselves and develop a healthier</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with food and exercise.</v>

1890
01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:15.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think most people think of food as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a punishment,</v>

1891
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:15.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1892
01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.980
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just eat this terrible vegetable.</v>

1893
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Or they'll like have to work out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>socks were working out,</v>

1894
01:13:21.491 --> 01:13:23.500
<v Speaker 2>can be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Working out can make you feel good.</v>

1895
01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Food can also make you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food is medicine.</v>

1896
01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Food will make you not only feel good</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be good and I'm look better.</v>

1897
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1898
01:13:32.801 --> 01:13:34.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that in all of my</v>

1899
01:13:34.901 --> 01:13:37.870
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it drives people into a direction where</v>

1900
01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:41.170
<v Speaker 2>they feel good about it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

1901
01:13:41.171 --> 01:13:43.180
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more positivity around it.</v>

1902
01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel like there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>negativity around eating healthy and</v>

1903
01:13:46.811 --> 01:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>working out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people that just hate</v>

1904
01:13:48.851 --> 01:13:49.430
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1905
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a lot of positivity</v>

1906
01:13:51.831 --> 01:13:56.390
<v Speaker 1>around it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people are recognizing more</v>

1907
01:13:56.391 --> 01:14:01.391
<v Speaker 1>and more today the benefits of eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy in terms of like psychological</v>

1908
01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.130
<v Speaker 1>benefits like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind works better,</v>

1909
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 1>physical benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about your choices.</v>

1910
01:14:07.131 --> 01:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>You feel better about your momentum in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1911
01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1912
01:14:09.531 --> 01:14:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the right path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1913
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking supplements,</v>

1914
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My body feels I've got more energy.</v>

1915
01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.873
<v Speaker 1>It's tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1916
01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I cut out dairy and</v>

1917
01:14:20.821 --> 01:14:25.821
<v Speaker 2>gluten years ago and my energy level</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally was up and consistent where</v>

1918
01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.980
<v Speaker 2>before it'd be like the random day where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1919
01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I so exhausted today?</v>

1920
01:14:30.751 --> 01:14:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm just so tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.230
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have any of those days</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1922
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1923
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:40.590
<v Speaker 1>When people eat a lot of refined</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and then shift to a diet</v>

1924
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>that has none of that stuff in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stunning.</v>

1925
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1926
01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the effect that it has on your mid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people like if do you need</v>

1927
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 1>a nap in the middle of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those people,</v>

1928
01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:52.750
<v Speaker 1>just try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out your sugar,</v>

1929
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.350
<v Speaker 1>cut out your refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then watch what happens.</v>

1930
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

1931
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.630
<v Speaker 1>You will have so much more energy during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1932
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.370
<v Speaker 2>not a Napper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1933
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1934
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe I like coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are you one of those four hours of</v>

1935

<v Speaker 2>sleep at night people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1936
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:06.370

<v Speaker 2>I'm really annoyingly up and ready to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and happy in the morning.</v>

1949
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I love the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you at night though?</v>

1950
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Sleepy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

1952
01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:41.770
<v Speaker 2>But once I get horizontal at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

1953
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm falling asleep.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1963
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 2>but once I lay down at night and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>tired</v>

1964
01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.780

<v Speaker 2>dairy.</v>

1967
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And then a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1968
01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.503
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:07.460
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1970
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I did an IVF treatment to freeze my eggs</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm getting older and I drive</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:27.440
<v Speaker 2>So you have a ton of shots for like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

1979
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.940
<v Speaker 2>a ton of shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of shots.</v>

1980
01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Every day you stick them in your stomach</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a ton of shots.</v>

1981
01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And so they dropped your estrogen down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nothing.</v>

1982
01:16:35.241 --> 01:16:39.740
<v Speaker 2>And then they ramp it up and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiplies the follicles.</v>

1983
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:44.450
<v Speaker 2>The follicles are what grows the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go in after a while and you start</v>

1984
01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:47.720
<v Speaker 2>getting ultrasounds to see how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>follicles are growing on each side.</v>

1985
01:16:47.721 --> 01:16:49.130
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1986
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:50.900
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was good for me.</v>

1987
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that many grows and they want them</v>

1988
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:58.070
<v Speaker 2>each to get to like one by basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost an inch by an inch,</v>

1989
01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.990
<v Speaker 2>each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I had like,</v>

1990
01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a lot of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1991
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.980
<v Speaker 2>20 to 30 on each side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a shitload of real estate in my</v>

1992
01:17:06.981 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got very 30</v>

1993
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 5>inches on each side of the each one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1995
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 5>did people think you were pregnant?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 5>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look like three,</v>

1997

1998
01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:20.300

<v Speaker 5>eggs in there.</v>

1999
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.860
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible.</v>

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:05.211
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2013
01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:06.080

<v Speaker 2>Like that was what I told her and I was</v>

01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:11.960
<v Speaker 2>asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they go in and every they go in with</v>

2016
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:16.640
<v Speaker 2>a needle and retrieve every one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>one by one with a needle,</v>

2017
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.593
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:23.110
<v Speaker 2>They go in and puncture in through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and retrieve them sucked out</v>

2019
01:18:25.521 --> 01:18:30.521
<v Speaker 2>of their 24 and 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 where mature 19 potential.</v>

2020
01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 2>How do you think you're going to make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about it?</v>

2021
01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2022
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 2>They say you need 20 to guarantee one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pretty much guaranteed one.</v>

2023
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is an insurance policy.</v>

2024
01:18:47.031 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I can try a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>way if I wanted to,</v>

2025
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.123
<v Speaker 2>but anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2026
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back to the back to the point,</v>

2027
01:18:53.631 --> 01:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>like we just got way off track here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is part of the story as to why</v>

2028
01:18:56.811 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I decided to change my diet and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout and why I ended up writing a</v>

2029
01:19:00.921 --> 01:19:01.960
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2030
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 2>was because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gained like four pounds.</v>

2031
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2032
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:06.350
<v Speaker 2>just people I know there's people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2033
01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:06.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

2034
01:19:06.801 --> 01:19:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Four pounds on my frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five foot who I'm small little.</v>

2035
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for any girl out there,</v>

2036
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your genes only fit when you're exactly</v>

2037
01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:17.810
<v Speaker 2>the size that you are and then you gain</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple pounds and they don't anymore.</v>

2038
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I was just uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't,</v>

2039
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I just gained some weight and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything really.</v>

2040
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Well it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2041
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:26.960
<v Speaker 2>it was legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just gained some weight because</v>

2042
01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:29.660
<v Speaker 2>of the hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it instantly also gave me some</v>

2043
01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for people out there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's dudes and testosterone or</v>

2044
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:37.610
<v Speaker 2>women with pregnancy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2045
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:40.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>menopause or whatever it is that changes</v>

2046
01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.710
<v Speaker 2>their hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you just gain weight.</v>

2047
01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2048
01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real.</v>

2049
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:50.090
<v Speaker 2>This isn't just some excuse for getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>older and being lax about your diet or</v>

2050
01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:51.740
<v Speaker 2>your exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really happens.</v>

2051
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:55.490
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I decided to eat Paleo for like a</v>

2052
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2053
01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do it for a week and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

2054
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I never stopped.</v>

2055
01:20:00.321 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So that was two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I also started doing two a day</v>

2056
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>workouts because I wanted to change it</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and sort of kick things up a notch.</v>

2057
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:11.790
<v Speaker 2>But I also realized that I was out</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking my dogs for walks and I was like,</v>

2058
01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm walking them I might as well run</v>

2059
01:20:13.621 --> 01:20:15.060
<v Speaker 2>and do a workout too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2060
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of mile and a half of walking</v>

2061
01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>around the property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go for three.</v>

2062
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you,</v>

2063
01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>you say you do two a days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how do you break it up?</v>

2064
01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're usually a little shorter.</v>

2065
01:20:26.511 --> 01:20:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I would say somewhere between 20 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes each.</v>

2066
01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:31.580
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2067
01:20:31.581 --> 01:20:33.740
<v Speaker 2>one of them will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do upper body,</v>

2068
01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:37.460
<v Speaker 2>lower body and an ab day and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotate through those.</v>

2069
01:20:37.461 --> 01:20:38.294
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2070
01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I keep rotating through those because</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2071
01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.320
<v Speaker 2>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do it right,</v>

2072
01:20:42.321 --> 01:20:45.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do upper body again for a few</v>

2073
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:47.140
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just rotate through those in a nice</v>

2074
01:20:47.141 --> 01:20:48.380
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I have time,</v>

2075
01:20:48.381 --> 01:20:50.480
<v Speaker 2>I do interval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm running,</v>

2076
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:53.510
<v Speaker 2>we're all like sprint for 30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk for 30 seconds,</v>

2077
01:20:53.511 --> 01:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Sprint for 30 s and I'll do that for 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

2078
01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And do you have someone train you or do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do everything yourself?</v>

2079
01:20:58.330 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do everything myself.</v>

2080
01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write,</v>

2081
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I love writing workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the artistic side of me.</v>

2082
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:08.791
<v Speaker 2>I like the balance and the flow of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating something that has fluidity and</v>

2083
01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:11.320
<v Speaker 2>make sense and there's good transitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>through movements.</v>

2084
01:21:11.321 --> 01:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2085
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see your big rogue jim going</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2086
01:21:14.321 --> 01:21:14.951
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2087
01:21:14.951 --> 01:21:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I be happy to program for you if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want me to,</v>

2088
01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to frost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crossfit style workouts.</v>

2089
01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot.</v>

2090
01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do crossfit,</v>

2091
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 3>but most of the stuff I do is kettle</v>

01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:37.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2209
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.970
<v Speaker 2>give yourself time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't freak out for 15,</v>

2210
01:25:38.971 --> 01:25:40.680
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not working.</v>

2211
01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

2212
01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when I'm drinking I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure man,</v>

2213
01:25:45.001 --> 01:25:47.010
<v Speaker 2>this is my third drank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem to be working.</v>

2214
01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And then I hit it harder and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2215
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:52.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brownout or blackout or drugs or do</v>

2216
01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.341
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:25:53.341 --> 01:25:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Actually one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first times I heard one of</v>

2218
01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:56.820
<v Speaker 2>your podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

2219
01:25:56.821 --> 01:25:57.870
<v Speaker 2>it was about dmt.</v>

2220
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the motherlode DMT is the</v>

2221
01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:06.450
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive ingredient that's in Io</v>
<v Speaker 3>Osca and it's the most potent side.</v>

2222
01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:09.360
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a cleaner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaner way to do it as opposed to</v>

2223
01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca where you throw up and shit.</v>

2224
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:12.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2225
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:15.260
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely probably,</v>

2226
01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also quicker,</v>

2227
01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the worst,</v>

2228
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>the longest it's going to take a sec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 or 20 minutes,</v>

2229
01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 3>but there are some places that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it now where they're doing an</v>

2230
01:26:24.561 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 3>intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those trips are apparently,</v>

2231
01:26:27.531 --> 01:26:28.850
<v Speaker 3>that was how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2232
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:31.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a book called DMT,</v>

2233
01:26:31.131 --> 01:26:33.320
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule molecule by this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2234
01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Doctor Rick Strassman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who did all these studies out of the</v>

2235
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:37.580
<v Speaker 3>University of New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2236
01:26:37.581 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were the first,</v>

2237
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA approved clinical studies,</v>

2238
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.200
<v Speaker 3>but it was a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2239
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 3>he did it awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then about that.</v>

2240
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing,</v>

2241
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't intervene intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 3>And they were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for like 40 minutes,</v>

2243
01:26:52.521 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 3>like pull them off into the office to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other dimension.</v>

2244
01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so other dimension,</v>

2245
01:26:58.291 --> 01:26:59.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This dream state,</v>

2246
01:26:59.401 --> 01:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is like a dream state?</v>

2247
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar because they believe</v>

2248
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 3>that your brain during heavy rem sleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>also produces dmt.</v>

2249
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.870
<v Speaker 3>May think that's cause we all have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all had the empty,</v>

2250
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:11.220
<v Speaker 3>everybody has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2251
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has recurring and everyone.</v>

2252
01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's produced by your liver,</v>

2253
01:27:15.411 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 3>your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now they know it's also produced at</v>

2254
01:27:19.311 --> 01:27:23.660
<v Speaker 3>least in rats by your pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is literally your third eye.</v>

2255
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 3>It's actually in certain reptiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually has a retina and the lens</v>

2256
01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2257
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2258
01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 3>It is an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always trying to decalcify my</v>

2259
01:27:33.321 --> 01:27:34.070
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will Glenn,</v>

2260
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:35.820
<v Speaker 3>is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2261
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 3>You get that from them crystal people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sedona?</v>

2262
01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say it's like fluoride.</v>

2263
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Fluoride is calcifying your pineal gland</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2264
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2265
01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.820
<v Speaker 3>watch a cool thing like getting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2266
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.520
<v Speaker 3>How's it getting through my mouth and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2268
01:27:50.521 --> 01:27:52.240
<v Speaker 3>are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure Florence?</v>

2269
01:27:52.241 --> 01:27:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Because nothing you are what you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sordo but are you what you drink?</v>

2270
01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 3>You wine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2271
01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get better with age de.</v>

2272
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've really,</v>

2273
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 3>your pineal gland actually gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>calcified by fluoride in drinking water.</v>

2274
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like some hippie horseshit.</v>

2275
01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It does sound hippie horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see some scientific proof,</v>

2276
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:17.430
<v Speaker 2>but hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the hippy shit,</v>

2277
01:28:17.431 --> 01:28:19.110
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of scientific proof</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2278
01:28:19.290 --> 01:28:19.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2279
01:28:19.801 --> 01:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>there's not a sense of knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it comes down to is a sense</v>

2280
01:28:23.371 --> 01:28:26.850
<v Speaker 2>of knowing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really feel like this is making</v>

2281
01:28:26.851 --> 01:28:28.890
<v Speaker 2>sense to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it register?</v>

2282
01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.350
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I believe this,</v>

2283
01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:32.940
<v Speaker 2>but I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know where it came from.</v>

2284
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

2285
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather trust scientists.</v>

2286
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I like science too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sister and I went and saw Neil</v>

2287
01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:45.310
<v Speaker 2>degrasse Tyson and Indianapolis over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter when it was called the radio</v>

2288
01:28:45.311 --> 01:28:46.210
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was called the,</v>

2289
01:28:46.211 --> 01:28:49.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an astrophysicist reads the newspaper.</v>

2290
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he like pulled Cray,</v>

2291
01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articles and you know,</v>

2292
01:28:53.941 --> 01:28:56.190
<v Speaker 2>just laughed about them basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

2293
01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Pluto came up because he was part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people part of the group that sort of</v>

2294
01:29:00.271 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>said the Pluto wasn't planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2295
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get very upset with him.</v>

2296
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also loved to point out how there'd</v>

2297
01:29:06.511 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 2>be something crazy and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me point out,</v>

2298
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:13.830
<v Speaker 2>this is in the science section of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper.</v>

2299
01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Like as if like how did this make it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science section?</v>

2300
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to come on here sometime in</v>

2301
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:26.310
<v Speaker 3>February and they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to talk to a guy who believes</v>

2302
01:29:26.311 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 3>the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2303
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:29.280
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made fun of that guy too.</v>

2304
01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:32.080
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you are a reflection of what</v>

2305
01:29:32.081 --> 01:29:34.090
<v Speaker 2>it looks like if the earth was flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2306
01:29:34.091 --> 01:29:34.871
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2307
01:29:34.871 --> 01:29:36.310
<v Speaker 2>shadow of a flat line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2308
01:29:36.311 --> 01:29:37.210
<v Speaker 2>of course that's not true.</v>

2309
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Well of course it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of young people out</v>

2310
01:29:40.361 --> 01:29:42.220
<v Speaker 3>there today that believe the earth is</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

2311
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe the earth is flat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2312
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.370
<v Speaker 3>most certainly do not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

2313
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they,</v>

2314
01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:51.380
<v Speaker 2>do they not think we actually go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>outer space and they think that that's</v>

2315
01:29:51.381 --> 01:29:53.600
<v Speaker 2>fake too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's just a matter of,</v>

2316
01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we landed on the moon.</v>

2317
01:29:55.180 --> 01:30:00.180
<v Speaker 1>If there's anything that I think is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more attractive conspiracy</v>

2318
01:30:01.421 --> 01:30:03.910
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the moon landing was because the</v>

2319
01:30:03.911 --> 01:30:08.530
<v Speaker 1>only time they did it was between 1969</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1972 they did seven missions,</v>

2320
01:30:08.531 --> 01:30:12.700
<v Speaker 1>six were successful and that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in human history that people have</v>

2321
01:30:12.701 --> 01:30:17.701
<v Speaker 1>been more than I think 400 miles above</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth's surface.</v>

2322
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the space shuttle missions,</v>

2323
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:27.610
<v Speaker 1>all of the space station missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is inside of 400 miles.</v>

2324
01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.120
<v Speaker 1>The moon is like 260,000 miles there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and they've never even sent a</v>

2325
01:30:33.701 --> 01:30:36.040
<v Speaker 1>chicken in the space and had it come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back alive.</v>

2326
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They never sent anything in this space</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than people like into deep space</v>

2327
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.820
<v Speaker 1>passed the van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allen Radiation Belt packs,</v>

2328
01:30:42.821 --> 01:30:45.700
<v Speaker 1>the MAG needles fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most likely we went,</v>

2329
01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but if there's ever a conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's attractive to me it's that one</v>

2330
01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>cause I just think it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating if during the Nixon</v>

2331
01:30:54.281 --> 01:30:58.040
<v Speaker 1>administration they really did fake it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

2332
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.050
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weirdness to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fake it.</v>

2333
01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all to show military</v>

2334
01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 3>superiority to the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2335
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I used to believe they did fake it.</v>

2336
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was heavily on the side that they</v>

2337
01:31:10.411 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 3>faked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I realized,</v>

2338
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>astrophysics.</v>

2339
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Jack Shit about rocket</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>

2340
01:31:18.631 --> 01:31:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>

2341
01:31:20.131 --> 01:31:25.131
<v Speaker 3>So like me saying that they didn't go</v>
<v Speaker 3>was literally an ignorant perspective.</v>

2342
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Like well it's just being attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theories,</v>

2343
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 3>which is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is that conspiracy</v>

2344
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:36.070
<v Speaker 3>theories are really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like big foot.</v>

2345
01:31:36.130 --> 01:31:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have photos are really fun.</v>

2346
01:31:38.011 --> 01:31:38.844
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff</v>

2347
01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 2>of stuff to get to the get to the core</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's,</v>

2348
01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.330
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's arguments on both sides.</v>

2349
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.180
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also you have to recognize in</v>

2350
01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:50.360
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you do not want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>official story to be true.</v>

2351
01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And I do not an almost every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens like,</v>

2352
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moon landing or do Ufo landings.</v>

2353
01:31:57.381 --> 01:31:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any crazy shit.</v>

2354
01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I want the crazy shit to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always want the UFO thing to be a real</v>

2355
01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:04.990
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have it.</v>

2356
01:32:04.991 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's believe in aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2357
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than likely that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something else.</v>

2358
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that we're the only thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

2359
01:32:15.691 --> 01:32:17.490
<v Speaker 2>This is a little ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems stupid.</v>

2360
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It seems pretty ignorant and arrogant.</v>

2361
01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that it's what we</v>

2362
01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:28.151
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a most likely far beyond</v>

2363
01:32:28.191 --> 01:32:31.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the places that we can currently travel</v>

2364
01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:34.010
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that by the time they get to</v>

2365
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>a high level of sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're most likely not even organic</v>

2366
01:32:39.231 --> 01:32:41.300
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's the future of</v>

2367
01:32:41.301 --> 01:32:43.280
<v Speaker 1>the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought most of consciousness,</v>

2368
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:44.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe that,</v>

2369
01:32:44.871 --> 01:32:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but I also think there's a real problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the possibility of artificial</v>

2370
01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:51.740
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings are about to create</v>

2371
01:32:51.741 --> 01:32:54.470
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether we recognize it as life or not,</v>

2372
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.960
<v Speaker 1>what artificial life is going to be his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2373
01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Artificial intelligence is going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to change itself,</v>

2374
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:06.250
<v Speaker 1>multiply what human beings have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do in terms of technological</v>

2375
01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:11.390
<v Speaker 1>innovation by a rate of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

2376
01:33:11.391 --> 01:33:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Like in two years they'll be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years of innovation in terms of</v>

2377
01:33:17.301 --> 01:33:20.720
<v Speaker 1>like what we're capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what we're looking at</v>

2378
01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:25.190
<v Speaker 1>now is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last days of biological life.</v>

2379
01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I think a hundred years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years from now,</v>

2380
01:33:28.371 --> 01:33:31.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be biological humans</v>

2381
01:33:31.851 --> 01:33:33.260
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll,</v>

2382
01:33:33.261 --> 01:33:35.250
<v Speaker 1>this'll be an archaic out</v>

2383
01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.780
<v Speaker 2>dainty will change as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:38.780
<v Speaker 2>And I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2385
01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in everything the Bible</v>

2386
01:33:41.191 --> 01:33:42.330
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2387
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>was that in the Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2388
01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.440
<v Speaker 2>so the apocalypse and one of the changes</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we know it,</v>

2389
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I think the apocalypse slope world will</v>
<v Speaker 2>end as we know it,</v>

2390
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:49.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2391
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.390
<v Speaker 1>But I think the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stuff in the Bible,</v>

2392
01:33:51.391 --> 01:33:53.190
<v Speaker 1>that's all local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

2393
01:33:53.191 --> 01:33:55.740
<v Speaker 1>if you lived where Hurricane Katrina</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

2394
01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:57.120
<v Speaker 1>you would think the apocalypse was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2395
01:33:57.330 --> 01:34:00.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were in,</v>

2396
01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:02.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere where something really fucking</v>

2397
01:34:02.371 --> 01:34:05.430
<v Speaker 1>crazy happened and you didn't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with the outside world.</v>

2398
01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:06.750
<v Speaker 1>No cell phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no radio,</v>

2399
01:34:06.751 --> 01:34:08.210
<v Speaker 1>no TV didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2400
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:09.800
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would isolate it.</v>

2401
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what all of our,</v>

2402
01:34:11.391 --> 01:34:15.870
<v Speaker 1>our notions of the apocalypse are there</v>
<v Speaker 1>periodic natural disasters that are</v>

2403
01:34:15.871 --> 01:34:19.980
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they've proven that the entire</v>

2404
01:34:19.981 --> 01:34:24.390
<v Speaker 1>human race was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was down to a few thousand people</v>

2405
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:27.420
<v Speaker 1>because of a supervolcano around 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2406
01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.280
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's been a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those events throughout history where</v>

2407
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:34.530
<v Speaker 1>the human race is brought down to an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2408
01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:37.950
<v Speaker 1>an almost unmanageable level and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>repopulate it.</v>

2409
01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's probably the</v>

2410
01:34:40.471 --> 01:34:43.680
<v Speaker 1>origins of the apocalypse or asteroidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts,</v>

2411
01:34:43.681 --> 01:34:46.450
<v Speaker 1>which are very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've happened all throughout history.</v>

2412
01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:50.510
<v Speaker 2>Ai is going to just eliminate biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

2413
01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give into it too.</v>

2414
01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Then we're going to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to first of all become</v>

2415
01:34:55.770 --> 01:34:58.640
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take something and put it</v>

2416
01:34:58.641 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to enhance us was it's our</v>

2417
01:35:01.401 --> 01:35:04.190
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's our ability to see,</v>

2418
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.930
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start implanting chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>into ourselves and then they're going to</v>

2419
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:11.720
<v Speaker 1>have improved body parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you break your arm and</v>

2420
01:35:11.721 --> 01:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look Danica,</v>

2421
01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:15.740
<v Speaker 1>we can fix your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to take a year.</v>

2422
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:16.671
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2423
01:35:16.671 --> 01:35:21.671
<v Speaker 1>17 broken bones or we can replace it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an arm that works better and it'll</v>

2424
01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>feel just like a regular arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to bring in Mike and Mike</v>

2425
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:28.430
<v Speaker 1>has a fake arm and he's going to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>you how it works and Mike's going to</v>

2426
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so much happier with my arm.</v>

2427
01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Then I was in my face,</v>

2428
01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.790
<v Speaker 5>come up with my real arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then a new drug drug pushers.</v>

2429
01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:34.751
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2430
01:35:34.751 --> 01:35:38.460
<v Speaker 5>this lookout works and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a free vacation to um,</v>

2431
01:35:38.770 --> 01:35:39.940
<v Speaker 5>if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2432
01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:41.410
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've watched some,</v>

2433
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:46.470
<v Speaker 5>I heard some youtube video of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was someone who channels other,</v>

2434
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.190
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those hours,</v>

2435
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.550
<v Speaker 5>I think it was channeling the Palladian</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2436
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:52.570
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For probably totally legit.</v>

2437
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she talked about how it was talking</v>

2438
01:35:54.821 --> 01:35:57.490
<v Speaker 5>about how as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a human race,</v>

2439
01:35:57.491 --> 01:35:59.890
<v Speaker 5>we have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't alter ourselves too much</v>

2440
01:35:59.891 --> 01:36:02.650
<v Speaker 5>because then we won't exist as a human</v>
<v Speaker 5>race because we won't be able to</v>

2441
01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.100
<v Speaker 5>procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that is what keeps our race alive.</v>

2442
01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.140
<v Speaker 5>That's probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2443
01:36:08.141 --> 01:36:09.430
<v Speaker 5>if you think about where we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2444
01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:11.550
<v Speaker 5>but also doesn't it have to</v>

2445
01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.410
<v Speaker 1>keep evolving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2446
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:15.270
<v Speaker 1>if we've got back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2447
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.900
<v Speaker 1>do you think like monkeys when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in trees thrown shitty</v>

2448
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 5>each other or different than that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we gotta be chill.</v>

2449
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise we're going to stop being</v>
<v Speaker 5>monkeys who won't be able to throw shit</v>

2450
01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 5>at each other and Dodge Jaguars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bananas all day.</v>

2451
01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2452
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 5>I think people are afraid of change and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the human race is afraid of</v>

2453
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.790
<v Speaker 5>change too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we're by no means perfect.</v>

2454
01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:35.450
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all,</v>

2455
01:36:35.451 --> 01:36:37.080
<v Speaker 5>everyone's afraid of change,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2456
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Taking a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2457
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:41.030
<v Speaker 5>Having it be different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's worse.</v>

2458
01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:41.811
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick,</v>

2459
01:36:41.811 --> 01:36:43.170
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2460
01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like the hallmark of your whole</v>

2461
01:36:44.721 --> 01:36:46.210
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at your 100% I'm,</v>

2462
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:48.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not afraid of change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not.</v>

2463
01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you have to roll it arm.</v>

2464
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 5>I have a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take the arm.</v>

2465
01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:53.720
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a moment of,</v>

2466
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:55.340
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2467
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was fear of like,</v>

2468
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's the next moment is,</v>

2469
01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's better than I could ever</v>

2470
01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:02.750
<v Speaker 5>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if they were imagined?</v>

2471
01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.700
<v Speaker 1>They'll give you two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you one robot arm that you</v>

2472
01:37:05.701 --> 01:37:08.310
<v Speaker 1>never have to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will always be strong.</v>

2473
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:12.330
<v Speaker 1>You can get that one or you can get one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you constantly have to work out.</v>

2474
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.640
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

2475
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:16.610
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably take the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But which,</v>

2476
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 5>which robot arm would you take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one that you constantly have to work</v>

2477
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.900
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you take the one that's just</v>

2478
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:21.770
<v Speaker 5>perfect?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:23.870
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably take the perfect one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never have to exercise.</v>

2480
01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:26.780
<v Speaker 5>Just Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just jacked all the time.</v>

2481
01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 5>If I wanted a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2482
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:31.370
<v Speaker 5>working out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I still needed to do that for like</v>

2483
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:31.791
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2484
01:37:31.791 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 5>feel good endorphin hormone sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2485
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I would still do that right here by</v>

2486
01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:38.130
<v Speaker 5>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2487
01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.253
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2488
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 5>And I would go do a lot more stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 5>walking around in nature.</v>

2489
01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:48.230
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good answer because that's,</v>

2490
01:37:48.231 --> 01:37:50.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really find enjoyment out of that.</v>

2491
01:37:50.001 --> 01:37:53.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean to find enjoyment out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>intensity level of things and the</v>

2492
01:37:53.301 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 5>confidence that I get or the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2493
01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:00.740
<v Speaker 5>being able to shift my mindset to this</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of like all go all in,</v>

2494
01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 5>not no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no gain.</v>

2495
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.890
<v Speaker 5>That's so cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like I can endure and the confidence</v>

2496
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 5>that comes from enduring and pushing</v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

2497
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.950
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy that development of my mind and</v>

2498
01:38:13.951 --> 01:38:16.200
<v Speaker 5>my discipline and my confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

2499
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm probably just shifting more into</v>

2500
01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 5>enjoying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2501
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 5>things that are a little more peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2502
01:38:23.311 --> 01:38:26.000
<v Speaker 5>So shifting more and to enjoy nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that would be the most fucked up</v>

2504
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:29.520
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you didn't enjoy nature</v>

2505
01:38:29.521 --> 01:38:31.770
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They started replacing body parts and</v>

2506
01:38:31.771 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't give a shit about the forest.</v>

2507
01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:35.040
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be sad.</v>

2508
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 5>I'll be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't take that body part then</v>

2509
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 5>probably wouldn't know until it's too</v>
<v Speaker 5>late.</v>

2510
01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 5>Until they replaced probably going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead before all this is real.</v>

2511
01:38:43.921 --> 01:38:44.840
<v Speaker 5>So that's what I think</v>

2512
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 1>those aliens are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people see Aliens,</v>

2513
01:38:47.251 --> 01:38:48.580
<v Speaker 1>those gray aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gray.</v>

2514
01:38:48.581 --> 01:38:51.180
<v Speaker 1>See guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's just what we're going to</v>

2515
01:38:51.181 --> 01:38:53.130
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

2516
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's natural.</v>

2517
01:38:55.591 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what a monkey is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if we were at some point in</v>

2518
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some ancient hominid like</v>

2519
01:39:01.651 --> 01:39:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pithy gas or whatever,</v>

2520
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Cro Magnon man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we moved on to become homo</v>

2521
01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 1>sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the f.</v>

2522
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.250
<v Speaker 1>If we keep going in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to look like.</v>

2523
01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.480
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna look like a little skinny</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2524
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:13.314
<v Speaker 1>A big heads</v>

2525
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.300
<v Speaker 5>lollipops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2526
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 5>That's what I looked like when I had my</v>
<v Speaker 5>helmet on and I'm in my race suit.</v>

2527
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 5>People are like alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good point,</v>

2528
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I have a regular helmet.</v>

2529
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2530
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.570
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could your helmet is like,</v>

2531
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:31.290
<v Speaker 5>that would be like a big guy wearing an</v>
<v Speaker 5>enormous helmet.</v>

2532
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

2533
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a strong neck?</v>

2534
01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 5>Most must have a wicked now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I do,</v>

2535
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:38.460
<v Speaker 5>do you do exercises with it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need to.</v>

2536
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:40.650
<v Speaker 5>You don't just carry on the helmet</v>
<v Speaker 5>around all the time.</v>

2537
01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.810
<v Speaker 5>It's probably that and just looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking up to my nine foot target for</v>

2538
01:39:45.811 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 5>wall balls and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my neck hurts.</v>

2539
01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

2540
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:50.881
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2541
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:52.530
<v Speaker 5>you're not out of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the car that long.</v>

2542
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.370
<v Speaker 5>It might hurt a little bit when I get</v>
<v Speaker 5>back in an indy car again because the g</v>

2543
01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:57.180
<v Speaker 5>forces are higher.</v>

2544
01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.400
<v Speaker 5>But you also lean your head against the</v>
<v Speaker 5>headrest.</v>

2545
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.200
<v Speaker 5>Usually the only thing that would make</v>
<v Speaker 5>me hurt my,</v>

2546
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:04.560
<v Speaker 5>make my neck hurt a little bit as road</v>
<v Speaker 5>courses at the beginning of the road of</v>

2547
01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:06.510
<v Speaker 5>indycar season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it line to test?</v>

2548
01:40:06.511 --> 01:40:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Because acceleration and deceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing to hold you from like</v>

2549
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.670
<v Speaker 5>your neck going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your head going forward.</v>

2550
01:40:11.671 --> 01:40:13.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean there is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not to the level that you would</v>

2551
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.180
<v Speaker 5>drive that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2552
01:40:15.181 --> 01:40:18.000
<v Speaker 5>there's just a device that is in case</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in an accident,</v>

2553
01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:19.740
<v Speaker 5>but it still moves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2554
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:21.930
<v Speaker 5>holding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>holding your neck forward and backwards</v>

2555
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:25.950
<v Speaker 5>is a lot more sore than side to side</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because you have a head rest so we</v>

2556
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:26.430
<v Speaker 5>can use it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Get out of a long race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your whole body tired?</v>

2558
01:40:29.171 --> 01:40:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2559
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in stock cars it's,</v>

2560
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really a lot about dehydration.</v>

2561
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Dehydration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:37.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 130,</v>

2563
01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:40.190
<v Speaker 5>140 degrees in there now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a tube or you started to,</v>

2564
01:40:40.191 --> 01:40:42.660
<v Speaker 5>I wonder from a to camelback that goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the front of my helmet,</v>

2565
01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:44.720
<v Speaker 5>a couple of blowers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the back blower,</v>

2566
01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:47.400
<v Speaker 5>a helmet blower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that are cooler air,</v>

2567
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 5>but I'm here to tell you it's still hard</v>
<v Speaker 5>to sell on there or did I imagine?</v>

2568
01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2569
01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a fire in a gigantic iron</v>
<v Speaker 1>block</v>

2570
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:55.090
<v Speaker 2>in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.670
<v Speaker 2>When the water and oil temperature is</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 degrees.</v>

2572
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2573
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 2>it sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a greenhouse in the car.</v>

2574
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.810
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It runs right underneath you to do.</v>

2575
01:41:04.811 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>You think you're going to miss it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question.</v>

2576
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this just the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2577
01:41:09.521 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I going to miss the intensity?</v>

2578
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to miss certain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2579
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I will miss some of it a little</v>

2580
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and again I'm driving down the</v>

2581
01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:17.760
<v Speaker 2>road and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2582
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably miss it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2583
01:41:21.150 --> 01:41:23.640
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2584
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.250
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a decisive person,</v>

2585
01:41:26.251 --> 01:41:28.140
<v Speaker 2>so I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're good.</v>

2586
01:41:28.170 --> 01:41:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering more if I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss the,</v>

2587
01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.140
<v Speaker 2>the intensity level of the job and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highs being so high,</v>

2588
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but the lows being low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2589
01:41:39.361 --> 01:41:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you get the highest right and</v>

2590
01:41:41.371 --> 01:41:43.950
<v Speaker 2>the duality of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the environment.</v>

2591
01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if I'll miss some of that</v>

2592
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:50.610
<v Speaker 2>and if whatever I do on the side will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

2593
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:54.290
<v Speaker 2>What is the age that most people retire</v>
<v Speaker 2>from racing?</v>

2594
01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm 35 I'm a slightly young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say early forties.</v>

2595
01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:03.050
<v Speaker 2>After a while they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their body just takes too much and</v>

2596
01:42:03.051 --> 01:42:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you're just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly,</v>

2597
01:42:04.671 --> 01:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's Nascar,</v>

2598
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:08.570
<v Speaker 2>he was just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2599
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:10.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's my feeling anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2600
01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you're gone for 40 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year on the road and these,</v>

2601
01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really luxurious places of the world on</v>

2602
01:42:16.371 --> 01:42:19.430
<v Speaker 2>the barbecue world tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like grilling out of your bus and living</v>

2603
01:42:19.431 --> 01:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>out of a bus for most of your life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2604
01:42:21.981 --> 01:42:26.981
<v Speaker 2>on the road in and out of airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours of nothing to do on the weekends</v>

2605
01:42:27.351 --> 01:42:28.580
<v Speaker 2>while you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2606
01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.640
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just kind of the grind.</v>

2607
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:34.460
<v Speaker 2>So I think he kind of just get a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>worn out.</v>

2608
01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I could only imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2609
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean even like you were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews and stuff like yeah,</v>

2610
01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:45.041
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy doing interviews that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>based around how's your car this</v>

2611
01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:45.441
<v Speaker 2>weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2612
01:42:45.441 --> 01:42:47.280
<v Speaker 2>There's just so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really weren't.</v>

2613
01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:52.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's fun for me to talk about working</v>
<v Speaker 2>out or cooking or wine,</v>

2614
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.581
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
01:42:52.581 --> 01:42:54.230
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just interesting.</v>

2616
01:42:54.231 --> 01:42:59.231
<v Speaker 2>Or aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only imagine the boring grind of</v>

2617
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the media tour that you must have to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through when you're racing all the time.</v>

2618
01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you what Diana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2619
01:43:05.851 --> 01:43:08.120
<v Speaker 2>You are moving quite fast out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2620
01:43:08.121 --> 01:43:11.570
<v Speaker 2>You have over performer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the uh,</v>

2621
01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.850
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old south park episode.</v>

2622
01:43:13.851 --> 01:43:16.820
<v Speaker 2>They had a bunch of Nascar drivers on</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Park and you know,</v>

2623
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.130
<v Speaker 2>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was when um,</v>

2624
01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:24.770
<v Speaker 2>cartman's trying to be poor and stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he could race in Nascar and he was</v>

2625
01:43:24.951 --> 01:43:29.951
<v Speaker 2>sponsored by badges cell and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate a ton of ad is still to make them as</v>

2626
01:43:30.951 --> 01:43:33.710
<v Speaker 2>stupid as he could and you realize that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more stupid he got,</v>

2627
01:43:33.711 --> 01:43:35.610
<v Speaker 2>the more money spent in more in daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>

2628
01:43:35.610 --> 01:43:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you got poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just bought like jet skis and</v>

2629
01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I think he says at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danica,</v>

2630
01:43:44.331 --> 01:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not having both halves porn</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid as I am.</v>

2631
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were in it.</v>

2632
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in it.</v>

2633
01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Did you use your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2634
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

2635
01:43:52.170 --> 01:43:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Somebody else does all their own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on the simpsons that year too,</v>

2636
01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.460
<v Speaker 5>and I did my voiceover for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But for,</v>

2637
01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.190
<v Speaker 5>for South Park now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you love it?</v>

2638
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.630
<v Speaker 5>I was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2639
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:04.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't care what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're on a show,</v>

2640
01:44:04.611 --> 01:44:05.780
<v Speaker 5>it's flattering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2641
01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 5>They to make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make tv in a different capacity means</v>

2642
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:10.770
<v Speaker 5>you're being noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2643
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:12.500
<v Speaker 5>especially South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2644
01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.290
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the funniest show that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever existed.</v>

2645
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially like all time.</v>

2646
01:44:17.391 --> 01:44:18.070
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2647
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:20.240
<v Speaker 5>all the episodes they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2648
01:44:20.241 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even make sense how creative</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are.</v>

2649
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:27.370
<v Speaker 5>That's what I was thinking is how</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just insightful ahead of things</v>

2650
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:31.010
<v Speaker 5>a lot and definitely clever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with there,</v>

2651
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:33.010
<v Speaker 5>the delivery of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2652
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:34.440
<v Speaker 5>They're wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Completely bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of car do you drive in regular</v>

2654
01:44:38.691 --> 01:44:40.100
<v Speaker 5>life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please don't say like a Prius.</v>

2655
01:44:40.570 --> 01:44:41.403
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Throw it.</v>

2656
01:44:41.650 --> 01:44:42.471
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2657
01:44:42.471 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 5>I just drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other day I was throwing some things</v>

2658
01:44:44.391 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 5>into the recycling bin and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to do my part because</v>

2659
01:44:46.851 --> 01:44:48.470
<v Speaker 5>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I burned fuel for a living.</v>

2660
01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2661
01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 5>In terms of how much fossil fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if you could see a chart,</v>

2662
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.120
<v Speaker 5>how much fossil fuel the average person</v>
<v Speaker 5>burns.</v>

2663
01:44:56.210 --> 01:44:59.820
<v Speaker 5>I would not be doing well on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would not be a,</v>

2664
01:44:59.821 --> 01:45:04.821
<v Speaker 5>I would not do well with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tree huggers are vegans of the world.</v>

2665
01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 5>All the people loving animals like me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm all those people.</v>

2666
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:14.030
<v Speaker 5>I love the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try and eat vegetables most of the</v>

2667
01:45:14.031 --> 01:45:15.170
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

2668
01:45:15.171 --> 01:45:17.750
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I also don't do my part when it comes to</v>

2669
01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 5>my job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of car do you drive?</v>

2670
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.990
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've had cars for years through um,</v>

2671
01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 5>through the manufacturer.</v>

2672
01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.670
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2673
01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 5>this past year we were sponsored by</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ford.</v>

2674
01:45:27.591 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 5>So I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a ford expedition,</v>

2675
01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.770
<v Speaker 5>e l I didn't know what each element it</v>
<v Speaker 5>means extra long.</v>

2676
01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had extra space in the back.</v>

2677
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

2678
01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hook you up with a Mustang,</v>

2679
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:41.030
<v Speaker 5>shelby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2680
01:45:41.031 --> 01:45:43.240
<v Speaker 5>that's not very practical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three fifties.</v>

2681
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.760
<v Speaker 5>We weren't even allowed to customize</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2682
01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:48.240
<v Speaker 5>customize the wheels on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

2683
01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.430
<v Speaker 5>it was bare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bare bones because they,</v>

2684
01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.150
<v Speaker 5>that was part of the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're alive.</v>

2685
01:45:53.151 --> 01:45:56.270
<v Speaker 5>You get a car but you can't get anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>dressed up.</v>

2686
01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.800
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could have had a raptor I guess,</v>

2687
01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:05.020
<v Speaker 5>but like trucks aren't really me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever better than the l</v>

2688
01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:08.930
<v Speaker 5>a yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2689
01:46:08.931 --> 01:46:11.600
<v Speaker 5>and then I had a Tahoe and I drove for</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chevy before that.</v>

2690
01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.460
<v Speaker 5>I would think that you would want</v>
<v Speaker 5>something fast.</v>

2691
01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:15.380
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that I a,</v>

2692
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:18.560
<v Speaker 5>I bought my first car and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>last car I bought.</v>

2693
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:23.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A long time ago I bought a Mercedes ml</v>

2694
01:46:23.121 --> 01:46:25.790
<v Speaker 5>63 amg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a suv,</v>

2695
01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:28.400
<v Speaker 5>souped up suv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a long time ago.</v>

2696
01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.770
<v Speaker 5>I was like 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2697
01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.990
<v Speaker 5>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought a range rover.</v>

2698
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 5>So since then you've just been using</v>
<v Speaker 5>manufacturer cars from the sponsors</v>

2699
01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.640
<v Speaker 5>because they're free dollars and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2700
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:42.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever is free is free.</v>

2701
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:44.750
<v Speaker 5>Is that like a part of the contract?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this the only car you're allowed to</v>

2702
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:47.000
<v Speaker 5>drive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2703
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.863
<v Speaker 5>probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2704
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:50.670
<v Speaker 5>but that was the only car you drove to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the race track?</v>

2705
01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.930
<v Speaker 5>Probably the one driving your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>company car.</v>

2709
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 5>But do you think that once you retire</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't build it straight and have to go</v>

2726
01:47:36.031 --> 01:47:38.700
<v Speaker 5>to school for engineering.</v>

2746
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 5>it's not that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

2747
01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 5>it just feeds your testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanical,</v>

2748
01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.150
<v Speaker 5>mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They feel it's analog.</v>

2749
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my car would be good off the line.</v>

2750
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.880
<v Speaker 5>I bought a Lamborghini along while back</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2751
01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:34.980
<v Speaker 5>it didn't have a cup holder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was like,</v>

2752
01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:37.770
<v Speaker 5>well this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not practical.</v>

2753
01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I bought the Mercedes</v>

2754
01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:45.600
<v Speaker 5>and that had a cup holder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a couple of cup holders.</v>

2755
01:48:45.601 --> 01:48:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was good,</v>

2756
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:47.580
<v Speaker 5>but then it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2757
01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:50.700
<v Speaker 5>technology evolved and it didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bluetooth to play my music.</v>

2758
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:51.211
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2759
01:48:51.211 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to have to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2760
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.070
<v Speaker 5>And that was when I started driving for</v>
<v Speaker 5>a chevy.</v>

2761
01:48:56.071 --> 01:49:00.000
<v Speaker 5>And then I got a Tahoe and I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I got a [inaudible].</v>

2762
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.910

<v Speaker 5>I didn't ask for one.</v>

2763
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:07.900
<v Speaker 5>How could you not want one driving</v>
<v Speaker 5>force?</v>

<v Speaker 5>If I wanted a corvette,</v>

2765
01:49:10.081 --> 01:49:11.050

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 5>what about shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like shoes.</v>

2780
01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.510
<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2781
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 5>a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely a girl,</v>

2782
01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 5>but not purses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A curl</v>

2783
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.420
<v Speaker 2>my own hair today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

2784
01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do makeup?</v>

2785
01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2786
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>My shoulder hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hairspray.</v>

2787
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.210
<v Speaker 2>What does this stuff now I'm very much a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>

2788
01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what if people ask me what it,</v>

2789
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:04.190
<v Speaker 2>what is it about you that people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be surprised?</v>

2790
01:50:04.191 --> 01:50:07.100
<v Speaker 2>And I'm telling them like much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>girly away from the track than you'd</v>

2791
01:50:07.101 --> 01:50:10.370
<v Speaker 2>think because I'm really aggressive at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the track and I don't look very happy</v>

2792
01:50:10.371 --> 01:50:14.990
<v Speaker 2>and away from the track I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try and be funny and I smile more and</v>

2793
01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more relaxed.</v>

2794
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Are you surprised that with all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

2795
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:24.490
<v Speaker 1>success and all the attention that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten from your success as the</v>

2796
01:50:24.531 --> 01:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>only woman on your level in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in professional racing,</v>

2797
01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:30.470
<v Speaker 1>are you surprised that more women aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering in,</v>

2798
01:50:30.471 --> 01:50:33.710
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't sort of opened the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think that it's such a</v>

2799
01:50:33.711 --> 01:50:38.711
<v Speaker 1>specialized and unique thing to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something that a lot of</v>

2800
01:50:39.621 --> 01:50:40.700
<v Speaker 1>women gravitate towards?</v>

2801
01:50:41.690 --> 01:50:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I used to say that for a hundred men</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came through,</v>

2802
01:50:44.361 --> 01:50:46.910
<v Speaker 2>if you found a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes a hundred to find a good one</v>

2803
01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.570
<v Speaker 2>that comes pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to go through a hundred women takes</v>

2804
01:50:50.571 --> 01:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot longer because there are so few of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2805
01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more coming through,</v>

2806
01:50:55.191 --> 01:50:56.330
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
01:50:56.331 --> 01:50:59.180
<v Speaker 2>over time it just takes a lot longer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find good ones.</v>

2808
01:50:59.181 --> 01:51:00.560
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2809
01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back to a,</v>

2810
01:51:03.801 --> 01:51:05.900
<v Speaker 2>this is my ego talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back to,</v>

2811
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:08.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time ago,</v>

2812
01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:09.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2813
01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:12.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Newman was still alive and we were</v>

2814
01:51:12.261 --> 01:51:14.060
<v Speaker 2>on a late night show together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably Letterman,</v>

2815
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:18.140
<v Speaker 2>and he was asked before I went on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the first guest if there was</v>

2816
01:51:18.141 --> 01:51:20.720
<v Speaker 2>going to be another driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another girl that comes through that</v>

2817
01:51:20.721 --> 01:51:22.640
<v Speaker 2>compares to me and he said he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think so.</v>

2818
01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there will be no shit.</v>

2819
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew his shit.</v>

2820
01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2821
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you're unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there will be someday.</v>

2822
01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I meet a lot of women like you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mma.</v>

2823
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's those savages that enter into</v>

2824
01:51:39.671 --> 01:51:43.480
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women that fall wind up fighting in</v>

2825
01:51:43.481 --> 01:51:45.220
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>

2826
01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm kind of stunned at how many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them there are.</v>

2827
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say they're like you,</v>

2828
01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

2829
01:51:54.311 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 1>unique people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does take wild chances.</v>

2830
01:51:57.851 --> 01:52:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean the type of person that is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>holly home or someone like that.</v>

2831
01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I think the big difference lies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of people that are</v>

2832
01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:05.270
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

2833
01:52:05.271 --> 01:52:06.510
<v Speaker 2>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2834
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:08.150
<v Speaker 2>assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bold,</v>

2835
01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:12.890
<v Speaker 2>but to then be able to keep it together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2836
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:14.720
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up above their shoulders.</v>

2837
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:17.030
<v Speaker 2>That's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the difference.</v>

2838
01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Keep it together in the pressure of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

2839
01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pressure of whatever moment is</v>

2840
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:25.550
<v Speaker 2>have that you're having whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressures are being put on you around an</v>

2841
01:52:25.551 --> 01:52:27.410
<v Speaker 2>event or for one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are,</v>

2842
01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:30.800
<v Speaker 2>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right people around you being able</v>

2843
01:52:30.801 --> 01:52:34.550
<v Speaker 2>to filter the shit and let him like keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good,</v>

2844
01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:36.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s keep your own confidence up.</v>

2845
01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2846
01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the hardest part.</v>

2847
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:44.270
<v Speaker 2>And then being able to flip that switch</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're performing to,</v>

2848
01:52:44.271 --> 01:52:47.350
<v Speaker 2>of course then not have doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2849
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:48.830
<v Speaker 2>more confidence.</v>

2850
01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I think everything that you've said</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be mirrored by what a woman who</v>

2851
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:56.600
<v Speaker 1>competes at the very highest levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMA would say.</v>

2852
01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I think they would find all those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be factors.</v>

2853
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2854
01:53:01.851 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really stunned that you literally</v>

2855
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:06.320
<v Speaker 1>are the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

2856
01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:08.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a incredibly rare position.</v>

2857
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever stop and think about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you weren't there?</v>

2858
01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's forbidden for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2859
01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've moans mostly only thought about it</v>

2860
01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:23.110
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have I thought about what I've done in</v>

2861
01:53:23.111 --> 01:53:26.650
<v Speaker 2>the sport because it's stuff that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't done before.</v>

2862
01:53:26.651 --> 01:53:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And usually my answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that someday we'll look back and,</v>

2863
01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to have a little bit more</v>

2864
01:53:32.741 --> 01:53:34.930
<v Speaker 2>perspective on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now I'm just kind of in the</v>

2865
01:53:34.931 --> 01:53:35.700
<v Speaker 2>middle of it.</v>

2866
01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:36.533
<v Speaker 6>MMM.</v>

2867
01:53:37.230 --> 01:53:38.670
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about it like that.</v>

2868
01:53:38.671 --> 01:53:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Like what if I was never there?</v>

2869
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2871
01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were never there,</v>

2872
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:47.890
<v Speaker 1>what it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just be constantly a boys' club</v>

2873
01:53:47.891 --> 01:53:48.910
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2874
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

2875
01:53:50.201 --> 01:53:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really fascinated by complete</v>

2876
01:53:52.571 --> 01:53:53.290
<v Speaker 1>outliers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2877
01:53:53.290 --> 01:53:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a complete outlier in that</v>

2878
01:53:55.001 --> 01:53:56.350
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2879
01:53:56.351 --> 01:53:58.720
<v Speaker 1>there's not like 30 girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2880
01:53:58.721 --> 01:54:00.760
<v Speaker 1>there's 500 men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's 30 girls.</v>

2881
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Know How many men are Nascar drivers?</v>

2882
01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the field is 40.</v>

2883
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 40 men,</v>

2884
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:09.020
<v Speaker 1>one check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2885
01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do it.</v>

2886
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Are there any women that are trying,</v>

2887
01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.880
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lower formula is other,</v>

2888
01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:19.560
<v Speaker 2>some that do some part time stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to think of someone has</v>

2889
01:54:19.561 --> 01:54:23.460
<v Speaker 2>done like a full season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2890
01:54:24.690 --> 01:54:28.440
<v Speaker 2>back in indy car there was some girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did more.</v>

2891
01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:30.570
<v Speaker 2>There were like at one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one indy 500,</v>

2892
01:54:30.571 --> 01:54:34.050
<v Speaker 2>there was like five of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most of the time there's none</v>

2893
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:36.960
<v Speaker 6>or one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2894
01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 2>comes in waves.</v>

2895
01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2896
01:54:41.421 --> 01:54:44.690
<v Speaker 1>do you think that when you stop and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look back on your career,</v>

2897
01:54:44.691 --> 01:54:49.691
<v Speaker 1>you'll take into account and maybe have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more objective sense of what an impact</v>

2898
01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:53.450
<v Speaker 1>that you've had?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2899
01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2900
01:54:55.351 --> 01:55:00.351
<v Speaker 2>But I need distance right from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to gain perspective that way.</v>

2901
01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2902
01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure in your career too,</v>

2903
01:55:04.651 --> 01:55:07.920
<v Speaker 2>like I mean to be able to identify the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you've done,</v>

2904
01:55:07.921 --> 01:55:11.460
<v Speaker 2>the influence you've had over people</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the conversations you've had with</v>

2905
01:55:11.461 --> 01:55:13.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the things in business you've done.</v>

2906
01:55:13.591 --> 01:55:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to see when you're in the</v>

2907
01:55:15.811 --> 01:55:17.800
<v Speaker 2>middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2908
01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to look at that?</v>

2909
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:21.263
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2910
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Cause I don't want to get distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2911
01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 2>That's why people don't in the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it doesn't matter.</v>

2912
01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>

2913
01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:30.700
<v Speaker 1>when I'm doing a lot of people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is very,</v>

2914
01:55:30.701 --> 01:55:34.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just tag it to be a woman that does</v>

2915
01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the thing that many men think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most manly things</v>

2916
01:55:38.161 --> 01:55:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you could do other than fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe football.</v>

2917
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like race,</v>

2918
01:55:42.151 --> 01:55:43.690
<v Speaker 1>car driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a little boy.</v>

2919
01:55:43.691 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>What do you want</v>

2920
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.830
<v Speaker 3>to be when you grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy army or a race car driver.</v>

2921
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.890
<v Speaker 3>But that's just lightening McQueen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2922
01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like a natural thing for men</v>

2923
01:55:52.621 --> 01:55:53.150
<v Speaker 3>to gravitate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2924
01:55:53.150 --> 01:55:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad always said he was just like,</v>

2925
01:55:55.041 --> 01:55:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had cursed with three girls in the</v>

2926
01:55:57.891 --> 01:55:59.810
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes my mom and then me and my sister</v>

2927
01:55:59.811 --> 01:56:00.820
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm Dad,</v>

2928
01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 3>what more did you want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what more did you want with it?</v>

2929
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:05.630
<v Speaker 2>If you had a boy as a son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what was he going to do that's</v>

2930
01:56:05.631 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooler than what I'm doing.</v>

2931
01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:10.700
<v Speaker 1>He'd be out there banging chicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's missing.</v>

2932
01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 2>You think my dad would think that was</v>

2933
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:17.450
<v Speaker 3>cool</v>
<v Speaker 3>if his son was banging chicks?</v>

2934
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I would think probably that's my boy.</v>

2935
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Scared shitless for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2936
01:56:25.831 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think still in my adult life.</v>

2937
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:29.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like er,</v>

2938
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.140
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the courage to let you go to</v>

2939
01:56:32.141 --> 01:56:36.880
<v Speaker 1>England by herself when you were 16 I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that and race over there on another</v>

2940
01:56:36.881 --> 01:56:39.760
<v Speaker 1>continent all the way across an ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

2941
01:56:39.761 --> 01:56:42.400
<v Speaker 1>You did get hurt to get to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take forever.</v>

2942
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bold.</v>

2943
01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.210
<v Speaker 2>What is the worst crash you've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in?</v>

2944
01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:51.470
<v Speaker 2>A my first crash in indy cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My very first race.</v>

2945
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of paralleled getting an a go kart</v>

2946
01:56:53.511 --> 01:56:54.830
<v Speaker 2>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a big crash,</v>

2947
01:56:54.831 --> 01:56:55.641
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2948
01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:56.421
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homestead,</v>

2949
01:56:56.421 --> 01:57:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Miami and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a big accident and I was</v>

2950
01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:04.130
<v Speaker 2>running low and someone was sliding down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the track that had damage and they</v>

2951
01:57:04.131 --> 01:57:08.990
<v Speaker 2>clipped my right rear and shot me up</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the wall head first and um,</v>

2952
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:12.530
<v Speaker 2>slid down the track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't remember that part.</v>

2953
01:57:12.531 --> 01:57:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember getting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember walking to the</v>

2954
01:57:15.051 --> 01:57:16.610
<v Speaker 2>ambulance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's footage of all of it.</v>

2955
01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:19.700
<v Speaker 2>And I walked the wrong way away from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambulance.</v>

2956
01:57:19.701 --> 01:57:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I was walking the opposite direction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I was kind of like stumbling</v>

2957
01:57:22.851 --> 01:57:26.150
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got back to the back to the,</v>

2958
01:57:26.210 --> 01:57:26.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2959
01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:30.290
<v Speaker 2>medical truck and then I got in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently I was very repetitive on the</v>

2960
01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:32.810
<v Speaker 2>way to the hospital and I kept asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2961
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:36.500
<v Speaker 2>did it look bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

2962
01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.780
<v Speaker 2>you have asked us that a few times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2963
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:40.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just stop.</v>

2964
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2965
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:43.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a severe concussion.</v>

2966
01:57:43.431 --> 01:57:46.490
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people ask the same questions over</v>

2967
01:57:46.491 --> 01:57:47.270
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

2968
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then I've had one,</v>

2969
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:51.500
<v Speaker 2>let's hope I don't have a cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you probably do.</v>

2970
01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I probably do a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2971
01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:55.730
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The devil touch Oh,</v>

2972
01:57:55.810 --> 01:57:59.240
<v Speaker 1>matter makes you more risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it does,</v>

2973
01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:00.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2974
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:02.380
<v Speaker 1>That sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things it does,</v>

2975
01:58:02.381 --> 01:58:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it makes people more impulsive.</v>

2976
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Do UFC people get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2977
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:09.460
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that video?</v>

2978
01:58:09.461 --> 01:58:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they doing studies in UFC like they</v>

2979
01:58:11.431 --> 01:58:16.200
<v Speaker 2>did in the nfl with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing tests after they've passed</v>

2980
01:58:16.201 --> 01:58:20.310
<v Speaker 2>away to know if like they had cte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what nfl had they,</v>

2981
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:22.800
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a study that came out last</v>

2982
01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:25.290
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like almost all but one out of a</v>

2983
01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:26.580
<v Speaker 2>hundred and some had cte.</v>

2984
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:27.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2985
01:58:27.461 --> 01:58:28.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget the numbers,</v>

2986
01:58:28.931 --> 01:58:30.730
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was only like one or two people</v>

2987
01:58:30.731 --> 01:58:31.780
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2988
01:58:31.781 --> 01:58:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2989
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:35.560
<v Speaker 1>a hundred odd hasn't done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UFC hasn't been around as long as</v>

2990
01:58:35.561 --> 01:58:37.690
<v Speaker 1>the NFL obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

2991
01:58:37.691 --> 01:58:40.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not dealing with the same data</v>

2992
01:58:40.241 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure when people</v>

2993
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.110
<v Speaker 3>do pass away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find it.</v>

2994
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 3>It's just varying levels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard they actually have a test now</v>

2995
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:48.300
<v Speaker 3>for cte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2998
01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Making excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just go extra crazy.</v>

2999
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why I'm gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naked</v>

<v Speaker 3>This question,</v>

3003
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:19.720
<v Speaker 3>did you see the video that just came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a couple of days ago from the guy</v>

3004
01:59:19.721 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 3>that hit the off ramp and went flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air and landed in a house in</v>

3005
01:59:23.861 --> 01:59:27.040
<v Speaker 3>the second floor of a house?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His car's poking out the side,</v>

3006
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:29.230
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't do it again if he had to.</v>

3007
01:59:29.231 --> 01:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3008
01:59:30.161 --> 01:59:31.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just total random.</v>

3009
01:59:31.271 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Crazy luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is hilarious.</v>

3010
01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see if you,</v>

3011
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:41.200
<v Speaker 3>once you find it then go to crystal Lee</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>

3012
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Cause Deleah had a hilarious meme that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created,</v>

3013
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:48.880
<v Speaker 3>but this car hit this hit like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier.</v>

3014
01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Hit one of those cement barriers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally got launched into the air and</v>

3015
01:59:52.961 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 3>stuck into the second floor of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

3016

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3021
02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:13.270
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully it's front wheel drive and</v>

3022
02:00:13.271 --> 02:00:15.910
<v Speaker 3>they could keep accelerating to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little further and so they can get out</v>

3023
02:00:15.911 --> 02:00:17.990
<v Speaker 3>of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's spoken like a true race cars,</v>

<v Speaker 2>8,000 miles.</v>

3142
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:57.261
<v Speaker 2>I was on my third set of brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put stiffer sway bars in it so that</v>

3143
02:04:59.881 --> 02:05:02.400
<v Speaker 2>it would handle better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3144
02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.900
<v Speaker 2>it was uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody even barely uses the full speed</v>

3185
02:06:26.301 --> 02:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>of that here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3187
02:06:28.530 --> 02:06:30.170
<v Speaker 2>so I was actually going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

3188
02:06:30.171 --> 02:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>

3189
02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>a road and track,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3190
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>cover article where I test drove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3191
02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a porsche,</v>

3192
02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>a corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3193
02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a viper of some sort,</v>

3194
02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>a viper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was,</v>

3195
02:06:45.891 --> 02:06:47.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3196
02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:50.720
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Lamborghini Mercia logo and I'll,</v>

3197
02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience was the,</v>

3198
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.880
<v Speaker 2>the Porsche was loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this one.</v>

3199
02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:59.630
<v Speaker 2>The corvette was tight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which meant it was the most comfortable</v>

3200
02:06:59.631 --> 02:07:01.670
<v Speaker 2>and stable to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3201
02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3202
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a viper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Viper was just light on its feet,</v>

3203
02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Kinda just didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't very stuck and it was just</v>

3204
02:07:09.801 --> 02:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>kind of clunky.</v>

3205
02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>It's about seven or eight years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>

3206
02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:14.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least.</v>

3207
02:07:14.601 --> 02:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:15.931
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3209
02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:16.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3210
02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:18.890
<v Speaker 2>the Lamborghini was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was also light.</v>

3211
02:07:18.891 --> 02:07:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just went so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty well balanced,</v>

3212
02:07:22.191 --> 02:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>but probably a little on the loose side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3213
02:07:24.090 --> 02:07:25.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not even be joppa link.</v>

3242
02:08:39.041 --> 02:08:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3243
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:40.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would think that was what I was</v>

3244
02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:42.840
<v Speaker 3>reading to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3245
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:44.740
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's good thought,</v>

3246
02:08:44.741 --> 02:08:47.620
<v Speaker 3>but rather have black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me guess.</v>

3247
02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3248
02:08:49.710 --> 02:08:52.500
<v Speaker 3>black tinted windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

3249
02:08:52.501 --> 02:08:53.334
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

3250
02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.740
<v Speaker 3>black wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black whoa.</v>

3251
02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a darth vader type thing.</v>

3252
02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:00.490
<v Speaker 3>So bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More.</v>

3253
02:09:00.491 --> 02:09:03.230
<v Speaker 3>More masculine than feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3254
02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to figure out what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3255
02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:06.310
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

3256
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:08.920
<v Speaker 3>That's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's an old one too,</v>

3257
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:11.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No worries.</v>

3258
02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Those crows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone looks gross.</v>

3259
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 3>The other one didn't look so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more of a darker pink.</v>

3260
02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.990
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to find a chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget it.</v>

3261
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:22.270
<v Speaker 3>She's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to hate it no matter what.</v>

3262
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.000
<v Speaker 3>She wants Darth Vader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink corvettes that,</v>

3263
02:09:25.001 --> 02:09:26.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angela Andrew,</v>

3264
02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I saw her the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw her driving that.</v>

3265
02:09:30.131 --> 02:09:35.131
<v Speaker 3>Do know who Angelina's Angelina is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who when I moved to California in</v>

3266
02:09:35.771 --> 02:09:38.740
<v Speaker 3>the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she used to have these billboards all</v>

3267
02:09:38.741 --> 02:09:40.450
<v Speaker 3>around California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of what?</v>

3268
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:41.670
<v Speaker 3>It's her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3269
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:44.670
<v Speaker 3>her like in her bikini.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3270
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:48.790
<v Speaker 3>like she would just say her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just say her name and her phone</v>

3271
02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:50.330
<v Speaker 3>number and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3272
02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.000
<v Speaker 3>he knows those billboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3273
02:09:52.001 --> 02:09:52.860
<v Speaker 3>shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3274
02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's her.</v>

3275
02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:55.990
<v Speaker 3>And so these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd be like,</v>

3276
02:09:55.991 --> 02:09:57.670
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is Angelina?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody would be like,</v>

3277
02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.530
<v Speaker 3>aw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like this local celebrity.</v>

3278
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:03.850
<v Speaker 3>And so she apparently is just a wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>lady who,</v>

3279
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:07.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of her time here has done that.</v>

3280
02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Just got these big billboards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3281
02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.790
<v Speaker 3>She's doing a split on top of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corvette.</v>

3282
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3283
02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:21.670
<v Speaker 3>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe she kept doing it so she still</v>

3284
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:22.620
<v Speaker 3>does it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3285
02:10:22.630 --> 02:10:24.280
<v Speaker 3>you still have a billboard?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a billboard,</v>

3286
02:10:24.281 --> 02:10:26.410
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has at least three different print</v>

3287
02:10:26.411 --> 02:10:29.530
<v Speaker 3>corvettes and all I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen her really recently in the</v>

3288
02:10:29.531 --> 02:10:31.570
<v Speaker 3>pink corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3289
02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely know.</v>

3290
02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

3291
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:35.330
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more like,</v>

3292
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of your sub do actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got the Lamborghini and I had to</v>

3293
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:43.730
<v Speaker 2>go pick my sister up from the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3294
02:10:43.731 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 2>There's nowhere to put your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your bags.</v>

3295
02:10:45.710 --> 02:10:47.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a briefcase for,</v>

3296
02:10:48.110 --> 02:10:48.980
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3297
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>trunk and it's in the front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of silly.</v>

3298
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I realized that people normally</v>

3299
02:10:55.701 --> 02:10:58.490
<v Speaker 2>get these cars so they can just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of take it out to dinner.</v>

3300
02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be looked at so I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

3301
02:11:00.831 --> 02:11:04.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm more likely to take it to go get</v>
<v Speaker 2>groceries than I am to go to dinner.</v>

3302
02:11:04.850 --> 02:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>So I realized it was pretty pointless</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

3303
02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the car for you.</v>

3304
02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 2>And if I want performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go do my job</v>

3305
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:14.680
<v Speaker 3>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For now.</v>

3306
02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:16.540
<v Speaker 3>But when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm trying to look.</v>

3307
02:11:16.570 --> 02:11:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to keep trying to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3308
02:11:17.921 --> 02:11:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you're looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward after these next two</v>

3309
02:11:21.011 --> 02:11:21.550
<v Speaker 3>races.</v>

3310
02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to visit again in a year,</v>

3311
02:11:23.410 --> 02:11:25.230
<v Speaker 2>a year from now and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

3312
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it all out.</v>

3313
02:11:28.690 --> 02:11:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3314
02:11:29.921 --> 02:11:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>

3315
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:34.360
<v Speaker 3>well in a year from now then the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>corvette zr one will be available.</v>

3316
02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:39.420
<v Speaker 3>750 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid 62 seconds.</v>

3317
02:11:40.230 --> 02:11:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to use it,</v>

3318
02:11:41.411 --> 02:11:44.050
<v Speaker 3>so you might use the zero 1650 speeding</v>
<v Speaker 3>tickets.</v>

3319
02:11:44.051 --> 02:11:45.340
<v Speaker 3>So he talking to you negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

3320
02:11:45.610 --> 02:11:46.443
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

3321
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Nobody get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody got a speeding ticket for getting</v>

3322
02:11:49.551 --> 02:11:51.710
<v Speaker 2>the speed limit to quickly though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

3323
02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:53.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they probably would pull you over</v>

3324
02:11:53.571 --> 02:11:54.320
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

3325
02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I got a funny story about when I got</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled over when I was 16 with my</v>

3326
02:11:57.111 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Mustang Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was picking my girlfriend up and</v>

3327
02:11:59.931 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 2>pulling out of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her off of her street onto the main</v>

3328
02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:06.890
<v Speaker 2>street and it was wet out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I kind of got it going and kicked</v>

3329
02:12:06.891 --> 02:12:10.070
<v Speaker 2>it sideways a little bit and looked in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rear view mirror at the stoplight.</v>

3330
02:12:10.130 --> 02:12:13.550
<v Speaker 2>And there's a cop sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he comes for me.</v>

3331
02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:16.010
<v Speaker 2>So I turned on the first road I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>

3332
02:12:16.011 --> 02:12:20.360
<v Speaker 2>So I make a left drive down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fricking dead end.</v>

3333
02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:25.330
<v Speaker 2>So I pull into a driveway and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>slouched down real low and the COP Kinda</v>

3334
02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:27.740
<v Speaker 2>drives around and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes out from the house,</v>

3335
02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:29.010
<v Speaker 7>can I help you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm like,</v>

3336
02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.540
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what road is this out here?</v>

3337
02:12:30.541 --> 02:12:31.141
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mind you,</v>

3338
02:12:31.141 --> 02:12:32.610
<v Speaker 7>it's the road I live off of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3339
02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.840
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what road is this out here?</v>

3340
02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:35.640
<v Speaker 7>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we're like,</v>

3341
02:12:35.641 --> 02:12:36.540
<v Speaker 7>oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

3342
02:12:36.541 --> 02:12:37.271
<v Speaker 7>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

3343
02:12:37.271 --> 02:12:38.060
<v Speaker 7>And so we,</v>

3344
02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:39.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the car and the cops gone.</v>

3345
02:12:39.781 --> 02:12:42.900
<v Speaker 2>So we back out and head back down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road again,</v>

3346
02:12:43.590 --> 02:12:45.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to get further away from the Stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light.</v>

3347
02:12:45.811 --> 02:12:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Make a left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look over in the parking lot across</v>

3348
02:12:48.421 --> 02:12:51.740
<v Speaker 2>the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grade school parking lot cops</v>

3349
02:12:51.741 --> 02:12:53.970
<v Speaker 2>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I make the first right,</v>

3350
02:12:53.971 --> 02:12:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I can then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I turned right into a neighborhood</v>

3351
02:12:56.761 --> 02:13:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and I'm driving along and he finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>catches me and I think I cried.</v>

3352
02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Helped me.</v>

3353
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Did he turn his lights on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were running from him?</v>

3354
02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Kind of [inaudible] this guy sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shitty driver,</v>

3355
02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:09.460
<v Speaker 3>like a shitty cop,</v>

3356
02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think I got in trouble for being</v>
