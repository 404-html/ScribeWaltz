00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.850
<v Speaker 1>William James was one of the,</v>

5
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys who really did a good job of that saying basically,</v>

6
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>if I may be right about this way of thinking,</v>

8
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but even if I'm not thinking this way allows me to lead a better life.</v>

9
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think he was talking about free will and he was basically saying,</v>

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

11
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we have freewill or I don't know if everything we do is based on</v>

12
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>a causal chain of events that we really can't control.</v>

13
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>But thinking about free will in a way that it does exist allows me to live a</v>

14
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>better life.</v>

15
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And so guess what,</v>

16
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I am a proponent of freewill because that allows me to live a better life that</v>

17
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:42.381
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

18
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Cause I feel like I have more flexibility,</v>

19
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.111
<v Speaker 1>more choice.</v>

20
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a happier person.</v>

21
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think sometimes people forget some of that too.</v>

22
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

23
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's something to be said for thinking about things.</v>

24
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know,</v>

25
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>think about things in a,</v>

27
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's going to allow you to lead the best life.</v>

28
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

29
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>way better than if you don't know any ways you think about something in a way</v>

30
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>that fucking sucks.</v>

31
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

32
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to hell for sure.</v>

34
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're wrong in that you've lived a life being afraid and being worried about</v>

36
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

37
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

38
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you were wrong.</v>

39
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Might as well think in a positive way.</v>

40
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.171
<v Speaker 1>And it's still,</v>

41
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you still may turn out to be wrong,</v>

42
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

43
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Speaker 1>along the way you lived in a better way.</v>

44
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like someone is starting a cult.</v>

46
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.973
<v Speaker 1>That's what I just heard.</v>

47
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.963
<v Speaker 1>I heard it.</v>

48
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

50
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>no doubt man.</v>

51
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>

52
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's couldn't,</v>

53
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it might not be either or as well.</v>

54
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It might be another one of those situations.</v>

55
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.081
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

58
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.483
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

60
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

61
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of things going on.</v>

62
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things going on in this life and um,</v>

63
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I think we should acknowledge all of them.</v>

64
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Speaker 1>we should acknowledge the most importantly,</v>

66
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>the mystery of it all.</v>

67
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the big things that drives me crazy about someone when they say,</v>

68
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you know that this is this and that is that in the,</v>

69
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>the way you should live is this,</v>

71
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.080
<v Speaker 1>and the way the government should do is that,</v>

72
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>and the way we're going to solve this is by that.</v>

73
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe not,</v>

74
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe not like are you,</v>

75
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>are you really so sure that you're paying attention to what the fuck is going</v>

76
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

77
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>We're flying through space like we're on a spaceship.</v>

78
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Spaceship was a hundred feet wide.</v>

79
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>You'd be freaking the fuck out right now.</v>

80
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why you're not freaking out,</v>

81
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's like thousands of miles wide,</v>

82
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a space ship.</v>

83
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>You're on this spinning fucking thing.</v>

84
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And at nighttime you could see the space you're flying through and you spinning</v>

85
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 1>a thousand miles an hour in a circle and your hose floating around this giant</v>

86
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>nuclear explosion.</v>

87
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's around other bigger rocks that are flying behind you and gas giants.</v>

88
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:34.481
<v Speaker 1>And then other galaxies and other universe has an on and on and on and you just</v>

89
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>hurdling through it while you're worried about what's on TV and why the walking</v>

90
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>dead is so many commercials and why gas is $4.</v>

91
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you imagine,</v>

92
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 1>if this was,</v>

93
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.493
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

94
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.240
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in a position where this really was a dream and you had a lucid</v>

95
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>dream where you're aware,</v>

96
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>is that what you would want to do with your dream?</v>

97
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to sleep at night and you were saying you would worry about all</v>

98
00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:57.490
<v Speaker 1>of these inane things,</v>

99
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>never actually be in the present,</v>

100
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>never taken adventure,</v>

101
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>never go on a risk,</v>

102
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>never love because you could get hurt.</v>

103
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.331
<v Speaker 1>Now if you,</v>

104
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

105
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>if you really did treat this like a dream,</v>

106
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>you would do as much cool shit as possible.</v>

107
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.571
<v Speaker 1>put his,</v>

109
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>put as many good things into that dream as he possibly could and not not be so</v>

110
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>fucking stressed out about all this nonsense.</v>

111
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:18.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:18.831
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

113
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've been talking a lot,</v>

114
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda been the theme of this podcast,</v>

115
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually did,</v>

116
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>if this was a lucid dream,</v>

117
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you know you would live it in a different way.</v>

118
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You would live it to have some fun and enjoy it.</v>

119
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Like what can I fly cause all my lucid dreams I want to fly or breathe</v>

120
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>

121
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Breathing underwater is cool too.</v>

122
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.443
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

123
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>it would be very strange if one day it was,</v>

125
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it was proven that we are really living in some sort of self created reality.</v>

126
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a really traumatizing for a lot of people that have fucked it</v>

127
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

128
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.461
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

129
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>this is what I made.</v>

130
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>But it's like remember when you were in school and like there was a project and</v>

131
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you had to use your hand and make a Turkey and you put your hand down.</v>

132
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>He drew around and then you know,</v>

133
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got their own little Turkey painted it and then the teacher would</v>

134
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>put them up with new and I'll look at them.</v>

135
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.481
<v Speaker 1>Some people's,</v>

136
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's looked like dog shit.</v>

137
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>I looked,</v>

138
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck a Turkey looked like.</v>

139
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know how to draw around their hand.</v>

140
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Like everything was a disaster and other people that beautiful darkies well your</v>

141
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>life is a work of art.</v>

142
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Your life is like a hand Turkey that you make in grade school.</v>

143
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
