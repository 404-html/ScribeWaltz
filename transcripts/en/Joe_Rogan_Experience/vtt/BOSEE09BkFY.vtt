WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
Do too.

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 1>And we're live.</v>

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.053
We're live with the chat.

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.941
We're live.

5
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.051
Well,

6
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:09.884
the out of the chair.

7
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.521
What's up man?

8
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.940
How are you look better than anybody I've ever seen.

9
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:15.440
Just a couple of weeks out of shoulder surgery.

10
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.280
I'm a savage man.

11
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.140
You're walking around like there's nothing going on.

12
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.310
They took my savvy stem cells out of my own damn back and he threw him in my

13
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:23.600
shoulder out of your back.

14
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.421
The hipbone writer.

15
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.000
Fuck bone marrow.

16
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.900
They got in there.

17
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.580
Cintrifuse spun him,

18
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.040
shot him into my shoulder and shit.

19
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.960
I should have a lingo,

20
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.110
but I'm out Tuesday anyway,

21
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:36.380
so I kind of prematurely decided to come out of the slain.

22
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.861
Oh,

23
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:39.020
so he's supposed to be able to sling and six days.

24
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.730
Yeah,

25
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.950
no,

26
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.400
no.

27
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.240
Is that six days?

28
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.890
Whatever.

29
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.723
Tuesdays.

30
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.383
Yeah.

31
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.573
Wow.

32
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.070
So my guy is really a grad,

33
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.300
so I went to Dr. Andrews.

34
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.990
He's out there and I'm in Pensacola and he said,

35
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:51.201
no,

36
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.700
we need you back punching in two months.

37
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.030
So the day after surgery,

38
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.430
heart surgery,

39
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.470
he said making contact.

40
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.550
So two months.

41
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.350
I mean right after surgery I was doing two a days fucking full last rehab.

42
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.070
Really?

43
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.430
Yeah,

44
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.263
like crazy.

45
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.811
So I'm like,

46
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.710
these dudes is nuts.

47
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.490
This shoulder.

48
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.210
I had this done in Oh eight I didn't move for like three weeks.

49
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.440
What'd you have done with that one?

50
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.440
Anything Labor now you,

51
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.980
you hurting this and training.

52
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.480
Are you hurting it in fights?

53
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.141
Um,

54
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.730
a lot of people don't know about me.

55
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.350
They think I just throw my right hand a lot,

56
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
but I wasn't never really confident with my left hand because I had that left

57
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:25.424
leg room tear.

58
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.450
So it felt weird to throw hooks and it felt weird to use my jab a lot,

59
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:30.590
my shoulder fatigue a lot.

60
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.510
So I didn't tell a lot of people that.

61
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.560
So I just started bombing,

62
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.500
bombing like hell with my right hand.

63
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.630
It wasn't because I was just her writing in heavy.

64
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.720
So now that I had the surgery on this one,

65
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.160
I'm one of the stem cell bolt.

66
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.560
Shoulders rehabbed the crap out of it.

67
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.470
And also about this on the Rehab machine called an art wave.

68
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.311
You ever heard of it?

69
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:49.031
Like a Russian.

70
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:50.290
Stan is like nuts.

71
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.681
No.

72
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:51.220
What is it?

73
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.240
It's like a Russian stim machine that has the ability to make your muscles

74
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:59.890
contract 500 times a second at its highest setting.

75
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.030
So a lot of people use it.

76
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:01.811
A coach use it.

77
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:03.100
A lot of pro athletes use it.

78
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.170
The people that made it in Minnesota,

79
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:08.080
they don't give a lot of information because they don't want to answer.

80
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.280
That's real property stolen,

81
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.010
but they charge you like 12 to 14 grand for the machine.

82
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.500
Then they charge you five grand and show you how to use it.

83
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.341
Then if you really,

84
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:16.270
really want to know how to use it,

85
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:18.850
they charge you as another 500 I mean five grand.

86
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.440
So I was lucky enough,

87
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.820
I hope they ain't watching that shit.

88
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.800
I was lucky enough to get one from my homie,

89
00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:24.311
Mark Clayton.

90
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.480
They used to play with the rams.

91
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.890
I just bought his from him.

92
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.030
And so what did,

93
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.960
what is it called again?

94
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.370
It's called an arp wave.

95
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.210
Art Wave.

96
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.170
Aarp arp.

97
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.850
ARP,

98
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.510
which stands for advanced program?

99
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.270
Yeah,

100
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.600
while dance recovery program.

101
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:39.790
So basically if you think about scar tissue,

102
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:40.624
soft tissue,

103
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.831
it has ability.

104
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:44.020
It's not like that stem that feels like the needle poke in,

105
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.270
but it's like intense stem that goes through.

106
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.760
It can break their fucking scar tissue or um,

107
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.100
go to soft tissue and basically increased blood flow,

108
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.000
range of motion.

109
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.800
So sprang ankles,

110
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.131
you know,

111
00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:54.911
in one session.

112
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:55.660
That should be,

113
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.740
he'll real.

114
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.573
Yeah,

115
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.470
I've used it hundreds and hundreds the time.

116
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.660
I just didn't have the money to buy it until recently.

117
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.703
Wow.

118
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.790
They use it to since college.

119
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.650
And so now you put this on your shoulder and what will you put it on your

120
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.071
shoulder?

121
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.180
An ad like this posture.

122
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.800
So you hold this posture just position.

123
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.430
Right.

124
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.790
Um,

125
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
and then they also do a balance as first because if your back is fucked up,

126
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.800
you need and your balance is off,

127
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.560
then neurologically it's not going to actually sin.

128
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.410
Um,

129
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.641
the,

130
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.960
the current to the right spot.

131
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.740
So they,

132
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.230
maybe she'll Laura back and your shoes are fucked up,

133
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.340
so now your shoes are messed up.

134
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.101
So make it a lower back.

135
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:28.460
Her,

136
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.440
you know how to balance test,

137
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.180
right?

138
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.880
So they do that first adjust.

139
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.460
You make sure you all balanced out.

140
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:35.770
Then they find what they call a hotspot.

141
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.570
So he put at a neutral site,

142
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.710
the black pad,

143
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.300
which is like your lower back or something.

144
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.950
Then wherever you're feeling the pain,

145
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.630
if I'm feeling it right here,

146
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.980
the pain might not be covered from there.

147
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.580
So they might,

148
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.160
they searched around and who does she jump out?

149
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.930
So now this becomes a hotspot.

150
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.930
So now I take the other pat off and find a spot.

151
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.341
Then when they,

152
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:54.140
those who connect,

153
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.030
you feel like you're about to die.

154
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.690
Then they wrap you up and then they do seven minutes on reverse,

155
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.280
seven minutes on positive,

156
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.360
and then it's,

157
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.410
it's painful as shit.

158
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.440
But like I've done training calves has some severe injuries and nobody would

159
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:08.380
ever,

160
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.700
ever no real.

161
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.940
Yeah,

162
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.773
it's crazy.

163
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.940
So like,

164
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.120
<v 2>so you saying that like if you have something that's bothering you,</v>

165
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.750
a lot of times there's something is wrong somewhere else that's causing that to

166
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:21.510
be bothering you and this somehow or another finds that

167
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.180
<v 1>you,</v>

168
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.871
you balance,

169
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.080
you do a valid test first.

170
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:25.930
So say like a chiropractor comes in and he say,

171
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.051
Oh,

172
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:27.400
you hips off your legs longer.

173
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.211
He just,

174
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:28.390
you,

175
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.310
you have to be adjusted and balanced first.

176
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.950
Then they put the pads on it and you locate what?

177
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:33.820
They caught a hotspot.

178
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.290
So say my shoulder,

179
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.100
right.

180
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.640
For some reason I broke my wrist a long time ago,

181
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.320
so I can't do like that.

182
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.120
So it can push down on things.

183
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.890
So you see how I can't get my hand to bed.

184
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.460
Oh,

185
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.820
so if you get down to push up top,

186
00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:49.320
I'm going to like this because my wrist is in the best.

187
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.990
Yeah.

188
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.280
So when I'm throwing a punch,

189
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.440
especially if I'm telling you it's a crazy as punch,

190
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.920
you can imagine that if I don't distribute the force properly,

191
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.070
they shits.

192
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.230
My form's gonna be sore.

193
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.510
Probably what's caused my shoulder pain.

194
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.800
Also being extended position and wrestling extended stretched out over time and

195
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.460
time.

196
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.360
It caused a shock.

197
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.000
Now just that one punch I hit Damien Maia with,

198
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.380
maybe that wasn't a punch.

199
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.960
They might've been the last straw that broke the camel's back.

200
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.580
But I think wearing in from all those different years just beat my showed up.

201
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.240
So you all said,

202
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.220
what's this guy doing here?

203
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.560
Foreign and after best kind of version.

204
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.090
I think I got kind of a good video.

205
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.481
Yeah.

206
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:29.590
Ran Range of emotion wise is is is actually deceiving because sometimes you'll

207
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.230
fucking get zapped on this deal and you couldn't bring your arm up at all and

208
00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:34.270
then all of a sudden now you're like,

209
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:35.560
oh shit I'm hill.

210
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.090
But you're not really heal.

211
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.860
You got to continue to do the protocol,

212
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:41.590
continued to do the treatment and work on range of motion.

213
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.510
If you can do it one time you feel great.

214
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.220
Go out there and started shooting threes.

215
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.810
You're shit got me fucked up.

216
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.820
Yeah.

217
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.820
So so in the Damien Maia fight you hurt your shoulder like with one of the first

218
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:54.131
punches you through,

219
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:55.000
right guys?

220
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.661
I was,

221
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:58.340
I knew it happened because I knew it.

222
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.160
I knew it's what they call sub plex or dislocate or whatever.

223
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.940
So I do,

224
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.150
I saw an opening had already launched his eye up and my arms trying to fuck

225
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.450
that.

226
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.500
The side of his face up.

227
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.410
So I saw as I'm left eyeball already,

228
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.250
almost close.

229
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.960
So I say I finished had to go ham on bow,

230
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.890
I'll do the punch and I felt my shoulders go down and I'm like,

231
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.490
Oh shit.

232
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.323
So then I was like,

233
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.940
I can't lose a fight again at to do take my bill.

234
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.260
So at this point I said,

235
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.290
I'm going to throw straight punches and reaction and I see my power punch,

236
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:27.554
I'm a throw it.

237
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.010
So a couple times I forgot and I threw it and Kinda went out again and he took

238
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.140
some shots and I lift him up and they kind of went out again.

239
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.760
So three or four times in a fight,

240
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:35.261
I can feel it.

241
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.540
You just go like go like a whole like five or six light bulbs,

242
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.141
just crushing me,

243
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.940
your shoulder,

244
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.773
you kind of feeling going.

245
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.660
But I had that pain before and I'm,

246
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.150
and I'm,

247
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.080
I mean it sounds stupid.

248
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.720
I'm blessed that I tore this one because I knew what it felt like.

249
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.320
And I know that the only pain that I'm in the fields when I extend,

250
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.980
when I tried to go that direction or any overhead,

251
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:55.341
right.

252
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.450
That shit was going to be a rap.

253
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.770
So when I stayed here I just do straight punches and there's a couple of times I

254
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:04.220
blitz it forward and I wanted to punch and I didn't punch because I didn't feel

255
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.870
confident when my hand.

256
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.130
Hmm.

257
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.790
So you,

258
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.710
you kind of,

259
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:09.980
you knew something was wrong.

260
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:11.360
They just didn't know exactly what it was.

261
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.691
I knew,

262
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.141
I knew,

263
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.190
I knew it's sub plex,

264
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:16.100
so I knew a dislocated for sure whether the ligament was torn,

265
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.371
not,

266
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:17.450
I was praying that it wasn't,

267
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.950
cause you can actually do that,

268
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.840
slip it out without a tiering.

269
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.010
But most times when you do that as a result of these muscles fatigue and you

270
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:29.210
punch into hard making contact with your target and then your whole muscle,

271
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.920
you just go,

272
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.640
you just kinda feel like the best way I can explain it,

273
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.900
everything's just kind of fell down.

274
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.010
So you tried to rehab it for a while,

275
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.900
tried to,

276
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.740
what did you try to do?

277
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.371
May I did,

278
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:38.420
I did the arb treatment.

279
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.840
Um,

280
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.520
I did regular physical therapy.

281
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.270
Um,

282
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.710
I mean you got an MRI,

283
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.281
Mri.

284
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.090
I got two Mris.

285
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.440
I had one doctor telling me that,

286
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:45.951
you know,

287
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:46.880
I didn't have to do it.

288
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.820
I could one doctor can care less.

289
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.480
Um,

290
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.800
and then finally I went to Dr. Andrews and he was like,

291
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.634
you know what,

292
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.290
how long do you plan on fighting for?

293
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.010
And a,

294
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.930
and I hate when people ask me this because I'm fine.

295
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.591
I'm like,

296
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.910
Shit until I get tired of fighting.

297
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.841
And he was like,

298
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:00.111
well,

299
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:02.870
if you think you're going to be done fighting then don't get it done.

300
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.960
But if you want to have a career and you want to be able to constantly punch,

301
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.411
he said,

302
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.191
I watch your video.

303
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:07.910
He said,

304
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.230
you make your money with your right hand.

305
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.561
He said,

306
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:11.780
if you want to go out there and punch and be confident,

307
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.970
let me go in there and then be cleaned it out.

308
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:14.930
Let me anchor down.

309
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.510
Um,

310
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.770
we will shoot some stem cells and PRP in there on the way out of the surgery.

311
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.310
Um,

312
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.800
we'd be aggressive and make sure you get that range of motion and um,

313
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.880
you'll be back in there punching.

314
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:27.881
So I decided that my ass for four times for world title fights in a year,

315
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.910
if anybody deserved to touch up something they heard in the fight,

316
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:32.241
just me.

317
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:32.870
So,

318
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.210
uh,

319
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.490
I decided to go with it.

320
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:34.671
I'm,

321
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:35.870
I was so close man.

322
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:37.400
Even all the way up until the day of surgery,

323
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.181
I was like,

324
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:38.361
man,

325
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:39.350
I don't want to fucking do this.

326
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.510
I don't want to do this and I just don't want to be doing surgery now.

327
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.710
We you still training?

328
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.000
We're still throwing punches.

329
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:44.360
Yeah,

330
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.110
I was trying to do.

331
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.760
And what did it feel like when you're throwing punches?

332
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.633
Um,

333
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.830
I mean that's the reason why I got it.

334
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.580
I mean uppercuts straight punches along that if I throw a straight punch and I

335
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.450
didn't turn my body over and I was just on punching,

336
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.513
she ever,

337
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.000
the uppercut didn't hurt.

338
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.330
Uh,

339
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.970
I was shadowboxing hidden paths hitting the bag.

340
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.860
If I throw it overhand right.

341
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.540
It was not feeling,

342
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.440
it was not going to happen.

343
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.350
So shoulders is such a weird joint,

344
00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:06.580
you know,

345
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.710
there's so much motion.

346
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.581
Even now,

347
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.990
like you're doing a rehab now,

348
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.920
like part of my protocols with dumbbells,

349
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.600
I can,

350
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.710
I can slay a,

351
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.060
but if I come out here,

352
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.000
I mean you can just see if you see the way my body's starting to get alarmed,

353
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.770
I don't feel comfortable yet.

354
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.551
But you're only,

355
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:21.960
how many days out of surgery?

356
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.620
Two weeks.

357
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.680
Two weeks is nothing amazing that you can move.

358
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.161
I'll be back.

359
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.350
I'll be back training a couple of months.

360
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.770
Wow.

361
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:30.030
Yeah.

362
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.281
Well what?

363
00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:34.830
This art machine and then with stem cells and PRP,

364
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:39.690
it's like the world's a different place now for engine had this shit in 2008 so

365
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:40.141
I'd tell you,

366
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:41.160
and I rehabbed myself.

367
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.551
I took,

368
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.200
so our rehab book,

369
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.980
I had all these protocols from the sports medicine people that gave me and I put

370
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:50.610
my own shit together and I made my own workout and I did it religiously,

371
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.444
twice a day.

372
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.530
But it's not the same as somebody stretching you every single degrees,

373
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:56.281
every direction,

374
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.270
every plane watching your growth and actually being a specialist.

375
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.150
I was just doing shit cause I didn't want my shoulder messed up and I just

376
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:03.984
started fighting.

377
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.870
Like when I first started I was a wrestling coach for Tlo,

378
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:07.704
Alvarez.

379
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.430
Either words,

380
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.300
Dean Thomas.

381
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.540
I wasn't really a fight or Friday I had a couple of amateur fights,

382
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:14.040
but I didn't know if I wanted to do this shit or not.

383
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.910
Then I had to have a shoulder surgeon.

384
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:17.161
I'm like,

385
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:17.994
damn man,

386
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.100
I don't know how the hell I'm gonna pay for this.

387
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.780
So a guy named Wade Rome,

388
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:23.010
he was American top team guy.

389
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.780
I didn't know what the fucking American top team was.

390
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.940
He brought the satellite school,

391
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.540
the University of Missouri where I was coaching at.

392
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.050
He came into the gym and he wanted to pay for our weight room,

393
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.980
a wrestling team.

394
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.821
And I'm like,

395
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:33.211
well shit,

396
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:34.590
let me go in there and train to his gym.

397
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.830
And I wasn't trained his jam and I worked for him for time so I can get

398
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.800
insurance so I can get the shoulder surgery and um,

399
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.190
shit.

400
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.180
After that I said,

401
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:43.550
let me get this fight and take a shower.

402
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.021
I wasn't even,

403
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:46.351
I was,

404
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:46.601
I didn't,

405
00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:48.750
I was just doing it just to see what it was like.

406
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.090
But that's crazy.

407
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:51.690
Yeah,

408
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.201
that's crazy.

409
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.970
When you think about how successful you've been at it,

410
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.620
and I had a lot of chances to quit too.

411
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.180
Broke in debt,

412
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.620
50 grand in debt.

413
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.340
And I'm like,

414
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.061
I told my coach,

415
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:00.241
I said,

416
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:00.900
I can't do this shit.

417
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.580
And when I said I'm a fulltime coach,

418
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.690
um,

419
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.020
I'm going negative day 15 out of 30 days,

420
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:07.771
man,

421
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:08.730
I can't even afford the,

422
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:09.331
that's when gas,

423
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:10.530
remember if gas first hit,

424
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.910
I was getting 99 thing gas and all of a sudden wants to three bucks at the

425
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:16.050
broker's point of my life.

426
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.670
I was like hell with that.

427
00:11:17.671 --> 00:11:19.410
So I did that.

428
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:19.891
And he said,

429
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:20.724
you know what?

430
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.290
You got a future in this man.

431
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:23.124
He said,

432
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.330
take out a student loan.

433
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.710
I was in graduate school.

434
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.340
He said,

435
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.151
take out a student loan.

436
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:30.740
So I took out a student loan and graduate school to fund my MMA training.

437
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.980
Wow.

438
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.510
And I didn't even finish graduate school.

439
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.191
Wow.

440
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.060
That's crazy.

441
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:36.960
Yeah,

442
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.501
that's crazy.

443
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:38.820
Isn't it all worked out the way it did.

444
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.510
It worked out.

445
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.890
I would complain about it Dan and tried to pay me 50 grand,

446
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:48.990
less known being 50 grand in debt.

447
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.650
You know,

448
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.750
it's like tables have turn quite a bit.

449
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.171
Yeah,

450
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.320
it's fascinating isn't it?

451
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.131
When you look back,

452
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:55.570
if you look back 10 years ago,

453
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.401
10 years ago,

454
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:57.611
God,

455
00:11:57.611 --> 00:11:58.960
I can't believe I've been fighting for,

456
00:11:58.961 --> 00:11:59.351
what is it,

457
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.400
1213 years now?

458
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.470
2005 was my first fight.

459
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.483
Wow.

460
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.003
Nuts.

461
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.550
Now your world champ.

462
00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:09.700
So with this uh,

463
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.900
rehabilitation,

464
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.780
they said there they'd like you to throw punches inside of two months.

465
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.350
Yeah.

466
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.050
And then when would you be able to like fully resume training?

467
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.280
They think three of us.

468
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.113
They think three months.

469
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.290
I mean granted with this surgery you can hear someone say four months,

470
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.101
you can hit six months.

471
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.300
Some people take a full year.

472
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.770
It depends on who the surgeon is,

473
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:28.330
how aggressively they push you for.

474
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.190
It depends on why you need to get back.

475
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.700
I got a belt to defend and I got money to make and I got people asking me,

476
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:34.690
so I got to get back.

477
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.040
So with that said,

478
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm going,

479
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.760
I called the UFC,

480
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.350
I'm like,

481
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.220
this is bullshit.

482
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.230
I'm you're world champion.

483
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.310
I need one.

484
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:44.680
Am I going to do with three days a week and I'm not a senior citizen.

485
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.740
I need physical therapy approved for five days a week.

486
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.690
I need this game ready ice machine.

487
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.640
I need to do PRP in six weeks.

488
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.140
They should want me to get back.

489
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.010
And you know,

490
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.843
um,

491
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:55.660
they,

492
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:55.930
they,

493
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.920
they listened to me and say,

494
00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:57.341
you know what?

495
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:57.910
He's right.

496
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.211
You know,

497
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.690
give them whatever you want to give him so he can get back and get her and

498
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.280
fighting because I was fighting extremely often for them.

499
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.030
Now you,

500
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.790
you're living in St Louis?

501
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.001
Yeah,

502
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:07.321
I live,

503
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:08.650
I've got a house in Saint Louis.

504
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.000
I'm out here every week though.

505
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.560
I'm doing Fox TMZ.

506
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.680
I didn't know you were doing that many different TV things.

507
00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:15.670
So what are you doing on Fox?

508
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.091
I do.

509
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.080
I'm doing UFC tonight.

510
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.150
DC's out and trying to count.

511
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:19.961
So anytime DC,

512
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:20.890
Brisbane or whatever,

513
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.931
I'm usually got,

514
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:24.310
it fills in where you'll see it tonight and you have to come out here and do

515
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:25.144
that every week.

516
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.680
Wow.

517
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.461
They don't watch him say,

518
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:28.960
Hey bids me you,

519
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.711
you are in DC.

520
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:30.131
Don't watch.

521
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:30.980
I said I'm a snag.

522
00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:31.840
Get Damn job.

523
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.580
I'm be a permanent out here.

524
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.440
Cause I had a good show yesterday.

525
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.910
I didn't want to watch out.

526
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.863
Do you like doing that?

527
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.980
I loved doing it.

528
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.120
I love getting out of the box.

529
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:40.541
That's why,

530
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:40.841
you know,

531
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.070
I know he probably gonna get it until later.

532
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.900
That's why I did stand up comedy the other day.

533
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.280
I did stand up comedy.

534
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.820
I heard about the Adam Hunter had you up at the Dharma and wants to diamond bar

535
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.040
because I feel like acting is what I'm going to do after I get in a fight and,

536
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.900
and if you can be okay with being embarrassed,

537
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.270
not being uncomfortable and really not giving a fuck,

538
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.040
then you can become a great actor if you have the gift and you're willing to put

539
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:03.401
in the work.

540
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:04.600
So I've always put in the work.

541
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:05.560
I'm not worried about that.

542
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.000
But if I've got to cry,

543
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.470
I got to be a college douche bag.

544
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:11.140
I it to be something that I'm not used to being.

545
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.310
I can be a tough guy all day.

546
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.140
I can be a secret agent,

547
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.531
you know?

548
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:14.741
I mean,

549
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:15.670
you're gonna film this,

550
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.600
you know,

551
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.880
we can watch a film and Mimic it,

552
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.301
you know,

553
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:20.650
for ice and mimic Friday.

554
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.030
You cannot tell me I wasn't smoky,

555
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.710
I was sounds just like Chris Ducker.

556
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:25.330
Like I was really in the fucking movie,

557
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.230
but he didn't have anybody to look at.

558
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.460
He had a fucking script and he had to bring that to life.

559
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.181
And you know,

560
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:35.020
we really critical and actors and I just don't want to be the weakest link,

561
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:35.741
everyone in the film.

562
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.340
So.

563
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.220
So that's what you want to do when you're done with all that?

564
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.591
For sure.

565
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:39.424
For sure.

566
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.420
It that always been an aspiration or is it something you saw as like a way to do

567
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:45.070
it after it's over a lot of stuff,

568
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:45.550
you know,

569
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.780
I don't really even like fighting to real honest.

570
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.031
Yeah,

571
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:49.870
I'm just good at it.

572
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.320
What don't you like about it?

573
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.030
I don't like the politics behind it.

574
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:53.631
I don't like to,

575
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.030
a martial art aspects has been taken away from it.

576
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.080
I don't like to um,

577
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.520
disrespect to the sport.

578
00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.150
Um,

579
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.841
guys that are,

580
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:00.260
you're not,

581
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.430
not really training hard.

582
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.090
Um,

583
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.730
it don't look the part I think professional athletes you look a certain way.

584
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.570
Um,

585
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.090
I really just don't like the youth.

586
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.730
This generation of fighters that watching move on TV on youtube and they go in,

587
00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:13.564
they tried to do it.

588
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.140
They don't want to drill repetitions,

589
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.350
lead.

590
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.670
I don't want to actually put in the work.

591
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.430
Um,

592
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.770
why does that affect you though?

593
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.880
It affects me because our sport is also the fans and the fans actually culture

594
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:26.540
who gets to fight and if a guy's going to talk enough shit and so I went and

595
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:31.250
flight suits then this day and age that's good enough for a title shot and I

596
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:34.190
think it's disrespectful to everybody that came before that.

597
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.870
Remember that you had to go 10 to know.

598
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.760
Then you get the fucking call from the UFC,

599
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.190
give kind of one RM,

600
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.300
low ball fun in the UFC and a 500 record he's going to be in the UFC.

601
00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.134
And I just,

602
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.400
it's,

603
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.680
it's ways that the sport is taken a love out of it.

604
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.220
But I just find a way in dominated my opponents,

605
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.020
taking all the tools away from them.

606
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.771
You know,

607
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:59.200
Dean Tom and shout out to them and Duke Roufus are fucking masterminds.

608
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.310
So I take pride in that,

609
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.180
take pride and go in and they're not getting hit dominated,

610
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.110
knocking people out,

611
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:06.580
whatever I got.

612
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.870
<v 2>When you say you don't like fighting,</v>

613
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:10.480
you'd like all those things you don't like to what other people are doing?

614
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.920
<v 1>I love training.</v>

615
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.580
I don't like what I don't like to,

616
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:14.800
we'll split the spores become,

617
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.060
<v 2>so this is an interesting thing to talk about because a lot of people have</v>

618
00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.230
different points of view on that.

619
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:20.130
And one hand,

620
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.380
a lot of people like the traditional martial arts approach of respect for your

621
00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:29.520
opponent and just fighting to the best of your abilities and letting the chips

622
00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:30.354
fall where they may.

623
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.920
Whereas other people say,

624
00:16:31.921 --> 00:16:32.191
well,

625
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:32.730
listen,

626
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.470
to get people to show up,

627
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:35.640
to get asses in seats,

628
00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:36.930
to get paper view bys,

629
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.050
there's gotta be some drama and some entertainment value to it.

630
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:42.810
And that's where someone like Connor comes into Connor's the only one has done

631
00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:43.170
it though.

632
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.441
Yeah.

633
00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:44.550
Well Rhonda a little bit.

634
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.500
<v 1>Rhonda did it a little bit is done at the best.</v>

635
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.030
And when he actually puts in the work,

636
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.620
right,

637
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.240
he had a son before he has Sunday deal,

638
00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:51.890
but he didn't,

639
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.340
he,

640
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.290
he his mouth,

641
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.140
his mouth was louder and he's actually probably the best at it.

642
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:56.560
He's,

643
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.011
he's probably,

644
00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:57.840
he's better than Conor.

645
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.800
Edit condoms.

646
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.653
Very close.

647
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.970
But Connor actually delivers on more than more of what he said he's going to do

648
00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:04.720
it in shell dead.

649
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.171
I would agree.

650
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:08.950
So if you got to think of anybody who's brought both worlds together best,

651
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:09.850
I would have to say Connor,

652
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.590
he knocks a lot of guys out.

653
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:12.700
Try to call the round.

654
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.890
He's only lost a few fights total.

655
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.390
And even those fights,

656
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.800
it was RiskMatch war fighting the guy switched opponent this notice different

657
00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:21.700
weight class.

658
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.300
Um,

659
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:22.661
you know,

660
00:17:22.661 --> 00:17:25.120
he second those risks and rewards that if you lose,

661
00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:26.320
it's not really that big of a deal.

662
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:26.741
You know,

663
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:27.491
nobody's gonna Really,

664
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:28.480
oh my God.

665
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:29.830
Dropping down to the bottom of the pack.

666
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.390
But these other guys that haven't done it don't have the skills,

667
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.530
ain't putting in the work.

668
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.191
I mean,

669
00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:37.240
they can kind of really just,

670
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.340
<v 2>we see the trend,</v>

671
00:17:38.341 --> 00:17:38.551
right?

672
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:40.450
There is a trend right now at least though,

673
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.150
incredibly disrespectful,

674
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.470
very rude.

675
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.430
And you know,

676
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.090
you saw what happened with Colby Covington and you know,

677
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.790
at least be over doing Marangu you know what I mean?

678
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.180
<v 1>You pressing charges.</v>

679
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.493
I mean,

680
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.120
that is a queef well,

681
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:59.121
this [inaudible] there's a lot of attention being placed on him though.

682
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.201
I mean,

683
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:01.380
you,

684
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.060
you see,

685
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.390
it's nicely effective.

686
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.870
Let me see how much attention is being placed.

687
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.540
It is effective in the moment,

688
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:06.870
right?

689
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:07.080
I mean,

690
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.280
don't want to go back to this stuff.

691
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.360
It's effective in a moment.

692
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:09.991
I'm gonna tell you why.

693
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:14.550
Because sometimes there's some talking about sports is like,

694
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:14.850
you know,

695
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.630
nothing going on.

696
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.871
It was like,

697
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.740
fuck with this guy was talking,

698
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:16.921
shit,

699
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:17.610
let me listen to him.

700
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.230
Right.

701
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.160
And right there at that point Kinda was around.

702
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.053
Rhonda wasn't around.

703
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.510
I wasn't around who is UFC really projected as a star,

704
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.370
says North Korea had a few bumps,

705
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.660
Pace.

706
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.870
Van Zandt had a few bumps.

707
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.550
They tried to push up in Ghana,

708
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.500
but what started did they have?

709
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.230
So if you got this person that's willing to go crazy,

710
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.780
even though we know it's WWE,

711
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.320
the person's really not getting slammed.

712
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.480
We want to live in that moment anyway.

713
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:40.620
We want to go for the villain.

714
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.900
Who has he really beat behind Damien Maia?

715
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.070
What was,

716
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.600
what was the other top 15 victory?

717
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.531
Well,

718
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.700
the Damien Meyer was a big one,

719
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:48.600
but that was a big one.

720
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:49.380
But he was,

721
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.030
but he was unmotivated and he was a guy that already had his title shots and you

722
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:54.301
know,

723
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.350
he's getting up there in age.

724
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:56.910
What is really his motivation?

725
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.390
I wrote the book on how to beat Damien Maia and he didn't even read the book.

726
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.480
He just skim through it because no part of the book said,

727
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.300
let the Jujitsu guy fuck you up and bloody your face.

728
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.160
Colby competent did that by himself.

729
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.023
I didn't do that,

730
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.391
you know,

731
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:11.070
even with my right arm being messed up.

732
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:11.904
So,

733
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.630
um,

734
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.811
yeah,

735
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:13.261
he just,

736
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.260
I'm just looking like how many followers,

737
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.123
just

738
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.860
like he didn't have a big following before that that was his biggest fight.

739
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.670
That was the big,

740
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.360
the big coming.

741
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.320
I don't want to discredit him.

742
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:25.951
They minimize the,

743
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:26.340
Gee,

744
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.671
you know,

745
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:27.780
I don't want to discredit Colby,

746
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:29.760
but you know,

747
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.680
for you,

748
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:30.910
for,

749
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:31.680
for me,

750
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.540
have some people in your resume have some,

751
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.021
you know,

752
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:35.790
I didn't be Derrick Terex,

753
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.740
Hafeni Paul Daley,

754
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.251
Jordan,

755
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:38.371
me,

756
00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:39.810
and this is before I even got into UFC.

757
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.010
My first fight was Jay Heran who had only been stopped by George Saint Pierre

758
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.520
lost one fight to be in action that was close and had won every fight after

759
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:48.120
that.

760
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.830
So I never had an easy fight.

761
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.700
All my guys was either former champions or former contenders are former,

762
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.121
you know,

763
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:55.740
people that were interim champions.

764
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.260
And when you got a list like that and you should don't get the respect Koscheck

765
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.530
condit when he Robbie Lawler,

766
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.080
you don't get the respect from who

767
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.793
caught him.

768
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.441
Oh my God.

769
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:08.274
Can care less about

770
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.590
the respect.

771
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.530
You definitely get respect.

772
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.383
Watch this.

773
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.550
When you think of Robbie Lawler,

774
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.591
Carlos Condit,

775
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:16.920
right?

776
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.220
Right.

777
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.640
They're in a different category as it were to you that I'm the champion.

778
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:21.720
I beat both of those guys.

779
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.400
What do you mean by a different category?

780
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.670
I see them in a category then this might just be me.

781
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.320
I see them is in the category is if you're talking about guys are going to enter

782
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:32.100
the hall of fame,

783
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.933
right?

784
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.790
And you think about all Josh costs checking,

785
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.370
um,

786
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.670
oh,

787
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.010
Carlos condit and Robbie Lawler and you know this guy and Anderson Silva,

788
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.570
all those different guys.

789
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.730
But it's funny that I've defeated these guys,

790
00:20:44.731 --> 00:20:44.941
man.

791
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:45.750
You're crazy.

792
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.620
You're talking crazy.

793
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.471
I don't think so.

794
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:47.651
Yeah,

795
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:47.831
no,

796
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.220
you definitely

797
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.701
<v 2>talking crazy.</v>

798
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:50.560
You're the champ champ.

799
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:50.980
You,

800
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.700
you're acting like people don't respect you as the champ.

801
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.661
They respect.

802
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:56.494
They were sneaky.

803
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700
People think like that.

804
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.890
Carlos condit gets more respect or Robbie Lawler gets more.

805
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.900
That's crazy.

806
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.610
<v 1>Carlos condit gets more respect me.</v>

807
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:05.110
Robbie Lawler gets more respect to me.

808
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.010
But from who though?

809
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:06.730
Sure.

810
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.570
Even guys,

811
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:08.890
even guys that I defeated,

812
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:10.240
like you know,

813
00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:11.074
um,

814
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.290
Stephen Thompson tea shops and they'll get more respect to me.

815
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.190
I'm not gonna say that,

816
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.140
but people are willing to be like,

817
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.003
oh my God.

818
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:18.461
You know,

819
00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:19.510
tell them Dana said,

820
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.460
tell them to get in the cage with Tyrone Woodley.

821
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.301
He didn't say,

822
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:25.780
hey tire and tell them to get in case with Stephen Thompson on a seven fight win

823
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:26.081
streak,

824
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:30.400
knocking everybody fuck out with a really super weird style that took me months

825
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:31.300
in a fortune,

826
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.400
bringing all these fucking crazy taekwondo,

827
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.450
Raymond Daniels,

828
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.240
all these,

829
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.810
the best of the best to train him to beat him,

830
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.290
right?

831
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.210
Like nobody gave me that pass.

832
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.190
<v 2>She don't know why you concentrate on that.</v>

833
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.390
I know that seems,

834
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.950
but you are because you're talking about it.

835
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.920
I'm not concentrating on when he has these nutty thoughts.

836
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.803
I'm telling you,

837
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.983
I'm telling you,

838
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.041
I'm telling you,

839
00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:53.060
this is all nonsense.

840
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:53.894
This is a wasted,

841
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.681
wasted energy.

842
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:57.950
You think when you think about and that it doesn't matter to me because my path

843
00:21:57.951 --> 00:21:59.270
is pretty clear what I want to do.

844
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.110
I want to do the best.

845
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.800
I want to rent.

846
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.611
I want to be the best.

847
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:01.760
Well,

848
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.760
Twitter defended undisputed UFC welterweight champion in 2007 when that was the

849
00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:09.650
shit.

850
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.483
Now Shit,

851
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.410
what is in the middle of why kind of middle of last quarter and they fight and

852
00:22:15.411 --> 00:22:18.510
supervise that are bigger than a world title fight because I didn't make no,

853
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:19.700
I know you as much.

854
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.400
You don't know you as much yet and whether whatever.

855
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:22.800
Look,

856
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.660
Connor is a weird enigma and whatever reason why that got caught fire the way he

857
00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:26.841
did.

858
00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:28.790
It's a weird combination of personality,

859
00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.773
results,

860
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.670
skill.

861
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.190
It's a lot.

862
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.050
And Ireland,

863
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.620
Ireland is a big factor.

864
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.690
I mean if Conner was from Nebraska,

865
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.703
I guarantee you

866
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.280
it's not just a big fight country.

867
00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:43.820
The loyalty and the love that those people have for the people that fight from

868
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:44.654
Ireland.

869
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.530
There's not no,

870
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.640
there's nothing like that.

871
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.991
It's,

872
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:47.480
it's a,

873
00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.770
it's a weird anomaly.

874
00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:53.771
So he's just this weird aberration and he gives people almost like false hope of

875
00:22:54.171 --> 00:22:57.770
what's possible because I don't know if it's possible with a lot of people just,

876
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.820
it just,

877
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.010
it's lightening in a bottle for whatever reason.

878
00:23:01.011 --> 00:23:02.330
It worked with him,

879
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.310
but he started himself and what happened?

880
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.870
Her company jumper cables.

881
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.310
Yeah.

882
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.641
You'll see.

883
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:08.600
Put the machine behind them.

884
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:08.960
Right.

885
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.230
They definitely put them on.

886
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.660
It made sense machine behind him.

887
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.110
There was giant hordes of people flying in from Ireland.

888
00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:17.630
I remember one of some of his earlier fights I was like,

889
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.340
and I was commenting on and I was saying this is a guy who was on the undercard

890
00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.400
and they're acting like this is the main event of a paper view.

891
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:26.840
They flown from Ireland.

892
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.320
The audience is filled with thousands of people that flew from Ireland deciding

893
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.650
to bring my age and does.

894
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.731
Even back then.

895
00:23:34.731 --> 00:23:37.020
It was insane when he fell back

896
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.171
<v 1>then,</v>

897
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:37.351
you know,

898
00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:37.801
it was funny,

899
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.110
somebody when I was striking coach was like,

900
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.760
Conor Mcgregor's is huge star and da Da da Da.

901
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:43.440
I'm like,

902
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.920
that's when he had first gotten to UFC and I'm like,

903
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.410
<v 3>I don't even know who the fuck is cute is.</v>

904
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.860
He would tell he was trying to convince me,

905
00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:50.031
no,

906
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:50.811
he's a superstar.

907
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:51.091
He's Dah,

908
00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:51.241
Dah,

909
00:23:51.241 --> 00:23:51.341
Dah,

910
00:23:51.341 --> 00:23:52.040
Dah.

911
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.460
And in every time I get to share,

912
00:23:53.461 --> 00:23:54.140
as I said,

913
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.410
you,

914
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:55.243
you were right.

915
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.600
He wasn't dead,

916
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.870
but he's more of a gay ended up being a superstar and he loves to get their

917
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.960
credit because at that moment I think I was getting ready to fight dung and Kim

918
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:04.370
and he kept on with this Conor McGregor.

919
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.001
So I said,

920
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:05.441
let me look,

921
00:24:05.441 --> 00:24:05.910
this is my friend.

922
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.080
Let me look them up because you obviously got a boner for this dude.

923
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.131
And I looked him up.

924
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:10.550
I'm like,

925
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:10.911
all right,

926
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:11.510
he's good.

927
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.343
I get it,

928
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.171
but let me see him,

929
00:24:13.171 --> 00:24:16.610
be it a couple of people and then if he can be dust Emporio,

930
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.320
then I'm going to give him his props.

931
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:19.770
Knocking doctor.

932
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.351
It's important.

933
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:20.881
It doesn't pray.

934
00:24:20.881 --> 00:24:21.070
I,

935
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.903
all right,

936
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.420
well he's 100% legit.

937
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.343
He's legit.

938
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.770
It's what else is going on that's so weird.

939
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.210
It's,

940
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.660
he's not just legit.

941
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:33.230
He's also this unbelievable personality that people were drawn to him.

942
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.960
That's no one can manufacture that.

943
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.040
So like he's,

944
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:37.940
he's rehearsed it.

945
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:38.721
He's practiced that.

946
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:39.471
He's looked in the mirror,

947
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:40.730
he has natural wit.

948
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.391
He's,

949
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:43.190
he's willing to go risky.

950
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:44.480
And say some below to build shit.

951
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:45.950
And he does his research.

952
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:47.180
He don't come to a press conference,

953
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.171
just you know,

954
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:48.651
smoking.

955
00:24:48.651 --> 00:24:50.420
You'd like to front row of a comedy show,

956
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.850
he looking into some deep shit.

957
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.721
And when you get there,

958
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:54.650
you kind of stumble.

959
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.970
So you right,

960
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:56.960
he has that.

961
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.030
He also has a fight style.

962
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.510
He also has so happened to do 80% of shit he says going to do.

963
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:03.890
So now he's the fucking Messiah.

964
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.080
But you can't say that the UFC has not gotten behind you or people don't give

965
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:10.160
you the respect that you deserve.

966
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:12.220
That's why you're not in the same level as you said.

967
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.371
You said that it,

968
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:16.530
him and Connor are super fights.

969
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.530
I'm saying that he has gotten it and I was saying that he has gotten it and he

970
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.330
has lived up to what he said he's going to do.

971
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.230
And then on top of that,

972
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.300
you gotta you gotta be able to fight.

973
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.850
He can fight and he has been able to talk.

974
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:29.211
So now,

975
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:31.280
not only can he generate the pay per view,

976
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.570
buys and get people interested,

977
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.030
he's actually gonna deliver a knockout.

978
00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:35.231
Again,

979
00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:39.290
Josie auto stop as it gets Eddie Alvarez and the crazy,

980
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.860
you know,

981
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.940
back to back fights with,

982
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.540
with Nate Diaz.

983
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.820
Don't you think that you're in an unusual situation?

984
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:44.331
First of all,

985
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:48.290
because you win the title by spectacular first round knockout against Robbie

986
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.123
Lawler.

987
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.390
Unbelievable knockout.

988
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:55.630
But then you have the most awkward and difficult God to defend your title

989
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:56.810
against Wonderboy.

990
00:25:56.811 --> 00:26:01.790
Thompson is a very unusual opponent and it's hard to look good against them and

991
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:03.350
that'll all the people that fought him,

992
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.500
you're the only guy that put him in danger.

993
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:07.101
Not once,

994
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:07.934
but twice.

995
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.800
And the way you fought him.

996
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.750
I've defended the way you fought him many times.

997
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:12.051
Cause I say,

998
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:12.261
look,

999
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:14.150
if you look at tactically,

1000
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.700
if you look at technique and you look at the,

1001
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.210
the,

1002
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.650
the art of fighting,

1003
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.700
that's the way to find them.

1004
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.440
If you're a guy like Tyron Woodley,

1005
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.400
a powerful punch,

1006
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.420
it was a great wrestler.

1007
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.490
Who's got one real one punch,

1008
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:26.330
knockout ability.

1009
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.010
You're not going to open yourself up to Wonderboy.

1010
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.050
Going to rush him either.

1011
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:30.920
Exactly.

1012
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.150
Don't get picked apart.

1013
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.480
You're not going to fight him the way he wants to fight would you did as you

1014
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:38.300
laid back a lot and people booed a lot because of that.

1015
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.950
But when you connected,

1016
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.070
you are the one that heard him in those two fights.

1017
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.040
He was the one that

1018
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.530
<v 2>was in big trouble in both of those fights.</v>

1019
00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.593
<v 1>Not You.</v>

1020
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:48.920
Him with his fire was,

1021
00:26:48.921 --> 00:26:49.754
it was,

1022
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.260
it was not for me.

1023
00:26:51.261 --> 00:26:51.861
I'm never,

1024
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:52.280
um,

1025
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:52.521
you know,

1026
00:26:52.521 --> 00:26:53.930
I got the same thing in the Maya fight,

1027
00:26:53.931 --> 00:26:57.650
but at the end of the day and someone's attempted to take you down multiple

1028
00:26:57.651 --> 00:26:57.981
times,

1029
00:26:57.981 --> 00:26:59.060
over 20 times.

1030
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.010
It's very hard to get in any type of exchange.

1031
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.791
Every time you swing,

1032
00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:02.810
they want to go on and eat three shots.

1033
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.210
Maya fight was tough too,

1034
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.820
<v 2>but you got to go back and look at like Anderson Silva's dark days.</v>

1035
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:12.080
There was a dark days when Anderson Silva fought Damien Maia where nobody wants

1036
00:27:12.081 --> 00:27:13.320
to have anything to do with them after that.

1037
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:13.511
Fine.

1038
00:27:13.511 --> 00:27:13.980
Yeah.

1039
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.530
And Anderson Silva fought.

1040
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.403
Um,

1041
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.660
when he fought there,

1042
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.010
there's several fights where um,

1043
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:26.150
he had just boring results and people weren't interested in him finding anymore.

1044
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.920
One spectacular knockout and everybody's

1045
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.103
<v 1>got it all over again.</v>

1046
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.400
And then one spectacular knock out to get the belt and then everybody slowly

1047
00:27:34.401 --> 00:27:36.050
forget about it moments later.

1048
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.540
Cause at the time Stephen Thompson said,

1049
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:38.871
Nah,

1050
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:41.800
we're the fight Robbie and I think he's going to win anyway and Da da Da.

1051
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.610
And then he think I'm supposed to be just so graciously like God that's fighting

1052
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.790
honor and Nah,

1053
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.810
you wanted to fight Robbie,

1054
00:27:47.811 --> 00:27:48.644
right?

1055
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.380
You say rob,

1056
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.150
who's going to win?

1057
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.940
You say you personally prefer to write fight Robbie Cause I've been waiting

1058
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:54.410
around even though that wasn't the case.

1059
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:55.760
So you said this up.

1060
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.030
So don't think that I'm just going to give you my spotlight and say hey,

1061
00:27:59.031 --> 00:28:00.170
you know what the others do this.

1062
00:28:00.171 --> 00:28:00.890
No.

1063
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.600
If I'm seeing the table being set,

1064
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.940
I know there's Nate disease out there.

1065
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.960
Nick Diaz is out there.

1066
00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:08.960
George Saint Pierre is Michael Business guys that have that name,

1067
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.210
they have that status that I'm trying to get to.

1068
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.130
Those are the guys I want to fight.

1069
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.970
I want to knock those guys now because now I can continue to enjoy myself up

1070
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.050
fighting him.

1071
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.651
Well,

1072
00:28:18.651 --> 00:28:20.960
he's trying to get the same thing I'm trying to get,

1073
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.910
why the hell am I going to pull you up with me?

1074
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.390
Right.

1075
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.141
If that's the fight.

1076
00:28:24.141 --> 00:28:24.974
They wanted me to fight him.

1077
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.461
One of one.

1078
00:28:25.461 --> 00:28:26.600
They never offered me the fight.

1079
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:27.950
He said something.

1080
00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.770
Then I think the UFC thought I wouldn't take the fight is the first time they

1081
00:28:30.771 --> 00:28:32.090
offered me the fight accepted it.

1082
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.710
So when all these people are like,

1083
00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.550
oh my God,

1084
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.060
you don't want to fight trying to pick his fights,

1085
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.183
he's just got the belt.

1086
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.353
I'm like,

1087
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.033
Ooh man,

1088
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.451
I'm talking about,

1089
00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:44.570
it's too many people saying things that you're responding to that are,

1090
00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:46.250
that are irrelevant I think is the,

1091
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.310
the people that that are in the organization.

1092
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.641
I got to,

1093
00:28:49.641 --> 00:28:50.474
you know,

1094
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.420
you're dealing with people that I don't deal with them in that regard,

1095
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:58.190
but as far as like people that are analysts and experts as far as like the

1096
00:28:58.191 --> 00:28:58.971
social media,

1097
00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:00.740
like I really don't read social media.

1098
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.740
I post because I want to post and I leave it alone.

1099
00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:04.970
So that's why I say that.

1100
00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:07.670
I'm not saying without saying who it is.

1101
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.460
I'm not saying that the fans are making me feel some type of way cause my,

1102
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.720
my path is clear.

1103
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.430
I want to be the greatest welterweight of all time.

1104
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.240
Right?

1105
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.073
Whatever it takes.

1106
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.410
When,

1107
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.490
when I get an opportunity,

1108
00:29:16.491 --> 00:29:17.480
I'm trying to knock you out.

1109
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.230
Okay.

1110
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.063
At all times.

1111
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.800
Stephen Thompson is different types of fights as you said before.

1112
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.700
Look what happened with Robert Whitaker,

1113
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:25.350
rushed in and look what happened when this guy approached him.

1114
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:25.970
Those guys,

1115
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.201
that's,

1116
00:29:26.201 --> 00:29:30.860
people forget if you get all this shit and it also realize how tough it is to

1117
00:29:30.861 --> 00:29:32.090
take him down and gets the case.

1118
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.320
Remember how fast he pops up.

1119
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.860
So why did I get myself 31 foot that if I want to double check am I got the

1120
00:29:36.861 --> 00:29:40.310
whole place to stretch across some blast tomorrow he don't have one punch Carol

1121
00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:40.790
power.

1122
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.200
So if my back is against the octagon and when I go for a shot,

1123
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.440
I got the whole entire actually going to take them now versus pressing them

1124
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.680
gopher to take down him in the cage or both defending my shot.

1125
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.821
Then Dan him trying to,

1126
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:52.181
you know,

1127
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:53.830
do some razzle dazzle kick.

1128
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.200
So I have no issue with the way I fought him.

1129
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:56.890
Um,

1130
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:57.780
or Damien Maia,

1131
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.190
I don't think there's another way to fight them unless

1132
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.410
I did.

1133
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:02.861
He didn't,

1134
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:04.240
he didn't take Maya series.

1135
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.440
He didn't train the way.

1136
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:10.441
He didn't bring in the top Jiu Jitsu guys like with easy to spark kickbox and

1137
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:12.730
look good and never have to take a shot.

1138
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.661
The way I train,

1139
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:14.920
I put myself in positions.

1140
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.300
I know I'm never going to be in.

1141
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.650
You never going to take me down.

1142
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.820
You never go have my bag.

1143
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.200
I'm never going to be mounted.

1144
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.180
But I'm training that ship anyway.

1145
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:24.310
Just in case I slipped on a banana peel,

1146
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:25.330
I get clipped with a punch.

1147
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.770
So George Jr's,

1148
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:27.604
Mazda Dow,

1149
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.680
just from the way I watched him fight,

1150
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.820
he was surprised.

1151
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.370
Even the stuff that Stephen Thompson hit me with,

1152
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:34.480
it never surprised me.

1153
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.463
I get hit with it.

1154
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.580
He landed some good shots.

1155
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:37.720
He's really quick.

1156
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.490
I mean I'm fast and explosive,

1157
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:40.180
but he's quick.

1158
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.470
Those punches get to you fast.

1159
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.000
He's long and we started bouncing.

1160
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:45.190
You don't even know what the hell are you going to do and this kind of like what

1161
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:45.851
are you about to do?

1162
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:46.690
When do you about to do?

1163
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.110
You can watch his performance until he didn't do the proper work.

1164
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.280
Same thing with Damien Maia.

1165
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.300
He trained with Colby and like tried to take me down.

1166
00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:54.910
I'm gonna stop the shot and just knock you out.

1167
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.230
That's not how it works.

1168
00:30:56.231 --> 00:30:58.090
You've got to bring in guys and know his half guard,

1169
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.140
how he hooks her ankle,

1170
00:30:59.141 --> 00:30:59.974
Holly suites,

1171
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.960
how he switched from one side to the other.

1172
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.790
What happens when he grabbed him around your waist?

1173
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:04.630
If you give him his back,

1174
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:05.560
this is how you can lock up.

1175
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.680
I trained with guys that trained with him and the guys would have better than

1176
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.700
Damien my on the mat that way when I got out there had he taking me down,

1177
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.110
I would've been prepared to escape,

1178
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:14.920
get away,

1179
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.760
get back to my feet.

1180
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.290
Do you think that having a chip on your shoulder in some way helps you like all

1181
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.300
these people that doubt you in some way?

1182
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.650
You have to prove yourself.

1183
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.290
I just know that I'm the best.

1184
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:27.124
Like you know,

1185
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.590
me and dean was training one day and I stopped practicing.

1186
00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:30.040
I just,

1187
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.190
I had a brain fart and I started thinking about George Saint Pierre and I

1188
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:36.610
started thinking about all those skills and I start thinking about Robbie and

1189
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:37.060
all the time,

1190
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.830
well two and I said,

1191
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.240
I'm the fucking best in the world.

1192
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.890
Nobody's fastened to me.

1193
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:42.970
Nobody stronger than me.

1194
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.560
Nobody works as hard as I do.

1195
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.500
Nobody has all the skills to striking the wrestling.

1196
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:48.730
Did you just who the defense,

1197
00:31:48.731 --> 00:31:49.510
the timing,

1198
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.350
the explosion,

1199
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.221
the toughness.

1200
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:52.031
I've been in wars,

1201
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:53.020
I've been in close fights,

1202
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:53.621
I've been in fights.

1203
00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:54.454
One knock people out.

1204
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:55.751
I've been in it all.

1205
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:58.660
So when I decided that I'm the best,

1206
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.291
I saw,

1207
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:01.750
I carry myself as if I was already the champion.

1208
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.170
And that's why I had champ camp before I even had the belt.

1209
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.771
And which was,

1210
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:06.640
when was this around?

1211
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.290
Like which fight?

1212
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:07.641
Oh,

1213
00:32:07.641 --> 00:32:09.700
I'm rights Shit Robbie.

1214
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.280
Right before,

1215
00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.300
right before Robin.

1216
00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:11.590
Yeah.

1217
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.670
I was supposed to not champ camp.

1218
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:14.020
Actually we're supposed to start with um,

1219
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.071
when Johnny,

1220
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:17.260
but Johnny has some complications that make it to the scale.

1221
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.480
So they told me I was fighting Robbie.

1222
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:20.591
Yeah,

1223
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:23.740
I remember talking to you backstage one day,

1224
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.190
uh,

1225
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.550
uh,

1226
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.250
one of the wins and you were frustrated and you were like,

1227
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:29.230
when the fuck am I getting my title shot?

1228
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.093
Yeah.

1229
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.851
Well that,

1230
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.091
you know,

1231
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:31.924
that this is the thing,

1232
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.680
we know the game changes and sometimes they want to see fights play out before

1233
00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:36.810
they make a call.

1234
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.040
They never want to be an alliance and you are definitely getting a title shot.

1235
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.230
They've done it a couple of times and we've seen what happened.

1236
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:42.620
Right.

1237
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.620
And they pulled out of it.

1238
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.780
So I fought Kelvin gasoline and Kelvin gasoline was supposed to be this

1239
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:51.290
conditioning freak and he ms way by 10 pounds in,

1240
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:51.981
you know,

1241
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:52.461
for me,

1242
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:53.300
I don't play this shit.

1243
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.800
Don't act like you were so sick.

1244
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.130
No,

1245
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.090
you didn't make weight.

1246
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.950
And what happens when you don't make weight?

1247
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.340
You actually didn't have to go through in suck your body all the way down to

1248
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:01.611
scratch.

1249
00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:02.444
Wait like I did.

1250
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.980
So you should actually look better.

1251
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.180
So I don't want to be like,

1252
00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:05.570
oh,

1253
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:06.650
he was sick and that's why,

1254
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.310
you know,

1255
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.180
he had a chance.

1256
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.560
He just has never going to beat me.

1257
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.150
I fought him.

1258
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.620
He was the one that was huffing and puffing.

1259
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.311
He couldn't hit me.

1260
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:14.810
He couldn't land any significant punch.

1261
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.030
Islanded and after that fight,

1262
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.871
you know,

1263
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:18.650
um,

1264
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.630
it was some scrutiny on the fight.

1265
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:19.940
I'm like,

1266
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.773
okay,

1267
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.450
you made it grapple with him so he can try and take my back and do a redneck

1268
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.520
truck like did everybody else?

1269
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.790
You want me to exchange with him and let him get into the fight when I know I'm

1270
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:29.160
fast.

1271
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.020
I know I'm sharper.

1272
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.330
He can't hit me.

1273
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.050
I got better defense the whole time he's pushing me against the case.

1274
00:33:34.051 --> 00:33:34.820
I heard score said,

1275
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.121
no,

1276
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:35.361
no,

1277
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:35.541
no,

1278
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.051
don't go there.

1279
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:36.760
Don't go there.

1280
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.260
It was terrified that the Kaushik thing was going to happen to him,

1281
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.870
so he backed up every time he pushed me into the octagon.

1282
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.130
Why wouldn't I play on that?

1283
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.671
You know what I mean?

1284
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:45.470
So when people look at that,

1285
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:47.570
he was saying that he was going to get a title shot.

1286
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.500
I wonder if you remember that.

1287
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.780
They said if Kelvin Gasmon would be Tyree,

1288
00:33:50.781 --> 00:33:51.680
he going to get a tighter shot.

1289
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:52.750
You run.

1290
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.610
I remember people saying that.

1291
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.500
They were saying I,

1292
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.333
but they weren't saying.

1293
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.710
They didn't say that at NRB.

1294
00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.521
Dana White said,

1295
00:33:58.521 --> 00:33:59.850
if Kelvin Gasland bees,

1296
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.231
Tyron,

1297
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:01.310
he's getting a title shot.

1298
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.050
Remember he had already been coached,

1299
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.550
selected for the coach.

1300
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.600
He got the coach's job off the loss after missing weight by 10 pounds.

1301
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.940
And then they told me he would never fight it.

1302
00:34:09.941 --> 00:34:11.510
One 85 again if I took the fight.

1303
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.960
I mean one 70 again if I took the fight.

1304
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.000
So he lost me.

1305
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.010
Ms. Wade still got to Tufts coaching job and on top of that he was going to get

1306
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:23.610
a tighter shot had he beaten me.

1307
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.350
<v 2>But why do you,</v>

1308
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.310
so you again,

1309
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:26.780
it comes to this chip on your shoulder thing.

1310
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:28.400
You feel like everybody's against,

1311
00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:29.234
you know,

1312
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.073
you do a little,

1313
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:30.680
I don't want,

1314
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.490
do you want me to though?

1315
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.641
No,

1316
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:32.270
you do.

1317
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.680
This is what you're saying.

1318
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.680
It's the things that you're saying

1319
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.120
<v 1>send.</v>

1320
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.710
I'm just saying that I know.

1321
00:34:36.711 --> 00:34:37.250
I know the,

1322
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.590
I know the deck of cards I got and a lot of play.

1323
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:40.180
These technical,

1324
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.630
what do you think the deck of cards is?

1325
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.350
The deck of cards is going to come a moment where I'm a superstar and when I get

1326
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:45.831
to that moment,

1327
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:47.420
I have more leverage at this time.

1328
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:49.370
I'm not at the point where kind McGregor's at,

1329
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.330
so I got,

1330
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.920
if I got to fight the number one contender and I can't vouch Altify to George

1331
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.800
Saint Pierre or Bisbing or a con or a native at this moment,

1332
00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.520
I'm going to keep whooping ass until I get to the,

1333
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.160
<v 2>well after Georges beaten.</v>

1334
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.083
Right now.

1335
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.650
George is in an amazing position.

1336
00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:03.930
Right.

1337
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.800
George Beats Bisbing if he wanted it and he dropped the title.

1338
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:10.400
But if you wanted to come back and fight you for uh,

1339
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.630
the welterweight title,

1340
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.760
that's a legitimate super fight right there.

1341
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:15.020
I mean that makes a lot of sense.

1342
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.000
Just coming off of his big fight.

1343
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.740
You don't think he does?

1344
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.981
Look,

1345
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:19.760
did you tell me,

1346
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.230
you think judge [inaudible] your faith

1347
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.280
George had George.

1348
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:24.451
Yeah,

1349
00:35:24.451 --> 00:35:24.580
the,

1350
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.990
<v 1>she has to fight me before business.</v>

1351
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.750
He chose if I business well maybe you felt like that was a better fight for him

1352
00:35:28.751 --> 00:35:29.584
to come back with.

1353
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.050
It was a definitely a better fight cause he would have came back and gets me

1354
00:35:32.051 --> 00:35:32.884
looking like that.

1355
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.480
George would have been right back in retirement.

1356
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.860
He did not look great business and didn't all look great.

1357
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.581
Um,

1358
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:41.130
one thing that helped George Nfi his experience,

1359
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:41.850
he loosened up.

1360
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.750
He was a little uptight.

1361
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:43.540
You know,

1362
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.640
he hadn't been an octagon.

1363
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:48.720
We're four years almost a little over two or three.

1364
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:49.160
Right.

1365
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.060
It's more than that was it for,

1366
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.061
it was almost four.

1367
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:51.721
It wasn't quite far.

1368
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:52.554
It's almost for her.

1369
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.500
Cause I fall November,

1370
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.700
I found November UFC,

1371
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.140
there was a 25th anniversary.

1372
00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.470
I think it was like fuck,

1373
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.810
because fall Kasha here in the cart.

1374
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.333
Yeah.

1375
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.263
Okay.

1376
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.220
It's a long ass time for him to not fight that long chroma.

1377
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:09.570
She's trained Yo ass end in a fight.

1378
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:11.490
You don't have a train of camp focus on a person.

1379
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:12.690
It's tough.

1380
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:13.950
So when he came back,

1381
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.380
I saw the experience kit.

1382
00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:16.590
Can he relax a little bit?

1383
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.770
That's when he faked it.

1384
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.720
Lending a left hook.

1385
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.500
Heady.

1386
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.221
Not relaxed.

1387
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:20.820
I mean,

1388
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.120
you know,

1389
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.140
who knows would've happened.

1390
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:22.974
You know what I mean?

1391
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.253
Yeah.

1392
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:24.740
It was,

1393
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.200
uh,

1394
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.290
it was interesting because Bisping was tight and I expected,

1395
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:29.610
I expected him to be looser.

1396
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.950
Big Bisbing doesn't have the,

1397
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.790
the,

1398
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.810
I mean he's not guys out,

1399
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:34.710
but he's not a guy that,

1400
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:34.921
you know,

1401
00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:39.030
you're taken over like a rumble way or in cotton or myself or someone shot

1402
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.263
Stephens,

1403
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.150
Jeremy Stevens,

1404
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.500
somebody who's going to touch you in this overweight.

1405
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:44.521
So with that said,

1406
00:36:44.521 --> 00:36:44.881
he's a,

1407
00:36:44.881 --> 00:36:46.500
he's a person that's going to be volume.

1408
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.880
He's gonna be in your face.

1409
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:48.750
Great conditioning.

1410
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.830
He's very durable.

1411
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.040
And George had to make that adjustment.

1412
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:53.401
He said,

1413
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:53.910
all right,

1414
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.440
and it'd be an athlete on this guy.

1415
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.900
Then we fake him out and let me get them thinking about the shot.

1416
00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:58.681
I took him down twice.

1417
00:36:58.681 --> 00:36:59.540
Let me get them thinking about it.

1418
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.241
Level change come up,

1419
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:00.720
left foot,

1420
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.590
very smart move.

1421
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.840
And that's something that the experience of being a champion,

1422
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.033
a lot of them do.

1423
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.221
Well,

1424
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:07.020
there was some talk about him fighting Conor,

1425
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:09.060
but I didn't hear any of that from the official people.

1426
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.190
And him fighting Conor at 170 pounds would've been fascinating in terms of like,

1427
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.530
it's a terrible matchup for Connor.

1428
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.190
Yeah.

1429
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.521
You know,

1430
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:20.070
in terms of like just physicality and once again,

1431
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.030
risk and reward.

1432
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.250
What happens when you see the greatest welterweight of all time?

1433
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.430
People going to torture him about it.

1434
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:26.730
Yeah.

1435
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.800
But Canada's once that was another fight right now,

1436
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.000
like this is not a good time,

1437
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:31.110
especially in his division.

1438
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:32.910
There's so much talent right now.

1439
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.141
He want to see.

1440
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:34.980
He'll be right now.

1441
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.300
That's what I'm saying.

1442
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.253
That's what I want.

1443
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.471
I mean Tony's,

1444
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:40.920
uh,

1445
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.200
if,

1446
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.480
if I was Connor,

1447
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.373
which I'm not,

1448
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.383
um,

1449
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.380
if I had to pick the fight,

1450
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.790
they both are going to be,

1451
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.260
I mean he'll be,

1452
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.190
might be a bigger draw.

1453
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:51.660
Cause he got huge,

1454
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:51.971
huge,

1455
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:55.680
147 million people in Russia might be a bigger draw,

1456
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.620
but they both are very annoying fights,

1457
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.030
very dangerous fights.

1458
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.620
Dangerous Tony Ferguson,

1459
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.281
you know,

1460
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:04.670
it don't take much for him to find a way to get around your neck and choke.

1461
00:38:04.671 --> 00:38:05.970
And he's always get tired.

1462
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.050
He doesn't get tired.

1463
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:09.240
He looks like he's losing fights and he don't care.

1464
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:10.650
It's striking is very awkward.

1465
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.280
Um,

1466
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.740
he can really do what they did is did to Conor and Nate Diaz baffled.

1467
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.961
I'm like,

1468
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:16.171
damn,

1469
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.130
I hit you with everything.

1470
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:19.560
You still around then Kinda were for the damn shot.

1471
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.350
The same thing's gonna happen if do that to Tony.

1472
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.223
Tony's going to submit him.

1473
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.150
Here's my prediction,

1474
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.991
my prediction,

1475
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:26.310
Congress and fight for a while.

1476
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.900
He watched those two things to trip him.

1477
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.220
They strip Connor,

1478
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.163
he comes by me,

1479
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.260
Habib and Tony Fight for the world title for you.

1480
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:36.010
One of

1481
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.210
<v 2>those guys were in the car is right now,</v>

1482
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.650
but for you my dream,

1483
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.553
what's your dream?

1484
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.980
<v 1>You know what my dream was to really,</v>

1485
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.851
I wanted to,

1486
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:49.150
I wanted to find yours and as possible.

1487
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.650
I feel like if I fall George,

1488
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:52.960
I can legitimately say I'm the best welterweight of all time.

1489
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:53.800
If I beat him,

1490
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.730
it's still possible.

1491
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.110
George hasn't retired.

1492
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.180
They said anything about you.

1493
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:03.630
He asked one time on like Fox Q and a or he was gonna like so tired and if he

1494
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:04.751
fought,

1495
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:06.010
what would be your game plan?

1496
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:09.640
You know if you fought us but it got exed out because they didn't want to get

1497
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:11.080
all the fans pumped up that we were fighting.

1498
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.123
Why wouldn't they?

1499
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.420
Do you think there

1500
00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.211
<v 2>plotting against you?</v>

1501
00:39:15.211 --> 00:39:15.900
I was hearing it.

1502
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.733
Seeing your face,

1503
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:17.530
Joe.

1504
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.250
He is that going to do I am too bright.

1505
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.810
You want me to be like other people who are against me?

1506
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.390
Listen,

1507
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.180
I want you to just be focused.

1508
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.080
You want me to be real?

1509
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:30.700
Yeah,

1510
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.840
<v 1>show me real sure.</v>

1511
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.420
Do I think that the people want to see me lose?

1512
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:34.721
No,

1513
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:35.800
I don't think they want to see me a little.

1514
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:38.050
So I think that sometimes I'm a pain in the ass.

1515
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:38.320
Yeah,

1516
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.890
I am.

1517
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.330
But in business,

1518
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:42.370
at one point in any business,

1519
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:46.210
there's not the person that's doing the business now what they best interest.

1520
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.500
So if I'm an athlete and I'm looking out for my best interest and I'm trying to

1521
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:52.810
put myself in a position where you know,

1522
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.190
I can fight,

1523
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.170
become a legend and become a hall of Famer,

1524
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.060
I should do that.

1525
00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.530
If I want to be paid appropriately,

1526
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.483
I should do that.

1527
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.601
And our sport,

1528
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:03.220
because of the way the UFC started,

1529
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:04.870
we the damn UFC.

1530
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.330
You do what we say and that's it.

1531
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.260
No questions.

1532
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.400
You fight who we want to fight,

1533
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.091
you get paid.

1534
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:11.050
We want to get paid.

1535
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.063
And that's it.

1536
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.023
And then what happened?

1537
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.460
The specialist,

1538
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:15.970
the one trick ponies stop.

1539
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.200
Then collegian athletes are getting in their college wrestlers.

1540
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:20.920
No,

1541
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.010
Kenny Florian is the guy.

1542
00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:22.331
Damn.

1543
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:24.820
I'm almost thinking about being a doctor at one point.

1544
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.640
So now I got an intelligent people coming into the sport.

1545
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.470
They just so happened to be businessmen,

1546
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.430
entrepreneurs.

1547
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.650
So now I'm looking at market value.

1548
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.010
I'm seeing what these motherfuckers are making and guess what?

1549
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.260
I should be making this if they're making that,

1550
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.360
if I'm in a champion in this person's doing this,

1551
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:41.194
I should do that.

1552
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.041
No one would.

1553
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.960
Everybody's making knowing all the numbers.

1554
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.700
I want to be at least fair.

1555
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:46.840
I don't ask for no crazy.

1556
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.540
I'll ask no 15 million and all this other stuff.

1557
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.420
So if me doing that makes me come difficult,

1558
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.980
then I guess I'm just a little bit difficult.

1559
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:54.440
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1560
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:54.801
well let me,

1561
00:40:54.801 --> 00:40:56.360
let me look at it from their perspective,

1562
00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.990
what they look at in terms of what a,

1563
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.160
an athlete is worth.

1564
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.870
It's like how much are they bringing in?

1565
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.600
Like what kind of pay per view buys?

1566
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:04.941
Are you getting?

1567
00:41:04.941 --> 00:41:05.540
How much?

1568
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:05.901
How much?

1569
00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:08.000
This is what I was bringing in when the first off fighting.

1570
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.870
Well,

1571
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.340
he wasn't making nearly as much money

1572
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.020
<v 1>back then,</v>

1573
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.740
but how much was he?

1574
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.540
Everybody has to start the second way.

1575
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:14.350
You can't,

1576
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.460
you can't throw you out and say,

1577
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:15.731
okay,

1578
00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:16.740
if I wonder boy,

1579
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:17.440
um,

1580
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.610
UFC blah blah,

1581
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.390
blah.

1582
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.770
And if you don't do five,

1583
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:22.570
oh well you did 300 bucks,

1584
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.400
$300,000 you're not a draw.

1585
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.660
Okay.

1586
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.340
How was I promoted as a champion?

1587
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.260
How was,

1588
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:29.410
okay,

1589
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:33.110
<v 2>this is a long circuitous sort of a conversation if we continue along this way,</v>

1590
00:41:33.111 --> 00:41:34.540
but what I'm trying to say is

1591
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.750
there's a way where it's like a circular,

1592
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:41.300
it's sort of a thing you gonna to keep circling back around to it.

1593
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.540
What I think is there's a way for if,

1594
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.570
if you want to make a big super fight,

1595
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.250
like if George Saint Pierre really wanted to make a big super fight in the UFC,

1596
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:51.260
wanted to make a big superstar at a you,

1597
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.620
that's the fight because one of two things happens.

1598
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:56.690
Either he beats you and he's even bigger than ever,

1599
00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.600
or you beat him and you become bigger than ever.

1600
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.493
Let's do it.

1601
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.350
That's what I'm saying.

1602
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:01.881
You know the fight.

1603
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:02.480
That makes sense,

1604
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.313
but that's,

1605
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.100
that's,

1606
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.821
that makes sense.

1607
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:06.680
No one's trying to stop that from happening.

1608
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:09.620
What when the UFC is not willing to pay a certain amount of money,

1609
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.350
it's because they don't think they're going to get a certain amount of money.

1610
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.990
It's not because they're trying to avoid getting paid.

1611
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:18.710
If they thought that you could be some enormous superstar and they could make

1612
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.810
Conor McGregor type money from you,

1613
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.770
there's not,

1614
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:22.411
they would never say,

1615
00:42:22.411 --> 00:42:22.561
yeah,

1616
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:25.010
we don't want to do that cause we don't want to give Tyron power.

1617
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.070
They don't think like that.

1618
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.820
They think like they're numbers people.

1619
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:33.710
They're trying to make pay per view buys and if you only sold 300,000 paper view

1620
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:35.090
bys because the Wonderboy fight,

1621
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.980
there's not much they can do about that.

1622
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.540
I mean it's not whether or not you were promoted a certain way as a fighter is

1623
00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:44.060
like that fight for someone like me is fascinating.

1624
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.280
But for the average fucking Johnny lunchbox,

1625
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.400
I want to see blood cut type person.

1626
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.270
That's not what the pay per views a Bob pack do.

1627
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.470
Paid reviews a Bob before the fight takes place.

1628
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.191
Right.

1629
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:56.480
But they knew the style.

1630
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.321
They knew the style,

1631
00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:59.330
they knew the matchup and especially the second year

1632
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.560
<v 1>it was,</v>

1633
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.620
it was the fight of the night on the biggest card of UFC history.

1634
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.600
You'll see two oh five in Madison Square Garden.

1635
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.420
According to them it was a best fight of the entire card.

1636
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.430
So if that was the best fight and it was fine

1637
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.100
<v 2>cause he had got the award,</v>

1638
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:13.701
a fight of the night.

1639
00:43:13.701 --> 00:43:13.960
Yeah.

1640
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.420
Yeah.

1641
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.650
That's just so you can get a bonus though,

1642
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:16.370
right?

1643
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:21.370
I mean when you look at the fights in terms of like you could have a card where

1644
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:26.330
there's a lot of fights that aren't entirely significant and that would be the

1645
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:27.164
fight of the night.

1646
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.030
I don't think there's anything wrong with that fight.

1647
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:29.691
I've told you before,

1648
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.530
I liked that fight.

1649
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.440
<v 1>Well as a UFC,</v>

1650
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:34.720
the people that are cash any checks if they deem,

1651
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.830
cause they didn't want to make decisions.

1652
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.070
Right.

1653
00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:36.940
Dana and whoever,

1654
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.790
if they say that this fight was a fight of the night,

1655
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.930
which means you get more money,

1656
00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.160
you get more money,

1657
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.210
come back a couple more bucks.

1658
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.290
But think about this,

1659
00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.390
how different was the sacrifice?

1660
00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.740
It was really kind of the same fight,

1661
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.633
pretty much the same.

1662
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.770
So how was that fight fight at night?

1663
00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:53.080
It didn't have very exact fucking fight.

1664
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.570
A few months later is a boring fight.

1665
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.590
Get it.

1666
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.920
What happened there for said it's boring.

1667
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.270
If you said it's born the worst,

1668
00:44:04.271 --> 00:44:05.104
who says born?

1669
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.400
If Dana says born,

1670
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.690
the world's going to say it's boring.

1671
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.500
So,

1672
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:08.621
well,

1673
00:44:08.621 --> 00:44:09.480
I never said it was better.

1674
00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:10.100
I'm just saying.

1675
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.470
<v 2>I'd say if you look at the result after the fact,</v>

1676
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.100
people might say that if you knew what happened during the fight and you might

1677
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:16.281
say,

1678
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:16.521
well,

1679
00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:17.900
it's boring to watch again,

1680
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:21.050
but watching it live was not boring at all because the consequences are so

1681
00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:21.740
grave.

1682
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:22.880
It's one of the things that I pointed out,

1683
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:25.400
like if Wonderboy fucks up,

1684
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.450
he's going to sleep.

1685
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.860
If you fuck up,

1686
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.100
you're going to get kicked in the head too.

1687
00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.070
Like anything can go wrong in that fight.

1688
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:31.621
That's a very,

1689
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:31.980
David

1690
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.240
<v 3>didn't say it as a boring fight.</v>

1691
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:34.051
What he said was,

1692
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:34.884
man,

1693
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.490
the way you,

1694
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.260
the way you let go on him in that period.

1695
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:38.070
You know?

1696
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.630
Why don't you just do that every time?

1697
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.500
Crazy.

1698
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.040
I said,

1699
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.873
Dana,

1700
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.863
I said,

1701
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.410
when I let go is because I see the opening when I see it open and you will

1702
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:50.190
always know me to go tell me one time I've seen opening and not went and I had

1703
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:50.730
somebody hurting.

1704
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.600
I'm not trying to finish it.

1705
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:52.381
Don't you think that does?

1706
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:54.600
Just frustration for someone who's not fighting,

1707
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:58.860
who says things that aren't logical to you as a guy who was a champion,

1708
00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.753
who is fighting?

1709
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.230
It's,

1710
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.910
these are people saying what?

1711
00:45:01.911 --> 00:45:02.700
His Dad,

1712
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.300
but as damaging witness to president when the president says it,

1713
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.760
especially when you got the cultish following,

1714
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.170
whatever he says is going to go.

1715
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:10.741
If they say,

1716
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.720
Damien Maia was born everybody,

1717
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:17.100
and they're not making machines where if he say Tyron Woodley in Damien Maia,

1718
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:17.911
all my God,

1719
00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:19.260
that fucking fight was boring.

1720
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.351
Somebody goes,

1721
00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:20.630
sweet,

1722
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.301
Tyron Woodley,

1723
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:21.931
Damien Maia.

1724
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:22.651
Oh my God,

1725
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:23.770
that fucking fight is born.

1726
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.930
They're not even gonna change a word.

1727
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.070
That's what we have.

1728
00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:31.220
So as a champion and in a position of being supposedly being promoted at that

1729
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:32.611
place,

1730
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:33.540
it becomes damaging.

1731
00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:35.490
So now how are you going to come back and say,

1732
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:35.761
okay,

1733
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:36.594
towers back,

1734
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.710
it showed us fix.

1735
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.290
He's wanting to fucking most devastating guys out there.

1736
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.680
You know,

1737
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.030
knock your mother fucking head off.

1738
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.570
But then five minutes ago you just say he was born and you know what I mean?

1739
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:45.980
It's,

1740
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.910
it's very hard.

1741
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:47.851
I see what you're saying.

1742
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:49.140
We're not talking about two different things.

1743
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:53.160
What you're saying is you feel like the way they talked about you after the

1744
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:58.161
fight was damaging and she was respectful and and also not accurate in terms of

1745
00:46:00.601 --> 00:46:03.540
the consequences of your actions in the fire and nobody ain't,

1746
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:04.250
nobody came through.

1747
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.561
I was like,

1748
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:04.861
Damn,

1749
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:05.694
you know what?

1750
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.110
At to find out this motherfucker,

1751
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:11.700
Tory has gotten them labor room in the first round and he still didn't give a

1752
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:12.900
one damn takedown,

1753
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.600
didn't hardly get touched at all in the entire fight.

1754
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.280
Maybe Punch two or three times total.

1755
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.710
And that's kind of clutch she's motherfucker got,

1756
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.210
he must got fucking strong.

1757
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:22.303
You would like to hear,

1758
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.651
no,

1759
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:24.330
I don't want to hear anything because I want to fight.

1760
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.253
But you're saying,

1761
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:25.850
you're saying,

1762
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:26.250
I'm saying,

1763
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.060
I'm saying that,

1764
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.590
I'm saying that it was a choice made to say one thing but,

1765
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.620
but it was also lies off the cuff.

1766
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:31.980
Right.

1767
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.600
And that's always been the thing about them,

1768
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.620
but it's also you can also fly off the cuff in the other direction.

1769
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.580
You can also say,

1770
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:38.881
hey,

1771
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:40.350
this person's fucking next superstar.

1772
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:40.771
I'm a guy.

1773
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:41.640
And gone was crazy.

1774
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.091
Oh my God,

1775
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.560
Cody Garbrandt his fucking the man.

1776
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.161
Oh my God.

1777
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:44.790
Page van Zandt.

1778
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.930
This on my main says York cut that you can say that and what's what happened to

1779
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.010
the 2 million followers?

1780
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.920
2 million followers and that makes a big difference.

1781
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.540
But that can happen to you at any moment.

1782
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.170
You were frustrated by the reaction to three particular fights.

1783
00:46:59.090 --> 00:46:59.740
You definitely,

1784
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.280
you want me to be fresh settled down fella.

1785
00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:01.710
I know.

1786
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.543
I want to tell you to secret.

1787
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.530
I'm working like hell right now.

1788
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:05.980
I know you are and I'm not for sure.

1789
00:47:05.981 --> 00:47:06.690
I know you are.

1790
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.930
I'm doing a lot of automotive work,

1791
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:14.060
unhappy with certain things and this unhappiness stems from the result of three

1792
00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:14.761
fights.

1793
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:17.130
But if you look at one fight before that,

1794
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:18.240
the Robbie Lawler fight,

1795
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.720
I mean everybody was talking about you lucky with the most devastating thing of

1796
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:22.201
all time.

1797
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:24.180
The fact that you were able to do that to Robbie Lawler,

1798
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.710
all you need is one or two more fights like that kind of forgets about Damien

1799
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.960
Maia.

1800
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.740
You what happened?

1801
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.080
You

1802
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.913
<v 1>want me to be,</v>

1803
00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:32.260
no,

1804
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.093
I don't.

1805
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:33.911
Well,

1806
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:34.600
let me tell you this.

1807
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.381
I definitely don't,

1808
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:36.670
I'm really not frustrated him.

1809
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:37.360
Okay.

1810
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.440
Now he playing cool guy.

1811
00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:38.790
I see.

1812
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:39.760
I'm not frustrated.

1813
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.880
I just know my deck of cards and I got a very thick layer of skin and I'm very,

1814
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.770
I'm very cautious of who I am and my brand.

1815
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.813
Now when you

1816
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.040
<v 2>do the division right and you're a champ,</v>

1817
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:51.990
you're at the top of the food chain,

1818
00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:53.700
what do you see in front of you?

1819
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:54.301
Like what,

1820
00:47:54.301 --> 00:47:55.260
what threats,

1821
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.500
what,

1822
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.100
what fighters do you think are present unique challenges?

1823
00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:00.143
None.

1824
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.541
Well,

1825
00:48:00.541 --> 00:48:03.230
what do you think is next for you if you just forget about the supervisor?

1826
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.680
<v 1>I think the deck needs to be shuffled.</v>

1827
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:06.670
And I think when I come back,

1828
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:07.391
uh,

1829
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:07.781
I think what,

1830
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:08.614
I'll come back,

1831
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:09.851
I take that back.

1832
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:10.780
Carlos Mendez is dope.

1833
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.720
He's frigging,

1834
00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.521
he's fighting this weekend,

1835
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:14.650
tomorrow spoons and Mario says Batman

1836
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.780
<v 2>and he's a guy that a lot of people are not talking about</v>

1837
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.450
<v 1>straight forward for a lot of reasons.</v>

1838
00:48:18.451 --> 00:48:20.670
And I'm okay to talk about it because,

1839
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.091
you know,

1840
00:48:21.091 --> 00:48:22.200
I've always been honest.

1841
00:48:22.201 --> 00:48:23.280
He's very tough.

1842
00:48:23.281 --> 00:48:24.750
He's a good style match up for me,

1843
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:25.890
um,

1844
00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.480
to present a lot of challenges.

1845
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.531
He's a good wrestler.

1846
00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:29.400
He's very strong.

1847
00:48:29.401 --> 00:48:32.160
He started to come along with his hands and I like,

1848
00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:36.570
if I'm a fight somebody and it's on some number one contender shit shit,

1849
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.711
I want to fight somebody.

1850
00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:39.750
I respect somebody like Rda,

1851
00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:40.440
somebody like,

1852
00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.280
Ooh Smith till pots and evo does these dudes are,

1853
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:45.450
these dudes are savages.

1854
00:48:45.451 --> 00:48:46.440
And you know,

1855
00:48:46.441 --> 00:48:47.340
not to sound cocky,

1856
00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:49.680
but I think my toughest challenges are behind me.

1857
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.030
I think Carlos Condit and Robbie Lawler and at the time and costs check was

1858
00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:54.990
almost a few fights,

1859
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:55.620
you know,

1860
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.790
way from fighting George.

1861
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:58.920
And you know those guys at that moment,

1862
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.840
those guys presented a lot of problems.

1863
00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.550
Kasha kept the same overhand right.

1864
00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:04.440
Just a little bit different wrestling,

1865
00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:05.310
Great Chin.

1866
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.450
I'm great conditioning.

1867
00:49:06.451 --> 00:49:07.440
A lot of experience.

1868
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.891
You know,

1869
00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:08.131
it was a,

1870
00:49:08.131 --> 00:49:08.911
it was a threat for me.

1871
00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:11.010
Robbie Lawler was a fighter a year back to back.

1872
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:11.461
You know,

1873
00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:14.300
it has some of the craziest fights we've ever seen in fucking lip hanging open

1874
00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:16.260
and he's bleeding and that's to do it.

1875
00:49:16.261 --> 00:49:17.970
I had to walk and he was a Boogie man at the time.

1876
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.580
So for me to get bubble guts,

1877
00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.530
don't nobody have that power.

1878
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.880
Then Nate Marco did.

1879
00:49:23.881 --> 00:49:24.810
When he knocked me the hell out.

1880
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.910
I'll never be hit that hard again in my life.

1881
00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:32.340
Think Colby Covington cause he's gonna Punch me and make me like went and back

1882
00:49:32.341 --> 00:49:32.551
up.

1883
00:49:32.551 --> 00:49:34.690
Now look at how he was punching me and Maya,

1884
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.120
it was a rabbit punches.

1885
00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:38.520
So if you don't have great wrestling,

1886
00:49:38.521 --> 00:49:39.450
great wrestling defense,

1887
00:49:39.451 --> 00:49:41.340
great conditioning and powering your hand,

1888
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.870
you're just not going to give me butterflies.

1889
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:43.151
<v 2>Well,</v>

1890
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:46.810
I think for sure you have accomplished some great things and fought some amazing

1891
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:48.880
fights against some very dangerous challenges.

1892
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:49.571
I mean,

1893
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:50.590
there's no doubt about that.

1894
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:51.640
No one could deny that.

1895
00:49:51.641 --> 00:49:54.940
And those fights that you did just talk about Carlos Condit,

1896
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.500
particularly Robbie Lawler,

1897
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.390
Josh Koscheck in his prime,

1898
00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.470
amazing fights,

1899
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:00.363
great results.

1900
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.460
But when you talk about [inaudible],

1901
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:03.910
we talk about Rda,

1902
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:08.200
you talk about Darren till you're talking about also potential amazing fights.

1903
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:08.980
You know,

1904
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.840
I think there's a lot of outstanding opportunity and I think your divisions,

1905
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.800
one of the most talent rich divisions in the sport.

1906
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.230
<v 1>I'm not discrediting that.</v>

1907
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.960
I think that I'm always a forward thinking dude.

1908
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.140
So the teal guy didn't sneak up on me.

1909
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.330
Neither do you saw till in advance.

1910
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.193
You saw him.

1911
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:25.930
I'm going to tell you,

1912
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:26.763
I do this right.

1913
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.830
At one point in time,

1914
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:28.970
it was Brandon thatch.

1915
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.430
It was Eric silver.

1916
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.720
It was,

1917
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:33.140
um,

1918
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.190
Kevin gas alum.

1919
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:35.960
It was Stephen Thompson.

1920
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.470
Okay.

1921
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:37.400
Brandon Thatch,

1922
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.200
Eric Silver,

1923
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.080
kind of doing it the way gasoline went up and fought me.

1924
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.190
Stephen Thompson went up.

1925
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.160
So now these the,

1926
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.840
the Darren till the [inaudible] man.

1927
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:49.640
All those guys during that same pool.

1928
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.300
So I'm always thinking about training.

1929
00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:53.930
I was thinking about fighting these guys always game planning for these guys

1930
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:55.970
before they even come up at some point.

1931
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.420
I don't have to fight everybody cause they got,

1932
00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:58.490
they going to cancel each other out.

1933
00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.990
If it's five studs,

1934
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.370
I might walk into three of them.

1935
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:02.570
So I got to be ready.

1936
00:51:02.571 --> 00:51:04.100
Damien Maia wasn't a surprise.

1937
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.750
I asked for Damien Maia,

1938
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.200
I fought Jake shields or somebody,

1939
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:11.870
somebody I fought and my manager was like,

1940
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:12.141
dude,

1941
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:12.951
why are you going to fight Damien?

1942
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:15.620
Maia may suck at such a bs and this is this,

1943
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.483
this and now I'm like,

1944
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.260
I know this on paper,

1945
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:19.430
Rory Mcdonald's,

1946
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.200
my toughest matchup in the division right now.

1947
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.633
Okay.

1948
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.090
Even when Ellenberger was a stud and was fucking wrecking people because of his

1949
00:51:26.091 --> 00:51:26.481
power,

1950
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:28.280
his wrestling and his condition,

1951
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.500
him and Johnny Hendricks also would have been a threat.

1952
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:31.521
What guys?

1953
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.354
Where I was trying to fight,

1954
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.330
let me get Johnny Hendricks for foreign former champion.

1955
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.411
We're even Donald.

1956
00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:38.150
So I was going up against the guys,

1957
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:41.120
Carlos Condit still today might be my favorite fighter.

1958
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.710
So when I watched his video,

1959
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.840
I was getting bottom like this motherfucker good.

1960
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.550
I was still in his techniques,

1961
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.960
but what happened when I fought him?

1962
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.160
Did he look like the same quality county?

1963
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:50.490
He looked,

1964
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:50.661
no,

1965
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:51.494
I punched him.

1966
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.690
He looked like a ratchet was snatching them across the,

1967
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:54.260
you know,

1968
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.250
across the octagon.

1969
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.640
It wasn't like I just kicked him in the knee and all my God,

1970
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.840
he was going to win.

1971
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:00.021
No,

1972
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:02.510
he was getting dominated that fight because I did my homework.

1973
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:07.050
I respect him that much that I took all his tools and I left him naked out there

1974
00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.400
in the octagon and he had to deal with my suite and he had deal my power.

1975
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:11.780
That's what I do to everybody.

1976
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:12.770
Nobody sees it.

1977
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.160
They think I'm just just strong ass fucking wrestler with a hard right hand.

1978
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.410
But look at the way that Jordan me and looked against me.

1979
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.030
Look at the way the Teryx happening.

1980
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:21.290
I all short Paul Day,

1981
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:23.600
the Kelvin Gosling is never looked like that.

1982
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:24.500
It gives anybody else.

1983
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.190
Same thing with Steve and same thing with a Maya.

1984
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.050
Same thing with Condi.

1985
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:30.230
And same thing with Robbie is not,

1986
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:31.280
it's not a surprise.

1987
00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.040
That's the way that Duke in Dean and I,

1988
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:34.760
we,

1989
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.840
we address what we,

1990
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:38.420
if I'm fighting me fight tower in this way,

1991
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.890
take them to the late round,

1992
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:40.970
kick his leg,

1993
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.330
stay away from his power circuit.

1994
00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:42.980
It's way.

1995
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.860
So now I'm gonna formulate my game plan about what I think you think of me.

1996
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.280
Then I think about every fucking thing that you do,

1997
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.721
every skill,

1998
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:51.554
every talent,

1999
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.420
every mannerism.

2000
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.660
What you do when you get tired,

2001
00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.650
what you're going to go to,

2002
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:55.131
what's your bread,

2003
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:55.910
butter.

2004
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.390
And I get ready for those and it's sometime it's like Robbie took a long time.

2005
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:01.850
It took up until the week of the fight for me to be like,

2006
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.050
I got this motherfucker.

2007
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.890
And what was it?

2008
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:04.723
There was different.

2009
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.320
He just punched really awkwardly.

2010
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:08.450
He punched his arms are way longer than what you think.

2011
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.170
Um,

2012
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.441
he,

2013
00:53:09.441 --> 00:53:09.780
he's,

2014
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.370
he's got way better boxing then when you think he doesn't look all like,

2015
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.990
like you see somebody slipping the stuff.

2016
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:15.950
Um,

2017
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:16.280
he,

2018
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:20.000
he threw a lot of unorthodox overhand lefts and upper cuts.

2019
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:20.834
And right kicks,

2020
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.600
which makes it very difficult to slip offline and throw any punches.

2021
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.920
He was scrambled first shot,

2022
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:26.551
if you shoot a shot,

2023
00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:27.570
he'll scramble you hard.

2024
00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:28.381
You have to shoot two,

2025
00:53:28.381 --> 00:53:28.651
three,

2026
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:30.210
four attempts to get him to the ground.

2027
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.540
He had one butterfly that he used to sweep to get off the ground.

2028
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.130
So we just knew all that.

2029
00:53:35.131 --> 00:53:39.780
And then at any point he can play rope a dope and then he can come off swinging.

2030
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.790
So that's a lot of things to think about.

2031
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.000
And then he just can stand here like this and go boom.

2032
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:45.930
And you knocked out.

2033
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.160
Not Technique,

2034
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:48.120
not turning the hips.

2035
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.760
He just had heavy hands naturally.

2036
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:53.640
So thus all was a threat and we've seen them in wars,

2037
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:54.930
he's not going to go away.

2038
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.310
So I had to,

2039
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:56.580
you know,

2040
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.370
formulate a game plan that I can get around all that.

2041
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.080
Now when you saw the RDA,

2042
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.370
Robbie Lawler fight,

2043
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.020
you said that you weren't really impressed with that fight because RDA had him

2044
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:12.021
against the octagon and he was 10 off of 30,000 punches and he didn't knock him

2045
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:13.500
down and he didn't hurt him.

2046
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:16.590
He was basically just punching the punch.

2047
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.210
Anytime you punched the punch,

2048
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.590
he wasn't your energy.

2049
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:19.741
Well,

2050
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:23.940
he's going up in weight and he's more volume now than he was when he was

2051
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:24.331
fighting him.

2052
00:54:24.331 --> 00:54:25.051
Rda Five.

2053
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:25.410
Yeah,

2054
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.243
I think it's fine.

2055
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:26.521
Hey,

2056
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:29.190
you here now we're energy me when you get here now,

2057
00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:30.330
I mean if you,

2058
00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:31.141
if you make the jump,

2059
00:54:31.141 --> 00:54:31.860
you make the jump.

2060
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.221
You know,

2061
00:54:32.221 --> 00:54:32.881
you can't be like,

2062
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:33.141
I'm on.

2063
00:54:33.141 --> 00:54:36.120
I was aware I was a lightweight and now he's a welterweight,

2064
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:41.920
but his style is different than especially a guy like you throws this.

2065
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.110
This is my thought on Ravi.

2066
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:43.890
Okay.

2067
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:46.970
A lot of people I picked Robbie apart in,

2068
00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:47.240
in,

2069
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:47.580
in,

2070
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.440
in the film room before I even followed them.

2071
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:52.140
And the fight was over with before the fight started.

2072
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.120
Robberies starts out the first 30 seconds,

2073
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:54.954
extremely hard.

2074
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:55.771
He ends the first,

2075
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:56.100
second,

2076
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:56.671
30 seconds,

2077
00:54:56.671 --> 00:54:57.504
extremely hard.

2078
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.700
Second and fourth round of Kinda close.

2079
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:00.630
He's going forward.

2080
00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:01.464
You're going forward.

2081
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.730
He'll take something to give some.

2082
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:03.840
Okay.

2083
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.231
They're right.

2084
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:05.130
He used to takes off.

2085
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.110
You ever notice that he gets,

2086
00:55:07.111 --> 00:55:07.681
he gets a case,

2087
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:08.110
he's confident.

2088
00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:08.720
His defense.

2089
00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.140
He'll let you punching and he'll block you.

2090
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.680
Okay?

2091
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.680
He wants wastes a lot of energy so he can get into that second gear.

2092
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:17.340
It's not that he's so well conditioned why she's fighting against Carlos.

2093
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:19.620
Why should his fight against Roy Watch his fight against Rda.

2094
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:23.130
He spent that same moment against the octagon where he allowed the opponent,

2095
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:23.964
the punch at him.

2096
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.050
The same thing with Johnny.

2097
00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:27.630
Then he came off trying to get to in the burn themselves out.

2098
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.740
It's very smart,

2099
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.520
but if everyone would act like he just freaking marathon runner and he's not.

2100
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:34.470
So when that happened,

2101
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:34.771
I said,

2102
00:55:34.771 --> 00:55:35.604
okay,

2103
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.470
you got to get on Robbie Hart.

2104
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.610
You got to get a rabbit quick.

2105
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:39.900
He's been punched a lot.

2106
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.100
Like I did all every fucking statue.

2107
00:55:42.101 --> 00:55:42.840
You can take a hair,

2108
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.441
raccoon,

2109
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:44.040
the fighting omics.

2110
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.330
The guy hit me up saying,

2111
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:46.740
Robbie has a flat face.

2112
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.480
You punched fat face.

2113
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:50.220
He's used to absorbing those punches.

2114
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.600
Go around the side,

2115
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.790
punched him on the jawline.

2116
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.730
Kind of crazy logic.

2117
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:54.361
As a man,

2118
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.290
I'll use everything.

2119
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.560
I can tell you how many times he stepped to the fucking left during a fight.

2120
00:55:58.561 --> 00:56:00.330
How many times you throw his right hand versus left hand.

2121
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:01.830
So you know,

2122
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.040
I've been really secretive about a lot of this stuff because most people just

2123
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:06.150
see me as an athlete,

2124
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:10.330
they just punch hard as a good wrestler that you know that's tough and you know,

2125
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.940
you know good game plan.

2126
00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:16.941
But I really overly get obsessed with studying my opponents to the point where

2127
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:19.890
when Mazda I fighting Wonderboy,

2128
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:20.280
I'm like,

2129
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.113
he about to do this,

2130
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.900
he about to do that.

2131
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:22.471
He's throwing this,

2132
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:23.111
he set this up,

2133
00:56:23.111 --> 00:56:23.661
look towards you.

2134
00:56:23.661 --> 00:56:24.310
There you go.

2135
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.270
Oh he bought did it.

2136
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:26.170
And everybody looking at me like,

2137
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:27.610
how the fuck do you know what I say?

2138
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:30.640
You motherfuckers watch that fight that I followed them and you thought it was

2139
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.690
so easy.

2140
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.070
Get Yo ass in there.

2141
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:33.560
And that one,

2142
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:33.891
the boys,

2143
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:35.840
so one of the boys a g and he,

2144
00:56:35.841 --> 00:56:38.350
he can take a punch way better than I thought.

2145
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:42.580
I hit us as hard and he went out three or four times and he just had the

2146
00:56:42.581 --> 00:56:42.971
mentality,

2147
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:44.710
I'm not going to lose her then I'm not going to lose today.

2148
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.770
And he was rewarded for that effort or just saying,

2149
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:48.604
you know what,

2150
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:50.650
I'm going to give it all I got and um,

2151
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.210
he'll forever have my respect.

2152
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:54.010
But at the end of the day,

2153
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.280
you gotta be able to be honest with yourself.

2154
00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.570
I'm honest with who I am,

2155
00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.530
what I do well,

2156
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.690
I'm not the best at elbows.

2157
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.040
Can I throw elbows?

2158
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:03.640
Yes.

2159
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.320
But am I going to sit out there and act like I'm,

2160
00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:05.860
you know,

2161
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.880
Matt Brown and somebody?

2162
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:07.121
No,

2163
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:08.340
that's his still Matt,

2164
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.310
Brian and goes storm.

2165
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:10.900
You're across the octagon like I will.

2166
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.020
So once I see what I do well and I,

2167
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:14.350
you know,

2168
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:16.870
I can hide my weaknesses behind my strengths.

2169
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.650
I can allow my opponents never to put me in a spot where they're going to have

2170
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:24.610
the advantage to Damien Maia ever put me in a position where he had me in his

2171
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:25.180
half guard.

2172
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:25.810
No,

2173
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.643
never did it.

2174
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.091
But you still,

2175
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:32.890
you didn't think that RDAs performance against Robbie Lawler was impressive

2176
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.660
because he overwhelmed Robbie.

2177
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.261
I mean,

2178
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:35.820
he had turns,

2179
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:36.653
turns I'm going to fight.

2180
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:37.973
I don't know,

2181
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:38.880
thinking mitre.

2182
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.260
I tell I from a time thinking about,

2183
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.490
from a tactical standpoint,

2184
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:43.360
I thought find out.

2185
00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.290
I thought he had some really good success with low kicks and I thought he kind

2186
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:48.010
of abandoned that.

2187
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.780
I was kind of surprised that he didn't do that.

2188
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:51.003
And um,

2189
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:51.371
then I,

2190
00:57:51.371 --> 00:57:53.540
I saw Robbie do the roper dope.

2191
00:57:53.541 --> 00:57:54.970
But Robbie never came off normally.

2192
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:55.481
Like I said,

2193
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:56.820
Robbie take some punches to,

2194
00:57:56.821 --> 00:57:57.610
he'll come on storm.

2195
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:00.640
You never came out of stone or maybe it was because he messed his leg up or

2196
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:01.474
whatever.

2197
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.313
But just from,

2198
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.140
from two people that they want to say he's gonna fight me next,

2199
00:58:05.141 --> 00:58:06.370
let me fight somebody.

2200
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.750
And it's a DDS hurt.

2201
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.070
Lawler fought

2202
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:10.581
<v 2>RDA.</v>

2203
00:58:10.581 --> 00:58:11.600
Seriously injured.

2204
00:58:11.601 --> 00:58:13.340
Now those injuries have been revealed.

2205
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.020
Let's see what we got here was to say,

2206
00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:16.893
um,

2207
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:22.300
destroy blew his ACL and meniscus and every other thing that's in your knee out

2208
00:58:22.551 --> 00:58:25.640
in the third round said wobbled over to the fence.

2209
00:58:25.641 --> 00:58:26.474
So it makes sense.

2210
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:27.220
Yeah

2211
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.610
<v 1>they sent it cause cause,</v>

2212
00:58:28.611 --> 00:58:31.670
cause if Robbie is notoriously known for,

2213
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:32.031
you know,

2214
00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:35.450
like think about when Rory had him against the octagon with collars Kinda.

2215
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.910
And he comes out and he comes out blasting.

2216
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:39.030
But it's so I,

2217
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:41.750
since it said he hurt himself before the fight though,

2218
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.750
other article I was going to pull up,

2219
00:58:44.751 --> 00:58:45.740
but I found that that said,

2220
00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:45.861
yeah,

2221
00:58:45.861 --> 00:58:47.090
he was injured going into the fight.

2222
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.880
Who tore his ACL before to fight during the fight.

2223
00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:50.773
Find that,

2224
00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:52.091
<v 2>well it said that,</v>

2225
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:53.320
the title of that though,

2226
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:54.280
go back to that real quick.

2227
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:56.840
The title of it said who was seriously injured going into the

2228
00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:57.360
<v 1>fight,</v>

2229
00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.193
right.

2230
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.810
Injured and then the entries have been revealed.

2231
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.411
Oh,

2232
00:59:01.411 --> 00:59:01.800
okay.

2233
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:01.981
Yeah.

2234
00:59:01.981 --> 00:59:03.030
So that's it.

2235
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.170
I think that was had to throw round,

2236
00:59:04.171 --> 00:59:04.700
right?

2237
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:05.230
Yeah.

2238
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.800
Yeah.

2239
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.640
Right when you were saying that he lays off.

2240
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.180
Yeah.

2241
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:08.640
So,

2242
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.420
so,

2243
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:09.991
so he,

2244
00:59:09.991 --> 00:59:10.830
so he didn't,

2245
00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.210
he didn't come off all you,

2246
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.510
you can't go to a thread on the forum posts.

2247
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:15.963
That's at short.

2248
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.280
You can't go to the thread on as well.

2249
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:18.143
Nobody,

2250
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:19.411
but yeah.

2251
00:59:19.411 --> 00:59:20.130
You know what,

2252
00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:20.963
that would make sense.

2253
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.040
I'm

2254
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.350
<v 3>used to Robbie coming off and getting those 32nd bursts.</v>

2255
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.370
Like,

2256
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:26.480
I don't know exactly.

2257
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.360
Not talked to big John about this for a while about the judging.

2258
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:30.194
Right.

2259
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:31.280
And you know,

2260
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:32.480
damage being landed.

2261
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.140
So some of those fights where even if Robbie wasn't the more active one,

2262
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.630
he's damaging people more cause he punched.

2263
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:39.140
Pardon?

2264
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.220
Is more aggressive.

2265
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.650
But how can Carlos condit control the fact that he just don't punch his hardest?

2266
00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.493
Robbie,

2267
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:45.890
you know,

2268
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:46.580
she'd be pissed off.

2269
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.590
Did you think he beat I'm rubbing in a fight.

2270
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:50.080
I'd have to go back and washed out again.

2271
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:50.923
I thought it was at that time.

2272
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.560
At that time.

2273
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.393
Did you think it,

2274
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.540
I don't think I did.

2275
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:54.050
I thought,

2276
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:57.950
I think I thought that Hendricks did or that Robbie did.

2277
00:59:57.951 --> 00:59:58.910
Just enough to win.

2278
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.691
What did,

2279
00:59:59.691 --> 01:00:01.880
I'd have to go back and I'd have to go back and watch it again.

2280
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.310
I thought at that moment that Carlos one,

2281
01:00:04.311 --> 01:00:05.150
but I wasn't like,

2282
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.871
oh my God,

2283
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:07.040
I can't believe they gave him some Robbie,

2284
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:08.540
but it was extremely close.

2285
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:12.830
You can make an argument for either guy wouldn't put Robbie because he landed.

2286
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:16.100
The more harder can talk harder punching it looks scarier.

2287
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.720
I think that's why he got denied.

2288
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.810
That means something though.

2289
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.520
I mean,

2290
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:19.880
uh,

2291
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.990
someone who hits harder,

2292
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.130
it has more damage.

2293
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:24.080
That damage should be accumulated.

2294
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:25.800
I mean that should be somewhat so up.

2295
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.710
So someone's throws punches in,

2296
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.560
it looks like it's effecting the person more.

2297
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.640
Even if the other person throw more in landmark,

2298
01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.040
then the person is landing the damage and punches.

2299
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:34.820
You think she went.

2300
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.660
I think damage should count for more than punches.

2301
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:39.650
It don't damage.

2302
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.560
So like if one person has that the way that they supposed to score now,

2303
01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:43.010
currently,

2304
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:43.640
I don't know.

2305
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.473
I mean the new,

2306
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.690
it's what's interesting is Nevada still doesn't accept the new rules.

2307
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:50.630
They need to get the crane ones right before they tried to bring in the new

2308
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:51.464
ones.

2309
01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:51.920
Yeah.

2310
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.250
But what's also interesting is the scores are much wider now.

2311
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.070
Like you see a lot more 10 eights now than the other side before,

2312
01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.420
which I think is good.

2313
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:03.890
I just think that we're our system taking a system from boxing that only uses

2314
01:01:03.891 --> 01:01:07.340
hands and applying that to take down some mission attempts.

2315
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.203
Leg Kicks.

2316
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.630
You would almost have to know this guys,

2317
01:01:10.631 --> 01:01:12.020
is you get to world champion.

2318
01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:14.180
The fact that this guy swept him,

2319
01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:16.460
he should score more because this guy,

2320
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:17.010
this is,

2321
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:17.290
you know,

2322
01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:17.841
real house,

2323
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:18.740
but nobody's going.

2324
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.030
No judge is gonna have that,

2325
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:20.391
you know,

2326
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:21.170
insight.

2327
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.330
I think it should be a much broader system.

2328
01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:24.920
I don't think it should be 10 points at all.

2329
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.500
I think you're dealing with extreme amounts of variables.

2330
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:29.450
It should be like almost like a hundred point system.

2331
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.600
The guy that raft my fight against Wonderboy the first time,

2332
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:33.591
the one that,

2333
01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:34.424
um,

2334
01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.570
was one judge,

2335
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:37.190
they gave a 10,

2336
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.181
10,

2337
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:41.390
eight the first round and the ten nine the fourth round,

2338
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.910
fourth round is when I knocked him down three times.

2339
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:44.211
Yeah.

2340
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:46.590
The ten eight was when you almost got him in the gay teens.

2341
01:01:46.591 --> 01:01:47.790
Is that why he no,

2342
01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:47.951
no,

2343
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:48.190
no,

2344
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.490
no.

2345
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.323
That,

2346
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.920
I was getting McGinty and in the fourth round.

2347
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:52.730
Yeah.

2348
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:53.780
And he said,

2349
01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:54.880
well,

2350
01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.420
why did I think you almost kind of in a gay the first round in the first fight,

2351
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.201
the first fight,

2352
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:01.850
the first one I just ground and pound the hell out of him.

2353
01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:02.511
I took him down.

2354
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.040
And as you beat him up for the whole round,

2355
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.300
um,

2356
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.380
he gave that round a 10,

2357
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:07.460
eight or so.

2358
01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:09.600
It was the fourth round where you got them in the gift.

2359
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.770
The fourth one is when I knocked them down and knock them down again,

2360
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.160
I knocked him down again and then I went for the get tank,

2361
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.760
knocked him down three times,

2362
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:17.581
and then we forget to you.

2363
01:02:17.581 --> 01:02:18.710
And the judge told me,

2364
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.153
he said,

2365
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:21.811
<v 1>you know,</v>

2366
01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:22.680
I thought it was a 10,

2367
01:02:22.681 --> 01:02:23.340
eight round,

2368
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.700
you know,

2369
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.330
but then you wasted a minute and a good team wasted a minute.

2370
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.910
They told me now that I had just got over this shit,

2371
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:30.490
right.

2372
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:30.820
I was,

2373
01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:35.820
I was just fucking said that said that I had just got over the fact that I felt

2374
01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:38.580
like it was some bullshit.

2375
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.930
I got over that fact.

2376
01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:40.591
So,

2377
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:40.930
you know,

2378
01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:41.820
whatever it is what it is,

2379
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.460
let's do it again.

2380
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.470
This time I'm fucking beat him.

2381
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.600
This motherfucker walk up to me,

2382
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.610
not even know who he is.

2383
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:47.990
Say,

2384
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.660
man,

2385
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.351
I just wanna let you know.

2386
01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:51.080
I just your fight and um,

2387
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:51.923
you know,

2388
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.490
I'm the one that gave you the ten eight in the first round and tending to

2389
01:02:54.491 --> 01:02:54.721
fourth,

2390
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:57.660
Ron did all of a sudden my insides just start burning and then he's like,

2391
01:02:57.661 --> 01:02:57.931
you know,

2392
01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.430
I just want to explain to you why.

2393
01:02:59.460 --> 01:02:59.701
You know,

2394
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:00.780
cause I don't have a problem with,

2395
01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:01.021
you know,

2396
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:02.200
facing the fighters afterwards.

2397
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:03.601
You know,

2398
01:03:03.601 --> 01:03:04.411
you did well,

2399
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.620
I was going to give you a 10 round,

2400
01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:05.761
you know,

2401
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:07.860
it was crazy and you know,

2402
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:09.930
but then you wait wasted a minute and to get to him,

2403
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.700
I said,

2404
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:11.971
sir,

2405
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:12.804
let me tell you something.

2406
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.970
I said the first round,

2407
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.721
if you would have said 10,

2408
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:16.140
900,

2409
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:16.560
okay,

2410
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.030
I ground upon our bloodied him up.

2411
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:18.670
He didn't show,

2412
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.500
no offense,

2413
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:19.771
10,

2414
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:19.891
eight,

2415
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:20.041
10,

2416
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:20.161
nine,

2417
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:20.941
whatever you want to give it.

2418
01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:21.774
I'm cool with that.

2419
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.270
And I said the fourth round,

2420
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.040
I knocked him down three times and I said,

2421
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:27.940
I want to tell you a good team choke is not a,

2422
01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:28.410
um,

2423
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:29.243
it's not a waste wasted.

2424
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.600
It's not a move that you can say,

2425
01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.640
I wasted time and it's a finishing move.

2426
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.900
Heady ty.

2427
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:35.580
Ty had,

2428
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.110
he's fucking tapped out.

2429
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.640
The fight would have been over with.

2430
01:03:38.641 --> 01:03:41.070
So the fact that I tried to knock him out,

2431
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:45.180
then his neck became available to my arms.

2432
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.300
Then I grabbed his fucking neck and then I tried to choke him out.

2433
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:49.770
Then he popped his head out.

2434
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.401
Yes,

2435
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:53.220
he's tough for making it through the whole onslaught of me trying to kill him.

2436
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.010
But does that give him an extra point?

2437
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:56.551
He said,

2438
01:03:56.551 --> 01:03:57.630
but then he threw some punches.

2439
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:57.901
I said,

2440
01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:58.830
go back and watch the fight.

2441
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.060
I said,

2442
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.620
he threw a few punches from top.

2443
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:02.640
How many landed?

2444
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.870
He said,

2445
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:04.190
oh no,

2446
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:05.010
no.

2447
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:05.461
I said,

2448
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:06.294
sir,

2449
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.360
I'm said,

2450
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.540
I'm over the fight.

2451
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.580
I'm glad they didn't say I lost the fight,

2452
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.080
but the only significant damage that was landed in,

2453
01:04:15.081 --> 01:04:15.930
if I came from me,

2454
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.940
the only knockdowns only,

2455
01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:18.571
you know,

2456
01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:19.391
blood drawn,

2457
01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:21.120
the only jeopardy of someone,

2458
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.940
the referee getting involved happening when I was on the other end of it.

2459
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.670
So I just think the system sucks.

2460
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:28.170
I really think the scoring system,

2461
01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.840
they just don't let it go to the judges

2462
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.473
that,

2463
01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:34.883
you know what?

2464
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:35.970
Fuck it today.

2465
01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:36.853
I'm gonna let it go.

2466
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:37.860
Hey,

2467
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.191
you know what?

2468
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:39.440
I'm not going to try to knock to,

2469
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:41.500
I know I trust them three right there.

2470
01:04:41.501 --> 01:04:43.230
I look very trustworthy.

2471
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:46.620
I'm going to leave it in their hands and all my kids and my family and my belt,

2472
01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:47.041
I'm gonna just,

2473
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:47.341
you know,

2474
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:48.180
I'm living up to them.

2475
01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:49.950
I always hate that expression.

2476
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:51.060
I hate it because it's so,

2477
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.770
some guys don't want to be finished.

2478
01:04:52.771 --> 01:04:54.520
Most guys and Steven's case would've,

2479
01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.200
would've,

2480
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.033
would've been overweight.

2481
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.670
Um,

2482
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:57.450
you know,

2483
01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:58.290
some guys just talk,

2484
01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:58.561
I mean,

2485
01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.700
I don't want to just refinished,

2486
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:00.210
right?

2487
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:01.043
Nobody does snow.

2488
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:02.460
It's a foolish way of looking at it.

2489
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:06.900
It's just the best way to fight is the best way to fight.

2490
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:08.250
And if you see an opening,

2491
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:09.030
like you said,

2492
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:14.030
that's when you move your idea that you're supposed to just rush into danger and

2493
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:14.970
that's how you lose.

2494
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:17.070
And the fact that people don't,

2495
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:20.930
that and that people say things like that and they don't understand what they

2496
01:05:20.931 --> 01:05:22.030
really shouldn't be talking about.

2497
01:05:22.031 --> 01:05:22.864
Fighting.

2498
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.060
Fighting is a complicated thing,

2499
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.640
grinding thing.

2500
01:05:26.641 --> 01:05:27.610
And it's also,

2501
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.880
it's one sport where it's like if the team doesn't run the ball well they don't

2502
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:34.624
run the ball.

2503
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.613
They pass.

2504
01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.540
So if this is Stephen Thompson,

2505
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.190
he doesn't have to wrestle.

2506
01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.990
He doesn't have to try to do Jujitsu,

2507
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:43.180
he just have to stop you from doing it to him.

2508
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:46.270
But he's got that style that's impossible to find anywhere else.

2509
01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.860
Standing completely sideways.

2510
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.060
He's throwing front leg kicks that can knock you out and social,

2511
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:52.300
a lot of weird stuff.

2512
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:54.550
And he bends at the waist like a snake.

2513
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.070
He leads all those years of point karate,

2514
01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.450
like he's really fascinated too.

2515
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.840
It's very good kick to Raymond Daniels,

2516
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:04.690
which is a painted as sage Northcutt,

2517
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:06.190
which actually in my opinion,

2518
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.070
sparring wise was way harder than the Wonderboy.

2519
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.860
More MMA experience for sure.

2520
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:13.930
And also sidekicks ages,

2521
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.681
his sidekicks,

2522
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:15.070
he knocked,

2523
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.560
I had the word Taekwondo Pat,

2524
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:17.770
despite his age,

2525
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:18.881
he kicked me to it.

2526
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:19.420
If it's on my,

2527
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:19.751
my bad,

2528
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:20.584
Mr Woodley,

2529
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:20.910
I'm like,

2530
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:21.750
damn this motherfucker,

2531
01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:23.770
no joke,

2532
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.640
no joke.

2533
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.540
So He um,

2534
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.351
he was good.

2535
01:06:26.351 --> 01:06:30.190
I had a kid named Chris Pang and from the same background that I had another guy

2536
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.380
named Michael Tang,

2537
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:34.200
who's the taekwondo guy from the,

2538
01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.053
from the east coast.

2539
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.330
And then actually a lot of people don't know this.

2540
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:37.661
Duke,

2541
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.021
actually,

2542
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:39.880
his original base was taekwondo.

2543
01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:41.500
So having all those guys,

2544
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.310
it wasn't fun.

2545
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.180
I mean it was,

2546
01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:44.560
it was many rounds.

2547
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:45.580
I did not win.

2548
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:46.181
I mean,

2549
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:49.270
sage Northcutt kicked my ass for a couple of couple of days because I couldn't

2550
01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.790
figure out how the hell to get up on them without getting kicked in the

2551
01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.653
sidekick.

2552
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.370
They now you've got to think about it like damn door.

2553
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:55.900
How close to I get to him before he,

2554
01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:56.951
the side.

2555
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:57.710
So,

2556
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:58.010
you know,

2557
01:06:58.010 --> 01:07:02.200
it's a totally different style of movement and Wonderboy is probably the best in

2558
01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:02.810
the world.

2559
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.330
He's good.

2560
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:03.550
It's,

2561
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:07.390
it's a very complicated fight and that's why I almost had an NVP out to me,

2562
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.430
but he is,

2563
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.000
his manager was trying to get too much money.

2564
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:11.910
Michael Venom page.

2565
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.550
Oh really?

2566
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:13.480
I was gonna bring him out to,

2567
01:07:13.481 --> 01:07:14.201
he wanted to come out,

2568
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.400
but his manager,

2569
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.211
excuse me,

2570
01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:17.350
wanted me to bring him,

2571
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:18.363
bring the manager,

2572
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:19.270
bringing the friend,

2573
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:22.180
you know him all this money and get them all three different separate rental

2574
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:23.014
cars for,

2575
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.831
I said,

2576
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.600
I don't know the hell y'all think I am.

2577
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.620
What kind of money I got.

2578
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:29.890
But we not doing that for three days.

2579
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:33.760
You made a big change in your life when you started training with Duke and a lot

2580
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:37.690
of people don't know that before that you really didn't have like a main

2581
01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:38.524
trainer.

2582
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.240
It's pretty impressive.

2583
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.640
Dean's been with me for a long time,

2584
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:46.480
but as far as a coach coach every day,

2585
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:46.990
um,

2586
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.190
I put myself through stuff.

2587
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:51.160
That was all I was doing before Duke.

2588
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.181
It was just me.

2589
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:52.901
I had a gym.

2590
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:53.651
I would say,

2591
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:54.011
hey guys,

2592
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:54.870
we're going to swap this time.

2593
01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:55.541
We're going to do this.

2594
01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:55.870
I will,

2595
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.703
you know,

2596
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:57.010
you know,

2597
01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:00.040
try to just my weaknesses that I've been really blessed to have the amount of

2598
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:02.500
success I had without having a full time coach.

2599
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:04.810
Then there's just got to the point where I told Dean,

2600
01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:05.081
I said,

2601
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:05.914
man,

2602
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.780
whatever it costs me or whatever,

2603
01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:08.614
I got to pay,

2604
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.390
I need you the whole time.

2605
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:10.751
I said,

2606
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:11.360
because I can't do,

2607
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.191
I've been winging and shit.

2608
01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:13.090
I can't keep doing that.

2609
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:16.670
But what was interesting that you told me that it was son's idea file.

2610
01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:17.031
Yeah.

2611
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:19.490
You got a good memory to go to Duke and take some notes.

2612
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:21.350
No Hammer Shit.

2613
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:21.861
Yeah.

2614
01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:22.694
My side,

2615
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.151
I had,

2616
01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:23.361
um,

2617
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:25.280
who was doing an embedded thing and it was like,

2618
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:26.260
so where are we going tomorrow?

2619
01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:26.541
And I was like,

2620
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:27.374
damn,

2621
01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.870
like either tomorrow is so on a humbug and like we ain't gonna fly to Florida.

2622
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.290
I mean dean or are we going to drive to Milwaukee in the end?

2623
01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:37.060
My,

2624
01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:37.380
my,

2625
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.181
my son Darrin,

2626
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:39.014
he said,

2627
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:42.740
I think you should go to Florida quip turn tray with Ben asked aspirin and

2628
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.791
Anthony Patterson,

2629
01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:44.391
those guys.

2630
01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:45.880
And I think you should go with me.

2631
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:46.723
Milwaukee.

2632
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.631
Milwaukee.

2633
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:48.260
Yeah.

2634
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:48.980
So I said,

2635
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.970
we woke up that morning.

2636
01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:50.271
I said,

2637
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:50.621
fuck it,

2638
01:08:50.621 --> 01:08:51.770
we're going to Milwaukee.

2639
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.600
So the embedded guys,

2640
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:53.731
they,

2641
01:08:53.731 --> 01:08:54.040
they,

2642
01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.190
they actually had to drive my car.

2643
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:56.480
I was getting tired and falling asleep.

2644
01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.340
So the embedded guys driving my truck up there and we went up there.

2645
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.960
This is code negative 14 degrees.

2646
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.191
I was like,

2647
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:04.520
man,

2648
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.331
this sucks.

2649
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:06.500
I'm coming back home in a week.

2650
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:09.590
I brought eve out there who ain't never been in the colon in his life.

2651
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.180
He's acting like he was going to die.

2652
01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:12.410
But um,

2653
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.630
yeah,

2654
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:16.370
I went out there and then Duke is always invited me to come out.

2655
01:09:16.371 --> 01:09:17.720
And you don't invite a lot of guys.

2656
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.780
But Duke from Ben,

2657
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:25.010
from Anthony always saw those guys killing south Pauls.

2658
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.600
And after I talked to Duke,

2659
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:29.270
now I understand Duke's brother was a south pole.

2660
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:31.190
So his main sparring partner,

2661
01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:33.660
he learned all the tricks on how to defeat a southpaw.

2662
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.521
So I'm like,

2663
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:36.710
how did Anthony and all these guys,

2664
01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:38.810
every time they go and get somebody on the opposite stance,

2665
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:40.220
they did great against him.

2666
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:41.900
So if you do the math,

2667
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.410
everybody I fought the battle had seven fights,

2668
01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:44.570
man,

2669
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:45.403
South Pole,

2670
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.513
Robbie,

2671
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.630
Wonderboy,

2672
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.693
my uh,

2673
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:50.120
I say Wonderboy again,

2674
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.680
all go gas alum.

2675
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.090
Don't young Kim,

2676
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.510
all have been south pole and all difficult guys at South Park.

2677
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.470
And guess what?

2678
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:59.090
Everybody else in front of me,

2679
01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:01.250
you saw Paul Rda,

2680
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.431
Robby was salt,

2681
01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:05.690
Paul [inaudible] and South Paul.

2682
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:06.501
So you got,

2683
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:08.230
you got all these guys that are solid Paul.

2684
01:10:08.231 --> 01:10:12.200
So it made sense for me that only that he mates fighting fun again,

2685
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.760
I wasn't having fun with it.

2686
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.500
He made it fun to learn.

2687
01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:17.390
I felt like a kid again and you know,

2688
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.530
it was a great morality,

2689
01:10:18.531 --> 01:10:19.910
Cim and you know,

2690
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:20.210
it was,

2691
01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:22.760
I felt very specific to where I was doing.

2692
01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:24.320
I felt like I wasn't doing any training,

2693
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.990
just pushing slash and flipping shit just to say I did it.

2694
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.770
Everything had a function and I felt better and I look better.

2695
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.461
And you know,

2696
01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:32.570
I did all this training.

2697
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:35.090
I was renting my fucking self into the ground,

2698
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:36.081
doing all this,

2699
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:36.500
you know,

2700
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:36.771
three,

2701
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:38.960
four day trainings and looking all crazy.

2702
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.020
And I got into the octagon and it never showed.

2703
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.280
People were like damn man,

2704
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.821
tiring,

2705
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:44.770
I don't got their muscles.

2706
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.240
You got all those Muslims,

2707
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.270
motherfucker might get tired.

2708
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.493
So I'm like damn,

2709
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:52.120
I'm doing all this extra work but it ain't showing an octagon.

2710
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:56.320
But then I started training with dude and then and they forced me to Tyron,

2711
01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.313
trust us,

2712
01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:58.520
you're doing too much.

2713
01:10:58.580 --> 01:10:59.413
And it's not,

2714
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:04.450
if you're a sparring is affected because of your strength and conditioning,

2715
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.510
it's no longer a supplement is taking the primary and we're not in fucking

2716
01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:09.680
crossfit in fighting.

2717
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:11.420
You're sparring is number one.

2718
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.591
Anything.

2719
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:14.610
It takes your aspiring to be the best.

2720
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.510
That's what we gotta do.

2721
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.610
So we've got to run more or do less than as conditioning.

2722
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.500
If we got to actually do none,

2723
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:20.421
just spar.

2724
01:11:20.421 --> 01:11:23.910
If we gotta like there's been times I go in there and have a shitty sworn day

2725
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.950
and I said I'll see y'all in the morning.

2726
01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:26.784
We doing this again,

2727
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.870
we run it back.

2728
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:31.230
Cause in the practice room you can run it back in real life you can't.

2729
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.850
So I take advantage of,

2730
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:33.601
you know,

2731
01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:34.434
the playground.

2732
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:35.370
If you've been practicing.

2733
01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:38.040
I think now I just love fighting again.

2734
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.383
I love training.

2735
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.223
I love competing.

2736
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.063
I Love Winnie.

2737
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.270
I love that minute.

2738
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.401
Well,

2739
01:11:42.401 --> 01:11:43.170
you know you won.

2740
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:46.050
<v 3>Now how much time do you spend in Milwaukee?</v>

2741
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:48.220
Do you just move your whole camp there with cardio?

2742
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.920
Most of the time

2743
01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.280
<v 1>I had to spend some time in Florida because I'm Damian my,</v>

2744
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.900
I'll be a complete idiot if I didn't take a part of the Brazilian jujitsu black

2745
01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:59.220
belts at American top team.

2746
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:00.660
It really depends on a fight.

2747
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.060
I,

2748
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.060
I usually try to get at least four weeks.

2749
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:04.143
We Duke,

2750
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.160
the good thing about Duke,

2751
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:08.280
Duke doesn't have a huge ego and he knows what he does well,

2752
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:09.660
but he works well with other coaches.

2753
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.780
That's why him and um,

2754
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.300
Dean has been such a great dual,

2755
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.840
if I need to bring in another striking coach,

2756
01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.800
so another training partner or somebody else,

2757
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.620
he opens up the door for that because at the end of the day,

2758
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:21.500
the goal is for me to be the champion,

2759
01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:25.020
a state champion and reached my goal being the greatest welterweight of all

2760
01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:25.854
time.

2761
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:27.660
So smart guy.

2762
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.130
If there was not for that,

2763
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.330
then it be a little bit difficult.

2764
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:31.150
And also Dan lamp,

2765
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.450
you gotta realize I've been in American top team since they won.

2766
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:37.190
Dan Lambert has never been in a blue about where I'm training at,

2767
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:37.801
where I'm going.

2768
01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:42.090
I've always caught him and for him to give me the ability to go and get stuff

2769
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.040
from other coaches is also been very helpful.

2770
01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:44.391
<v 3>No,</v>

2771
01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:45.470
he's another amazing guy,

2772
01:12:45.471 --> 01:12:46.304
too.

2773
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.870
Valuable guy in MMA.

2774
01:12:47.871 --> 01:12:50.690
You think about the amount of money that he spent on American top team before he

2775
01:12:50.691 --> 01:12:51.524
made any money.

2776
01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.071
I mean,

2777
01:12:52.071 --> 01:12:54.740
that guy poured money into mixed martial arts.

2778
01:12:54.741 --> 01:12:58.490
He boarded into it and created one of the greatest facilities on the planet

2779
01:12:58.491 --> 01:12:59.390
earth for MMA,

2780
01:12:59.391 --> 01:13:00.440
especially the new place.

2781
01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.570
It's saying he's great too mean.

2782
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:03.901
But,

2783
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:04.020
uh,

2784
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:04.853
as a coach,

2785
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.510
what I really respect about Duke is not just the fact that he's got this

2786
01:13:08.511 --> 01:13:09.680
incredible wealth of knowledge,

2787
01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:10.790
but that he's so humble.

2788
01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.070
He's so like down to earth and chill.

2789
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.110
<v 1>GSR are the people,</v>

2790
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:16.440
the people that really just know it.

2791
01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:17.380
They don't have to prove it.

2792
01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.610
Days like that.

2793
01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:19.510
Duke's like that.

2794
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:20.230
Um,

2795
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.220
Lammers like that.

2796
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.230
Some guys had overly want to show you and stuff.

2797
01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:26.830
Those are the people that are kind of insecure or where they add as cautious

2798
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:27.650
striking coach you,

2799
01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:28.620
I mean you shared was writing coach,

2800
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:30.040
she's all why you train with that guy?

2801
01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:31.420
They like get so sensitive.

2802
01:13:31.421 --> 01:13:32.590
I'm never seen it before.

2803
01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.150
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2804
01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:34.230
So I just,

2805
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.220
I just don't like to deal with it.

2806
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.241
Yeah,

2807
01:13:36.241 --> 01:13:37.110
it's unfortunate.

2808
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.610
It's not my boxing coach like that too.

2809
01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:43.530
Eric Brown for wild and I've been training with him since 2007 2008 so he's the

2810
01:13:43.531 --> 01:13:44.364
same way.

2811
01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:46.140
So now when you're out here,

2812
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:48.810
like sometimes you're home and when you're home,

2813
01:13:48.811 --> 01:13:49.890
what kind of stuff do you do?

2814
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:51.030
Like if you're not injured,

2815
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.130
if you're not recovering from a surgery,

2816
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:53.611
like what,

2817
01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:55.950
what stuff do you do at home and hang out with my kids.

2818
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:57.300
Go to football practice,

2819
01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:58.410
go to the practice,

2820
01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.850
take everybody to school,

2821
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:00.810
pick everybody up.

2822
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:02.220
Play video games.

2823
01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:03.270
She went about like training.

2824
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.710
I don't train.

2825
01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.300
You don't train it home sometimes.

2826
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:06.990
Not much.

2827
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.440
Really?

2828
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.230
Yeah.

2829
01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:09.063
You don't do anything?

2830
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:09.721
I do.

2831
01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:11.910
Shouldn't the condition it with my God dairy,

2832
01:14:11.911 --> 01:14:12.610
Fairchild

2833
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:13.443
<v 1>and um,</v>

2834
01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:14.000
I got a,

2835
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.450
I got a up and coming,

2836
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:15.940
um,

2837
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.511
featherweight.

2838
01:14:16.511 --> 01:14:19.990
There's really fast and good boxing so I play around with him a little bit.

2839
01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:20.551
I might run,

2840
01:14:20.551 --> 01:14:21.251
I might hit the bag,

2841
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:22.210
might do the versaclimber,

2842
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:23.580
but when this camp time,

2843
01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:24.414
my mouth,

2844
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.600
when it's not camp time,

2845
01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.773
I'm both family.

2846
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.671
That's interesting.

2847
01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.600
So you don't,

2848
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.370
you're not constantly training?

2849
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.383
No.

2850
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:32.530
Wow.

2851
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:33.220
That's you.

2852
01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.870
Do you feel like that used to,

2853
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:39.340
you used to watch change that because I stopped like MMA.

2854
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:39.851
Ah,

2855
01:14:39.851 --> 01:14:40.240
okay.

2856
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.390
So now you feel like you were kind of burnt out but I never started watching.

2857
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:44.380
I'm always watching film.

2858
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:46.180
I'm always in my obviously working on Fox.

2859
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:47.440
I got a break everybody down.

2860
01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.910
I wasn't burnt out.

2861
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:49.744
I just,

2862
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.000
I want to want to miss this shit.

2863
01:14:52.001 --> 01:14:53.380
I want to want to get back in there.

2864
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:54.900
I want to hear somebody named,

2865
01:14:54.901 --> 01:14:58.660
they fighting me and I want to get nervous a little bit and watch some film and

2866
01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.660
see what they do well and then let's get this done.

2867
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:02.441
Let's get this together.

2868
01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:03.520
Let's write everything out.

2869
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.230
Let's map out the training camp,

2870
01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:06.460
let's get our partners,

2871
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:08.590
let's do what we need to do and let's get after it.

2872
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:08.951
And that,

2873
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:12.780
that takes away the pressure from me right now with,

2874
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.750
with his injury.

2875
01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:15.220
And the fact that three months in,

2876
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:17.350
you should be able to probably start training hard.

2877
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:17.921
What do you,

2878
01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:19.450
when you look in to defend the belt again?

2879
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:20.291
You know,

2880
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:21.520
I can probably,

2881
01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.570
I will probably fight,

2882
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:24.190
um,

2883
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:25.390
April will be kind of pushing it,

2884
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:28.750
but may June,

2885
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.760
July is use the card big July 4th car.

2886
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:31.594
I shut away today.

2887
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:32.740
That's a good one.

2888
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:32.970
Yeah,

2889
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:33.130
right.

2890
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:33.401
By the way,

2891
01:15:33.401 --> 01:15:34.060
today,

2892
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:39.060
and that's probably like more [inaudible] Saint Pierre fighting main event,

2893
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:40.721
July,

2894
01:15:40.721 --> 01:15:41.950
whatever the hell we can.

2895
01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:44.140
July 4th weekend I used to be the international fight.

2896
01:15:44.141 --> 01:15:44.470
Yeah,

2897
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.490
that's the bell would be,

2898
01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:45.791
I mean,

2899
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.610
that's why I have the biggest chance to get a big fight.

2900
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.260
That's what I want.

2901
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.270
If I was your manager saying that's what we got to do.

2902
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.041
So it was July,

2903
01:15:51.041 --> 01:15:52.040
probably hanging in the man.

2904
01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:53.170
It's no fight in between it.

2905
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:54.400
That's going to make sense for me to do.

2906
01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.231
As George said,

2907
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:57.130
he's retired or he's not retired.

2908
01:15:57.131 --> 01:15:57.641
What did they do?

2909
01:15:57.641 --> 01:15:58.960
Just just gave up the belt.

2910
01:15:59.000 --> 01:15:59.470
Right?

2911
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:00.850
George?

2912
01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.420
I don't want to speak for George because I liked yours.

2913
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:05.283
I liked them too,

2914
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.430
so I don't want to speak for him.

2915
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.420
But George is just smart.

2916
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.643
He's,

2917
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.250
he,

2918
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.500
he plays the fact that he don't,

2919
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:11.861
oh,

2920
01:16:11.861 --> 01:16:13.160
I don't really speak English that well.

2921
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:14.231
Mother fucking smart.

2922
01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:15.064
He know what he done.

2923
01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.200
There's been wasn't right fight.

2924
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:17.651
Okay.

2925
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:18.484
Think about it.

2926
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:22.660
Biz mean according to all the middle ways wasn't really the best middleweight

2927
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:23.621
they all,

2928
01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:28.621
everybody wanted to fight Bisbing so if George is gonna go up fighting for

2929
01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:29.734
another belt,

2930
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.210
another legendary move,

2931
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.990
fight a guy that does not have the punching power,

2932
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.610
maybe cannot take him down.

2933
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.080
Maybe we can not stop to take down.

2934
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.110
And for once George probably had a power punch,

2935
01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:42.550
a power advantage against Bisbee.

2936
01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:44.590
So with that said,

2937
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.660
it made a lot of sense for him to do that.

2938
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:48.520
They also had a lot of history training together.

2939
01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:49.810
That was a big part of it.

2940
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.430
Yeah.

2941
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:51.370
And George's eyes.

2942
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.630
He was very successful again,

2943
01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:53.831
you know he was,

2944
01:16:53.831 --> 01:16:55.420
he was kind of worried about the size though.

2945
01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:56.980
Yeah.

2946
01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.790
He came and he was like,

2947
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:58.061
hey,

2948
01:16:58.061 --> 01:16:59.290
so how much do you think gives me way?

2949
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:00.080
I'm like,

2950
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.300
are you fucking serious?

2951
01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.770
He was like really worried about that.

2952
01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.040
There was talk about you fighting Bisbing at one time.

2953
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:07.540
I know you guys got with it.

2954
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.530
We got back like two or five right now.

2955
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:10.100
I'm good.

2956
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.510
<v 3>I'm good to find a middle way.</v>

2957
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.960
I actually offered to fight George had middleweight and give up my belt at

2958
01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.470
welterweight and just fight him.

2959
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:20.990
If I lose the fucking middleweight title,

2960
01:17:20.991 --> 01:17:23.570
then I lost my belt and now I'm fucking Sam Sausage Cheddar,

2961
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:24.560
you know,

2962
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.470
I guess don't till the bottom of the bottom of the day,

2963
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.350
but when you make that kind of ballsy say,

2964
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:30.591
Hey,

2965
01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:32.450
I'll fight him at little weight and I would give my building.

2966
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.950
It's that fight doesn't happen.

2967
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:37.770
At that point I kind of feel like somebody might not want to mind.

2968
01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.200
Well,

2969
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.011
it's hard to say,

2970
01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:44.780
right because the only fought once in four years and there's no timetable and

2971
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:47.030
his return and no thought whatsoever.

2972
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.490
There's a lot of weirdness in this sport right now.

2973
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:54.510
It's so much rests on January 20th so much restaurant in Gando versus steep at,

2974
01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.980
because I think that fight is going to be gigantic for the sport.

2975
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.230
It's going to be gigantic for the sport and then you know,

2976
01:18:00.231 --> 01:18:03.370
I think Steve pay his use of overly working in the over,

2977
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:03.741
you know what I mean?

2978
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:04.160
He,

2979
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.300
he had the spot where he was like,

2980
01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:05.511
man,

2981
01:18:05.511 --> 01:18:06.760
when am I ever going get my shot?

2982
01:18:06.761 --> 01:18:07.860
And they finally got it took,

2983
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.840
it took advantage of it and I was in a similar situation.

2984
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:11.091
I was like,

2985
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:12.010
when am I going to get my shot?

2986
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.321
Got It.

2987
01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:15.020
Took advantage of it and Gyno has very scary.

2988
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:16.300
It's so scared.

2989
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.720
He know,

2990
01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.930
knock you out regular.

2991
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.733
That's the thing.

2992
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:21.080
You will hit you and you fall out.

2993
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:22.280
He hit you and everybody,

2994
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:25.780
oh sh they wondering if you alive still and it's kind of like,

2995
01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.200
like what he hit,

2996
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.600
he hit ovary.

2997
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:29.380
Oh my God.

2998
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.620
Do you see the mean when it was like the,

2999
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:33.170
like the Pez candy in his head,

3000
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:33.801
his head,

3001
01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.450
his back of his head almost touch the spine.

3002
01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.890
That was an insane knock out.

3003
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:37.131
Yeah,

3004
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:37.964
he knocked him down.

3005
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.640
He's freaky in his speed.

3006
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:42.950
His power and his story's incredible.

3007
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:46.760
I mean you want to talk about a story that's like right out of a movie.

3008
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:51.260
Guy was homeless five years ago and now all of a sudden in two years of

3009
01:18:51.261 --> 01:18:51.520
fighting,

3010
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.240
so appreciative and so happy,

3011
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:54.074
you know,

3012
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.560
fucking hands with like two times the size of my hand.

3013
01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.690
You say you're shake his head before feels weird.

3014
01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:01.490
Like you hook like you're shaking a loaf of bread.

3015
01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:02.571
I'm like,

3016
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:03.404
Damn.

3017
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.510
I told his boxing coach,

3018
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.821
I'm like,

3019
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:05.001
man,

3020
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:06.350
I do not envy you man.

3021
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.200
You get punched in their body protected.

3022
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:08.920
I know that shit hurt.

3023
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.171
He said,

3024
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:09.770
no.

3025
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:10.070
He said,

3026
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.581
you can put it on.

3027
01:19:10.581 --> 01:19:10.820
I said,

3028
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:11.091
no,

3029
01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:13.800
I will not tell them no,

3030
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.160
no,

3031
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.120
not about that life.

3032
01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.380
He is something special.

3033
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:19.260
The real world.

3034
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.910
If I was Steve Bay,

3035
01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.761
I was walking down,

3036
01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:23.594
but he ain't going down.

3037
01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.453
It's going to try.

3038
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.610
See if they got a good chin,

3039
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.260
but I wouldn't test it against him.

3040
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:27.771
No,

3041
01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:28.350
don't tell him.

3042
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:31.040
I think he's going to try to close the distance and grabbed him and tried to

3043
01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:31.271
drag.

3044
01:19:31.271 --> 01:19:32.760
I think he should but I don't think he is.

3045
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.630
You don't think it's going to be able to?

3046
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:34.880
I think he wanted to show everybody.

3047
01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:36.350
I stood up with Overeem.

3048
01:19:36.351 --> 01:19:37.390
I sit over the um,

3049
01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.360
um,

3050
01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.081
jds.

3051
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:40.760
I stood over for ratio.

3052
01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:41.301
I sit over all,

3053
01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:42.170
all these guys.

3054
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:43.330
Totally different thing.

3055
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:43.551
Right?

3056
01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:43.940
Nelson,

3057
01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:44.331
I know,

3058
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:46.700
I know that wholly defined on his coaching staff.

3059
01:19:46.701 --> 01:19:49.850
I don't know what they think and I think he should punch the take downs,

3060
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:52.820
take down on the ground and pound where his arms out and make,

3061
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:56.450
make Ingando fight him to stop getting takedown and see if you can take some

3062
01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:57.530
steam off them hands.

3063
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:58.550
That's what I think too.

3064
01:19:58.551 --> 01:20:01.100
And I think that the clinic is going to be critical over him.

3065
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:02.990
Got The clinch on him but couldn't do anything with it.

3066
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.600
And Stevie was college wrestler Steve Pay.

3067
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:07.040
It's got good wrestling skills.

3068
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:07.741
You know,

3069
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:07.961
he's,

3070
01:20:07.961 --> 01:20:11.070
he's known more as being an overall well rounded MMA fighter,

3071
01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:12.660
but I think he's got to get that clinch.

3072
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.570
I just think standing in front of in Ghana is just,

3073
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:16.890
you're just,

3074
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.390
you're playing Russian roulette.

3075
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:23.450
One of those bullets is going to land in front of them and not even just in the,

3076
01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.500
even if we do an appearance,

3077
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:25.751
I'm going to,

3078
01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:26.040
hey,

3079
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.320
you too close to Miu Miu yo big ass over there.

3080
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:29.090
Ooh,

3081
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.923
Bingo.

3082
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.100
When he connects it's just,

3083
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:33.060
it's something different.

3084
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:35.210
So people always ask me that.

3085
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.300
Do you think they want in Gando to when do you think they are trying to set this

3086
01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.140
up so he can win?

3087
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.260
Do you think like as far as asset,

3088
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.210
he's an amazing story.

3089
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:48.620
If he was the champion it would be very marketable and I don't want,

3090
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:49.561
yeah,

3091
01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:51.870
I mean I don't know a firefighter with the raspy voice.

3092
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.920
I don't think there's,

3093
01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.440
I think if Steve Bay can turn Francis back,

3094
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:56.130
that's,

3095
01:20:56.130 --> 01:21:00.620
that's very marketable to I think the UDP lands he does when he gets to the,

3096
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.651
he broke the record,

3097
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:02.250
right?

3098
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:02.700
Yeah.

3099
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.840
He will break the record,

3100
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.240
which is crazy,

3101
01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.073
but defenses.

3102
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.640
I know that's how crazy the heavyweight division is and always has been.

3103
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:09.391
You know,

3104
01:21:09.391 --> 01:21:09.850
all you,

3105
01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:11.950
the most anyone has ever done is Kane.

3106
01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:13.020
Kane's done two defenses.

3107
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:13.500
Right?

3108
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.190
Damn,

3109
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:14.720
that's crazy.

3110
01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.000
Cane,

3111
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:15.241
right?

3112
01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:16.000
Cain hold the,

3113
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.250
the,

3114
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:17.370
the office cane

3115
01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:19.930
and pork.

3116
01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:23.100
Kane Cain has so many injuries,

3117
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:23.460
man.

3118
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.080
It's just constantly injured.

3119
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:27.030
That poor guy is constantly getting surgery.

3120
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:28.750
Did he freaking my,

3121
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.060
I know my man over there,

3122
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:31.790
he's checking.

3123
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:32.880
I thought she had a St Louis Hat.

3124
01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.770
I used to like to get some,

3125
01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:35.340
some stripes over there.

3126
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.250
Now that La la and it's from Ohio.

3127
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:41.400
Columbus,

3128
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.710
Columbus are cold as hell out there.

3129
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:45.090
Fuck out is,

3130
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:46.830
I was just out in Canton not too long ago.

3131
01:21:46.831 --> 01:21:49.100
My son played in the hall of fame,

3132
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:53.730
who I know UFC champion has defended the belt more than twice heavyweight

3133
01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:54.390
champion.

3134
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:55.223
So what does it say?

3135
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:55.801
Does it say,

3136
01:21:55.801 --> 01:21:56.220
um,

3137
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.330
whether it's Cain,

3138
01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.130
Cain,

3139
01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:00.120
Cain Velasquez?

3140
01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.413
Yeah.

3141
01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.083
This is a while ago.

3142
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.900
Yeah.

3143
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:04.650
I think I'm,

3144
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.530
Steve Bay is the version that came with less injuries.

3145
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.850
Can't kicks a little bit more,

3146
01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:09.481
but you know,

3147
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:12.130
just pressure Punchin um,

3148
01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:12.900
endurance.

3149
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.560
Yeah.

3150
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.070
Yeah.

3151
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.000
Cause he plays the bass.

3152
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.380
He's definitely a beast.

3153
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:16.711
Look,

3154
01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:18.330
this is going to be the toughest fight for sure.

3155
01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:19.290
And in Ganas career,

3156
01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.550
but what's,

3157
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:22.590
what's it mean if Steve Bay can win?

3158
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.850
It's amazing and it solidifies his position as the baddest man on the planet.

3159
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.300
But there's something about in Ghana that is,

3160
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:32.940
it's uh,

3161
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:34.140
it's more,

3162
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.200
it's more enticing to people.

3163
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:41.670
It's also the fact that Steve pay has been in so many wars and his chin has been

3164
01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:42.780
touched a lot of times.

3165
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.050
Yeah.

3166
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:47.010
So he has a great Chin but you don't want to keep testing it.

3167
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.130
So she gets to do nick and Ghana would awkward power.

3168
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:50.870
Yeah.

3169
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:55.460
The five round junior dos Santos fight was crazy long fight and he got knocked

3170
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:58.260
down who would go for a marine down.

3171
01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.570
So it's a tough one.

3172
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:01.730
But the thing is like we,

3173
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:04.230
we know so little about in Gannon was ground game.

3174
01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:05.890
We know so little about his,

3175
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:07.990
his ability to overcome adversity.

3176
01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:08.250
Yeah.

3177
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:09.580
He's just been smashing people.

3178
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.060
Yeah,

3179
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:10.511
I agree.

3180
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:10.950
I said that.

3181
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:11.860
I said that out of the day.

3182
01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:14.260
I think that Steve Hayes been in a tough fights.

3183
01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:16.180
He's been knocked down and he's,

3184
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.360
he's on a five,

3185
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:18.060
five,

3186
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.510
five k I'll shrink as well,

3187
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:20.141
like,

3188
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:20.974
you know what I mean?

3189
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:23.620
And it's against tougher opponents in Ghana was knocked out.

3190
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.130
Well,

3191
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:26.890
the sport is so exciting right now,

3192
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:27.131
man.

3193
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:28.270
There's so much talent.

3194
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:29.890
Who's your favorite fighters going on?

3195
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.873
Tyron Woodley.

3196
01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.170
It wouldn't happen to be because I'm here.

3197
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:37.000
I don't have a favorite fighter.

3198
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:38.080
Max Holloway smashing.

3199
01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:38.191
Right.

3200
01:23:38.191 --> 01:23:39.040
And I love Max.

3201
01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:42.140
I like his style too because his style is uh,

3202
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.230
he overwhelms you.

3203
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.840
He doesn't,

3204
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.800
he's not knocking anybody.

3205
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:45.600
I was one shot.

3206
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.910
He's just constantly overwhelming you with conditioning and intelligence and

3207
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:51.190
timing and distance and he could do everything.

3208
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.350
He could strike you,

3209
01:23:52.351 --> 01:23:53.260
take you to the ground.

3210
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.370
He's got a great defense.

3211
01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:57.670
Take taken submissions are outstanding and I liked that fight with him and

3212
01:23:57.671 --> 01:23:58.361
Frankie Edgar.

3213
01:23:58.361 --> 01:23:59.390
That's an interesting fight.

3214
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:00.820
I was just talking about this other day,

3215
01:24:00.821 --> 01:24:01.450
but I'm,

3216
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.940
Frankie Edgar has fought similar,

3217
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.300
you know,

3218
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.270
cub Swanson or Yoyo Rodriguez.

3219
01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:11.050
But Max isn't really fought anybody like,

3220
01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:14.770
like Frankie before somebody has short and compact that knows how to get close

3221
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:15.011
quick,

3222
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:16.030
knows how to get out quick.

3223
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.230
He'll take it out.

3224
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:17.621
Frankly,

3225
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:18.100
don't give it here.

3226
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:18.760
He was taken out.

3227
01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.330
Um,

3228
01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:20.560
who was at Charlie [inaudible]?

3229
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.450
He didn't give me hell how great he was on the ground.

3230
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:24.700
He was in his car punching and I think,

3231
01:24:24.701 --> 01:24:25.534
um,

3232
01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.920
that can present some problems.

3233
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:27.100
Yeah,

3234
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:27.630
absolutely.

3235
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.450
Just to go fight the good fight.

3236
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:30.040
Yeah.

3237
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.180
That's the March 3rd fight.

3238
01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:32.020
And um,

3239
01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.010
Max is a big,

3240
01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:34.330
big favorite in that fight,

3241
01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:35.980
which I thought was functioning tall too.

3242
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:37.540
He looks like he's in my weight.

3243
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.231
Yeah.

3244
01:24:38.231 --> 01:24:39.070
He's tall.

3245
01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:43.150
Confident in the Aldo fight,

3246
01:24:43.151 --> 01:24:44.620
especially the second fight man.

3247
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.780
You see that confidence just oozing out of him.

3248
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:47.740
He's the champion.

3249
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.540
He's a beast.

3250
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:49.360
Yeah.

3251
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.360
I think 55 is an amazing way in class right now.

3252
01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.560
We argue on Fox that they think they tried to get under my skin and say

3253
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.570
lightweight is the best divisional said,

3254
01:24:58.571 --> 01:24:59.404
don't play with me.

3255
01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:00.020
Well,

3256
01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:00.853
two ways.

3257
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:03.880
After a beep,

3258
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.120
yeah.

3259
01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.160
Be was a beast.

3260
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.780
I haven't watched any of his fights.

3261
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:08.840
I watched him.

3262
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.940
I said I need to go back to my,

3263
01:25:09.941 --> 01:25:10.390
um,

3264
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:11.140
my math.

3265
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.370
He fights like that every time.

3266
01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:13.330
Yeah,

3267
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:14.163
he's a monster.

3268
01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.060
You see the Michael Johnson fight,

3269
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.530
he's telling me to give up.

3270
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:18.220
I saw that clear.

3271
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:19.210
It must be jump,

3272
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:19.990
give up,

3273
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.750
smashing his wrestling and his,

3274
01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:23.470
his,

3275
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:24.460
his ground and pound.

3276
01:25:24.461 --> 01:25:25.630
It's just so ferocious.

3277
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:27.040
It's just on such another level.

3278
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.900
And when he gets ahold of guys,

3279
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.350
he's getting ahold of guys that are really good and just rag on him.

3280
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:34.580
Like what he did the Rda Gypsy that fine.

3281
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:34.960
Yeah,

3282
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.560
I saw,

3283
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.580
I haven't seen those fights.

3284
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:37.450
I got to go back and look.

3285
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.630
Ragdolled Rda.

3286
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:40.630
It's just beats the shit out of people.

3287
01:25:40.631 --> 01:25:41.530
It gets you to the ground.

3288
01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:42.430
I was a big fan after that.

3289
01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:42.701
I'm like,

3290
01:25:42.701 --> 01:25:43.534
man,

3291
01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:45.280
he's something special dudes.

3292
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:46.360
He's something special.

3293
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:50.800
And the fact that he did that to Barboza he wants to move up to 72 shit.

3294
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:50.921
No,

3295
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:51.754
he don't.

3296
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:53.163
Hey,

3297
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.020
metabolic meals shit out and sit in and see my man.

3298
01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:56.950
He'll be by the pack.

3299
01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.220
Um,

3300
01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:58.830
nutrition.

3301
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:00.310
Is anybody out there?

3302
01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.460
I'm picking up the tab cycle as down there.

3303
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.830
55 I'm not trying to see,

3304
01:26:06.831 --> 01:26:06.981
no,

3305
01:26:06.981 --> 01:26:07.880
it could be right now.

3306
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.270
He's making 55 easy now though.

3307
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:12.410
So who knows?

3308
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:16.640
I think what I believe is going to happen is I think Connor's going to vacate.

3309
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:19.790
I think they're gonna strip him because Connor has got $100 million in the bank

3310
01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.300
and I think he's having fun and talking shit and he's going to keep training and

3311
01:26:23.301 --> 01:26:24.860
he's gonna make a big fight in the future.

3312
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:28.580
But I think Khabib versus Tony is the big fight and fuck.

3313
01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:30.110
They might even do that one on Russia,

3314
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:30.980
but they do that.

3315
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.780
What they're talking about doing big fight in Russia that,

3316
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.281
yeah,

3317
01:26:34.281 --> 01:26:35.120
if that happens,

3318
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:36.410
that's a good fight.

3319
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:36.771
I mean,

3320
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:38.330
everybody's been waiting to see that fight.

3321
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:38.931
Fuck yeah,

3322
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:39.561
that's a good fun.

3323
01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.690
It's like Tony Ferguson.

3324
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:43.040
Very Unorthodox.

3325
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.641
How many wins?

3326
01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.110
He's got like nine or 10 in a row.

3327
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:45.471
Yeah.

3328
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:48.350
He has a the most ever in the lightweight division,

3329
01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:51.830
and I think it's at 10 I think when he beat Kevin,

3330
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.180
it was at 10 Oh,

3331
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:54.020
who do you lose with?

3332
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:54.200
No,

3333
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.033
Michael Johnson.

3334
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.950
He loves to,

3335
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:58.700
boy,

3336
01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.650
you gotta go way back.

3337
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.130
He lost him a long time.

3338
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.870
Maybe it was my first backhoe.

3339
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:06.330
I mean Tony.

3340
01:27:06.331 --> 01:27:09.470
So Unorthodox and all the closer and against heave to Alcorn or at you for that

3341
01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:10.271
fight was a close one.

3342
01:27:10.271 --> 01:27:11.091
And he but man,

3343
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:11.740
yeah,

3344
01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.151
he,

3345
01:27:12.151 --> 01:27:13.220
he just um,

3346
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:17.930
nobody has told Tony at what he's doing is not who's Jamie?

3347
01:27:17.931 --> 01:27:18.650
Tony.

3348
01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:18.980
He's a,

3349
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.870
he lost a Jamie Tony earlier in his career.

3350
01:27:20.871 --> 01:27:21.620
It was curled up.

3351
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.540
What does that from a national fine lines.

3352
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.393
<v 4>Interesting.</v>

3353
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.750
<v 3>The Hyatt regency.</v>

3354
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.141
Oh,

3355
01:27:28.141 --> 01:27:29.130
Karen Davidian.

3356
01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.280
That guy's a very good fucking submission artist.

3357
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:34.343
<v 4>Interesting.</v>

3358
01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.653
Yeah.

3359
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:37.600
<v 3>Well he ain't OLED nine.</v>

3360
01:27:37.601 --> 01:27:39.850
Tim have a good habits his then ah,

3361
01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.090
<v 4>punch Cho Cho,</v>

3362
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.370
Cho Cho choke.

3363
01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:45.250
<v 3>Yup.</v>

3364
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:50.020
And Ron and Ron and over guys to the Edson Barboza fight was fucking fantastic.

3365
01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:52.170
That was a fantastic loaded if I too,

3366
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:52.560
I remember.

3367
01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.190
Yeah.

3368
01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:53.500
Well,

3369
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.180
and that's the danger about by Tony.

3370
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:57.940
It don't really matter if he's losing the fight the first,

3371
01:27:57.941 --> 01:27:58.870
the first or second round.

3372
01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.860
He keeps it together.

3373
01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:00.310
Yeah.

3374
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:01.143
Yeah.

3375
01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:01.961
He's in my end.

3376
01:28:01.961 --> 01:28:06.880
The dos Anjos fight was amazing to beat the shit out of dos Sandro's that's it.

3377
01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:07.450
I mean,

3378
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:08.800
he's a bad man.

3379
01:28:08.801 --> 01:28:09.640
Tony Ferguson,

3380
01:28:09.670 --> 01:28:11.530
you cannot sleep on Tony Ferguson.

3381
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.300
I used to fight is amazing.

3382
01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.201
I used to be like,

3383
01:28:14.201 --> 01:28:14.531
man,

3384
01:28:14.531 --> 01:28:18.490
this dude striking don't look like it's something that should frighten me that

3385
01:28:18.491 --> 01:28:18.731
much.

3386
01:28:18.731 --> 01:28:21.370
But when it's coming so often it's so weird angles.

3387
01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:23.410
And then he's going for shots and he's,

3388
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:27.040
he does the exact opposite of what you think you should do and grappling.

3389
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:29.680
And then he's in the position and then we'd get there.

3390
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:31.840
Now he's got like five or six schools for that position.

3391
01:28:31.841 --> 01:28:33.880
So he's like switching to here and there and there for,

3392
01:28:33.881 --> 01:28:34.151
you know,

3393
01:28:34.151 --> 01:28:35.410
y'all ass shot chucked out.

3394
01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:35.891
Yeah,

3395
01:28:35.891 --> 01:28:36.281
he's,

3396
01:28:36.281 --> 01:28:37.114
he's,

3397
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:38.860
he's the real deal.

3398
01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.281
That's a,

3399
01:28:39.281 --> 01:28:40.240
that's an amazing fight.

3400
01:28:40.241 --> 01:28:41.074
I love that fight.

3401
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:42.940
You know what I'm really interested in right now?

3402
01:28:42.941 --> 01:28:43.700
I'm really insistent.

3403
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:45.550
TJ Dillashaw versus mighty mouse.

3404
01:28:45.551 --> 01:28:46.780
There's so much talking about that.

3405
01:28:46.781 --> 01:28:47.231
I don't know.

3406
01:28:47.231 --> 01:28:48.190
I want to see it though.

3407
01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.850
Someone's got challenged and I don't see 'em Garber and money mouth.

3408
01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:52.500
Really?

3409
01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:52.760
Yeah.

3410
01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.201
I don't know why.

3411
01:28:53.201 --> 01:28:53.920
It just looks,

3412
01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.330
it looked on paper like I'm more interested in fight dom.

3413
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.661
Man,

3414
01:28:58.661 --> 01:28:59.410
I disagree.

3415
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:01.030
I think it's more interesting to see TJ.

3416
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.010
Tj has got more

3417
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.810
<v 2>weapons like TJ does more stuff,</v>

3418
01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.800
throws more kicks.

3419
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:05.850
He's got more,

3420
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:07.440
I mean you saw it in the guard band fight.

3421
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:08.070
That's where he heard him.

3422
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.903
You heard him when the head

3423
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:09.380
<v 1>I just,</v>

3424
01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.840
I just like Cody's boxing in the pocket.

3425
01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:13.010
In his counters.

3426
01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:13.400
Yeah.

3427
01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.730
Anybody that's going to deal with Dj sp kind of big Dj miss and not very many

3428
01:29:16.731 --> 01:29:17.710
people who have been able to write.

3429
01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.050
So my think tank,

3430
01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:20.270
they both are going to be tough fights.

3431
01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:21.140
I mean it's going to be tough for,

3432
01:29:21.141 --> 01:29:23.990
Tj is going to be tough for Dillashaw mighty mouse.

3433
01:29:23.991 --> 01:29:25.700
He just has very few holes.

3434
01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:27.910
He's like pouring water is moving.

3435
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:29.960
Just keep going to saying he never stopped.

3436
01:29:29.961 --> 01:29:30.171
I'm like,

3437
01:29:30.171 --> 01:29:31.004
Damn Dude,

3438
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:32.390
I got to watch them drill.

3439
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:33.630
We've raised fight.

3440
01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:36.320
Well I can do the same thing in the drill.

3441
01:29:36.321 --> 01:29:37.730
He just did it right in a fight.

3442
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:38.210
Right?

3443
01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:39.043
Dang.

3444
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.980
Now he's special.

3445
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.131
<v 2>Special.</v>

3446
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:41.401
His,

3447
01:29:41.401 --> 01:29:44.040
his ability and his ability to not get hit.

3448
01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.010
He's,

3449
01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:45.820
he's doing something

3450
01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:46.160
<v 1>then that's,</v>

3451
01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.590
he always thinks in dementia.

3452
01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.470
So like he was trying to take down Dotson,

3453
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.810
remember in Dotson,

3454
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.820
wanted them taken out and he said,

3455
01:29:51.821 --> 01:29:52.181
forget it,

3456
01:29:52.181 --> 01:29:54.450
I'm going to grab the leg and I'm a keep punching him in the face where elbowing

3457
01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.210
him in head.

3458
01:29:55.210 --> 01:29:56.980
And then finally he got to take now he just,

3459
01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.570
if he thinks is smart,

3460
01:29:58.900 --> 01:29:59.770
he's going to keep going.

3461
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.341
Excuse me.

3462
01:30:00.341 --> 01:30:01.220
He's not going to get discouraged.

3463
01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:02.021
You're gonna keep going for it.

3464
01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:04.090
If he was going to get Tom who was a kid,

3465
01:30:04.091 --> 01:30:04.360
um,

3466
01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.040
Tim Elliot,

3467
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:05.940
they had them in those days.

3468
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.400
Chokes.

3469
01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.120
I'm like,

3470
01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.380
I was freaking out cause you know,

3471
01:30:08.381 --> 01:30:09.100
Dj Mohammad,

3472
01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:09.341
I'm like,

3473
01:30:09.341 --> 01:30:09.910
man,

3474
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:11.290
is he about to loosen this kid?

3475
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:12.120
And he said,

3476
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:12.850
I'm good.

3477
01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:13.750
He had me in her deep,

3478
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.760
like he just don't get ride over.

3479
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:16.683
Oh no

3480
01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.141
<v 2>rattled.</v>

3481
01:30:17.141 --> 01:30:18.310
He's got the whole package.

3482
01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:19.510
She's got mental toughness.

3483
01:30:19.511 --> 01:30:20.410
He's intelligent.

3484
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:22.690
His skill levels on another level.

3485
01:30:22.691 --> 01:30:23.524
I mean it's,

3486
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.880
his skill level is off the charts.

3487
01:30:24.881 --> 01:30:25.714
He does everything.

3488
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.060
<v 1>He's a master at the shrine basics like that.</v>

3489
01:30:29.061 --> 01:30:29.420
That's,

3490
01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.150
um,

3491
01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:30.470
um,

3492
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:31.840
lift up return on bar,

3493
01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.770
maybe one of the flashy name did you ever seen him do?

3494
01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:34.761
But in general,

3495
01:30:34.761 --> 01:30:35.660
if you think about it,

3496
01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:39.800
he comes forward and he does great fast basics from this side.

3497
01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.380
He sort of stands great pass Bates from that side,

3498
01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.760
very traditional clinch,

3499
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:45.140
super active with it.

3500
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:45.740
Um,

3501
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.760
hard to take down,

3502
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:48.050
gets up to regular way.

3503
01:30:48.051 --> 01:30:48.401
If he,

3504
01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:49.234
he'd mount shoot,

3505
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:53.090
he believes like if of course teaches you or arm bar from the mouth and his

3506
01:30:53.091 --> 01:30:53.600
mind,

3507
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.220
it's 100% chance it's gonna work.

3508
01:30:55.221 --> 01:30:56.390
There's no way it can't work.

3509
01:30:56.570 --> 01:31:00.680
So when you see him go do a regular arm bar on somebody and submit them like,

3510
01:31:00.681 --> 01:31:01.011
you know,

3511
01:31:01.011 --> 01:31:03.020
a whore or Gucci or John Moraga,

3512
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:03.501
he's like,

3513
01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:03.711
Damn,

3514
01:31:03.711 --> 01:31:04.860
how you hitting him with that one bar?

3515
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.120
Because he's just don't believe in the fact that doubt and his techniques.

3516
01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:09.800
So no,

3517
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:10.371
it's a,

3518
01:31:10.371 --> 01:31:11.630
it's an amazing time.

3519
01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.950
Amazing time for the sport.

3520
01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:14.360
And uh,

3521
01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:16.543
I mean

3522
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:18.120
<v 2>it's amazing time.</v>

3523
01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.040
It's just an amazing time for martial arts,

3524
01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:20.520
period.

3525
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:20.900
I mean,

3526
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:25.290
I think martial arts right now is at the highest level that it's ever been in

3527
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.060
the history of people fighting each other.

3528
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:27.541
<v 1>No,</v>

3529
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:27.921
it's,

3530
01:31:27.921 --> 01:31:32.921
it's a a siding moment as well because now you got so many different hopefuls.

3531
01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:33.330
No,

3532
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:36.790
we got six or seven people that they just need one more economy.

3533
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:37.950
We just need one more.

3534
01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:39.180
This person is just need one more.

3535
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:40.650
Then they jump off and it,

3536
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:40.891
you know,

3537
01:31:40.891 --> 01:31:42.180
to become superstar because we,

3538
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:44.430
we need more stars right now.

3539
01:31:44.431 --> 01:31:45.360
We got Connor,

3540
01:31:45.361 --> 01:31:47.460
but when this kind of going to come back,

3541
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.890
I think Rhonda may do to WWE thing.

3542
01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:50.701
Josh,

3543
01:31:50.701 --> 01:31:51.211
she's done.

3544
01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:54.030
I'm pretty sure I figure WLV thing is a,

3545
01:31:54.031 --> 01:31:54.721
as a good look.

3546
01:31:54.721 --> 01:31:55.421
I know she was at,

3547
01:31:55.421 --> 01:31:58.410
at like dinner with triple h and m and our agent,

3548
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.070
uh,

3549
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.561
Slater.

3550
01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:02.980
So I hope she does that man because people can say whatever they want.

3551
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:04.240
But Ronda Rousey was,

3552
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.800
she was that girl at one point.

3553
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.100
She was and she put us all on the map in a different way.

3554
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.570
It had the old lady did the 75 year old lady at the airport talking about MMA.

3555
01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:13.920
So,

3556
01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:14.540
Yup.

3557
01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:14.850
She,

3558
01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:15.101
she,

3559
01:32:15.101 --> 01:32:16.210
she's a GG paid our,

3560
01:32:16.211 --> 01:32:16.960
do you know,

3561
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.110
I think if she want to gracefully walk into a different realm,

3562
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:21.790
WWE film I seen,

3563
01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.460
she's just produced some type of series that um,

3564
01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:24.701
you know,

3565
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:25.690
we should support her on that.

3566
01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:26.620
<v 3>I agree.</v>

3567
01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.890
I agree 100% and really don't want to see her fight again.

3568
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.720
I,

3569
01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.130
if she wants to fight again,

3570
01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.400
but what if I would,

3571
01:32:34.401 --> 01:32:39.401
I would want to see is her move to a camp that could address the entire game of

3572
01:32:40.181 --> 01:32:44.470
MMA in a much more comprehensive way and not tell her that she's great at

3573
01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:44.831
something.

3574
01:32:44.831 --> 01:32:45.401
If she's willing,

3575
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:47.800
I would want her to go to like Matt Hume or someone like that.

3576
01:32:47.801 --> 01:32:48.241
But who,

3577
01:32:48.241 --> 01:32:50.050
who is she actually fight?

3578
01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:51.450
She's two.

3579
01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:56.080
She's too big of a name to fight somebody who she's fighting fight someone who's

3580
01:32:56.081 --> 01:32:58.540
coming up fight someone get a tune up fight.

3581
01:32:58.541 --> 01:32:59.170
You had an actual,

3582
01:32:59.170 --> 01:32:59.471
I mean,

3583
01:32:59.471 --> 01:33:01.300
but I don't even think she wants to fight.

3584
01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:01.901
I mean,

3585
01:33:01.901 --> 01:33:04.210
I think at a certain point in time you have enough money in the bank,

3586
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:07.630
you have enough notoriety and fame and she's got a lot of aspirations outside of

3587
01:33:07.631 --> 01:33:08.440
the sport.

3588
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.640
She's married now.

3589
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:10.121
Who knows?

3590
01:33:10.121 --> 01:33:11.260
She might want to start a family.

3591
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:12.123
You right,

3592
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.173
you right.

3593
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:13.710
Listen,

3594
01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:18.190
all I want to see is George Saint Pierre versus was in July,

3595
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:22.450
July four I say because my big prediction for [inaudible] make it happen big.

3596
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:26.080
My big prediction for me is that I fight just any pair of my first fight back.

3597
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.990
I'd like to see,

3598
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:30.290
I showed us or I can hurt Katie.

3599
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.910
We'll pause.

3600
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:31.570
How do you sleep?

3601
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:32.321
I can't punch it.

3602
01:33:32.321 --> 01:33:33.400
Hard to sleep.

3603
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:34.810
I mean George is,

3604
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:35.711
if you want to fight me,

3605
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:35.981
brother,

3606
01:33:35.981 --> 01:33:38.950
this is the time and time Georgia get me George right now.

3607
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:40.420
Wake up money George.

3608
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:43.770
And what a fight that would be in terms of like,

3609
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:48.190
like just historical significance and how big it would be.

3610
01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:48.701
I mean,

3611
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:53.701
he's coming off of the win of his career coming back four years off beat Bisbing

3612
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:56.050
choke them unconscious for the title.

3613
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:58.830
Vacates the title steps right in their fights.

3614
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:59.860
You at one 70.

3615
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:00.340
He's a,

3616
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.150
Gee,

3617
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:01.950
it'd be fun.

3618
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:05.050
And he would exit the sport and nobody would give him that much stuff from

3619
01:34:05.051 --> 01:34:05.884
losing to me.

3620
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:08.921
Thanks for doing this,

3621
01:34:08.921 --> 01:34:09.221
man.

3622
01:34:09.221 --> 01:34:09.791
I appreciate it.

3623
01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:11.050
I'm glad we finally got in here.

3624
01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.110
So it did it.

3625
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.580
Uh,

3626
01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.031
tell people,

3627
01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:13.960

3628
01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:15.220

E.

3633
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.510
Y.

3634
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:19.343
