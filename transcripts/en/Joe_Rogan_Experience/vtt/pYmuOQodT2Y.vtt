1
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.280
Sweet.
Jesus.
We're back.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.630
This episode of the Joe Rogan parents podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.280
If you are thinking about getting a website built for you,

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.750
just before you do that,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.780
just try Squarespace because it's easy enough that a retard like myself,

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.980
politically incorrect term special needs.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.150
I think it's okay when you say everybody yourself.
Um,

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.800
it's not right if a nigger you can't write,
I don't know.
I don't think you can.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.600
Um,
you could probably,
you can't call yourself a fag.

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.480
Can you call yourself a client?
You can probably call yourself a cunt.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.040
I do it every morning.
That's not a problem.
Squarespace is.

12
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.030
What it essentially is,

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:44.031
is a website that's set up for you to make a website very easily and really nice

14
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.170
stuff.

15
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.690
They have over 20 badass designs and you can try it out without ever action.

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.360
Having to use any money entering any credit.
Our credit card information,

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.190
if you go to squarespace.com forward slash Joe just try it out and you could

18
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.340
build a website,
decided socks and do nothing.
You don't pay anything.

19
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.520
But if you like it,
and I think if you really are looking for a website,

20
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.130
you can make an awesome website.
Super easy.

21
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.090
Brian has made maybe a thousand websites now think he just,

22
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.650
he makes them while we're doing the show.

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.090
It's so fucking easy and you can set up like really cool shit.

24
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.790
Like you can have an online store and like 10 minutes.
It's,

25
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.080
the way they have it done is they've really taken all of the mystery out of

26
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.140
website development.
And if you choose to use it,

27
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.460
if you use the code Joe and then the number seven,

28
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.900
um,
you can save yourself some cash.
I think you saved 20 no,

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.970
10% I think it's 10% yeah,

30
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.860
<v 1>they're all the same.
But it's really cool cause it,</v>

31
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.370
the cool thing is is especially if you have just a basic website where you just

32
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.600
went like,
like a,
you own a store and you want your hours of operation.
Sure.
Your,

33
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:50.870
your store and your address and stuff.

34
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.510
You can easily make something like that real fast.

35
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.990
And if you wanted to get more in depth,
you can build a great website.

36
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.890
<v 0>Yeah,
you really,
you don't have to,</v>

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.810
you don't have to go anywhere anymore and you can do it yourself.

38
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.591
If you have the time,

39
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.410
you can definitely save some money and you get a satisfaction of building a

40
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.890
website yourself.
Use the code Joe and the number seven all together,

41
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:09.810
Joe Seven and you save 10% off.

42
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.780
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh and an rit if you go there

43
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.480
right now with the gorilla belt is common.
We a,

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.210
we almost have released the gorilla kettle bell.
The,
the,
um,
it's,

45
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.960
there's a,
there's a whole thing about it.
If you go to my Twitter page,

46
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.210
there's like,
um,
some sort of promotion from fucking silly thing,

47
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:33.420
but the grill of Bell's Badass,
it's 72 pounds.

48
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.790
If you're savage enough to flip that bitch around.
Is that what you use?
Uh,
yeah,

49
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:40.440
I use that one.
What is it guerrilla though?
It's a Kettlebell.

50
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.300
We made them in the shape of gorillas.
That's a chimpanzee one.

51
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.130
And we made one of the shape of grills.

52
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.160
All these people that have been asking about the Alpha brain test too.
Um,

53
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.850
I can give you the idea of what's going to be reported on that.

54
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.180
What they did was,
um,
we did a pilot test.

55
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.900
It was a double blind placebo test done by the strictest scientific standards

56
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.320
and um,
we had very positive results.

57
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.840
We're going to release all those results and let everybody know it will be

58
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.500
published and then we move into a larger longterm study.

59
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.700
The idea behind it is like I,

60
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.190
I put out this stuff with Aubrey and I talked to you guys about it and I

61
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.760
explained my history in nootropics and so many people called bullshit,

62
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.940
which is normal.
This is what human beings do and it's also good.

63
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.030
It's healthy to call bullshit because when you call bullshit,

64
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.530
that makes everybody back up their claims.

65
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.300
So it made us go out and do these double blind placebo studies showed mark

66
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.990
statistical improvements in memory and in cognitive function will explain the

67
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.840
whole thing.
It'll all be published.
And then we're going to move into a larger,

68
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:42.580
long,
long scale one.

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.970
And we might even come up with different formulations of Alpha brain.

70
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.670
But the bottom line is if you're interested in nootropics,

71
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.430
one of the best things about this company,
the way we have it set it up,

72
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.120
is you have a free money back guarantee.

73
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.620
You don't have to send in the product,
try it for 90 days.
He say,

74
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.580
this shit sucks.
First 90 pills or first 30 pills rather than you try,

75
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.570
try it.
You have 90 days to get your money back.
It's that simple.

76
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.450
If you don't like it,
you say it's not worth it.
Get your money back.

77
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.380
If you are interested in this stuff,
the first thing you should do,

78
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:18.370
if you're interested in vitamins,
it's such a pain in the ass to read books.
Okay?

79
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:20.800
It sucks,
but you really should.
You should really,

80
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.110
if you're going to take something,
you going to take supplements,

81
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
you should really find out about the different variables you should really feel

82
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:29.380
you're going to hear people say that some things are bad for you and then

83
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.660
another doctor will tell you that it's fucking awesome for you.
I mean,

84
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.970
the latest thing is they're saying that a fish oil,

85
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.980
it gives you cancer or it can promote cancer.
It's Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.440
Oh Jesus.
There's so it's fucked.
The world's terrifying.

87
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:42.850
Everything gives you cancer.
I don't,

88
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.570
I don't know if they're correct because rob wolf has a retort to that.

89
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.120
Who's the guy who wrote the Paleo Solution?
Brilliant Guy,
and I read his thing.

90
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.030
His thing makes a lot of sense.
So it's,
it's hard to understand,
but when you're,

91
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.530
if you're interested in nootropics,

92
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.500
if you're interested in anything like new mood,

93
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.790
which is a a five HTP supplement and l Tryptofan,
which converts to five HTP,

94
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.201
Redo some research,

95
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:09.940
just Google it and find out the pros and cons before you throw your body into

96
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.910
any sort of a supplementation routine.

97
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.360
But what we're trying to do it on it is give you all the shit that I use,

98
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.170
all the things that I think are effective and we're trying to do it as like

99
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.440
ethically as possible.
That's why there's the money back guarantee.

100
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.790
Don't even have to send back your pills.

101
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.910
We also have a lot of shit there that's irrefutable like fitness equipment,

102
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.550
the kettle bells,
the bells that we've talked about,
a battle,

103
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:34.660
ropes and weight vests and all stuff for which we would call functional
strength.

104
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.600
Not like bodybuilder's strength,
but strength.
Or You could use,

105
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.130
if you ever wanted to pick up a box or something,

106
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:42.120
if you ever want to apply it to a athletics.
Uh,

107
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.490
so go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and it use a codename Rogan and you'll save

108
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:48.120
yourself 10% off any and all supplements aren't you?

109
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.920
Dirty fucks Mark Marin's here,
Cuban music and let's keep it as it come on.

110
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:57.200
It was one of the quickest commercials.
If he was,
he was ready.
It would come on.

111
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.040
You were going to talk about

112
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.780
<v 2>San Diego.
That's all you're talking about on the podcast experience.</v>

113
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.110
Joe Rogan podcast.

114
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.550
Yeah.
Before we even get going.
Um,
this is,
today is the 15th.
So the,

115
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.510
what is the dates?
You have the shows in San Diego.

116
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:18.900
It's the 19th and 20th at the American Comedy Company.
Oh,
this year shows.
Yeah.

117
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.630
Who you with?
Uh,
were there with Mike Black.
Benji.
I followed Brody Stevens,
Yoshi,

118
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.710
Sarah,
Tiana,
and there's going to be secret guests that pop up that uh,

119
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.870
I can't talk about.
That's a big show.
There's a lot of people.

120
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.720
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Yeah.
And Mark Marin,

121
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.900
you're in Nashville this weekend.
Nashville,
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday at Zany.

122
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.260
He's one of the great American comedy clubs.
Yeah,

123
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.770
definitely the amazing pictures of men with mullets around the wall.
Oh,

124
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.660
so it's like when you've been doing comedy as well,
because we have it.

125
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:48.440
Do you go to these clubs?
You're like,
ah,
what the fuck happened to that guy?

126
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.900
The guys,
you go to those clubs.
I think that guy had gotten a thing with a girl.

127
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.370
And what happened to that guy?

128
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.680
There's a quite of a few of us who fall off the log just to a man.

129
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.140
I don't know why.
You know?
Sometimes it's a sad story.

130
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:06.380
Sometimes when I run into those guys and they tell me,
they just sorta like,

131
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.500
I just stopped.
There's part of me that thinks like,
good for you.

132
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.520
How do you fucking quit this shit?
I don't know.
I've thought about it before,

133
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:15.830
but your price is not going to get you to do that.

134
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.630
I just don't know what they live with once they go.

135
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.590
I think it would be probably a couple more comfortable life if you quit,

136
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.910
but for a while though,
you wouldn't get the highs.
You wouldn't get the charge.

137
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.050
You wouldn't get the,
the danger,
you know?

138
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.550
I think part of that that you get to sedentary.

139
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.320
I think if you get to calm and it's dangerous,

140
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.680
and if you were the comics life and you're not a comic,

141
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.490
you're just a fucking loser.
You're a crazy person.

142
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.570
It just a guy that lives out of boxes.
You're going to coffee.
Yeah.

143
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.220
Going from town to town,
yelling at people,
talking in a way,

144
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:53.520
disproportionate amount.
You get to talk way more than they did.
Yeah.

145
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.150
I don't know.
I it like,
it's sort of heartbreaking after a certain point when I,

146
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.520
like I ended up on my podcast,
I ended up,
you know when you tour the south,

147
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.520
you always see those eight by tens of that dude.
Killer bees,

148
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.910
like who the hell is kill or be huge there.
But I interviewed him,

149
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:11.680
he came out and like I had no idea what his comedy,
so like I just known,

150
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.491
I had heard about him,
he,

151
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:16.370
that he was a regional guy and he came out and we ended up talking about Leonard

152
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.630
Skinner for 25 minutes.
Oh,
that's all was I,
you know,
you,

153
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:21.440
you gotta love the guys that stick,
you know,

154
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.040
that stay in it and just to live the life no matter what level they're out of

155
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.490
who they are.
Yeah.
It's the thing that we,

156
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.140
we all that are doing it and know it's like,

157
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.050
it's so taxing and incredibly difficult,

158
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.890
but we also know what that feels like when it all comes together.

159
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.030
When you feel you're in the groove,
it's,
everyone's laughing.
They were there.

160
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:43.760
They feel so good because of it.

161
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.030
There's like a direct benefit that you get from other people feeling good about

162
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.850
one mind.
That moment when you're on stage.
Like what if I'm onstage now,

163
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.980
but sadly,
you know some guys who I can you if,
if you

164
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.150
<v 1>think about some dudes,
white dudes,</v>

165
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.610
they don't change your act or do to be doing the same act for 20 years.

166
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.170
It's like that moment you're talking about for them.
No,

167
00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:06.390
it happened in 1987 the end,
they're chasing that moment that's almost more,

168
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.310
more sad than people that quit.
No,
definitely.
Definitely that they,

169
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:13.980
they're just autopiloting it and you know,
it's just by the row for me,

170
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.070
like the best thing that can happen on stage is something I didn't anticipate.

171
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.270
And it comes out of nowhere.
And as long as it lasts,
it's amazing when,

172
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.860
cause then the risks are really high,

173
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.860
then all of a sudden you have an emotional investment and you don't know where

174
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:29.310
it's going to go and there with you and you just ride that out for as long as

175
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:31.800
possible and then you don't even want to go back to your act.
You're like,

176
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:36.740
how the fuck am I going to transition out of this to the prepared thing?
And,
uh,

177
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.930
I try not to,
I try not to rely too heavily on the,

178
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:41.340
on the structure just so I can get that.
Yeah.

179
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.740
<v 0>Buzz.
Yeah.
I think that's the,
my favorite way to do comedy as well.</v>

180
00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:47.950
And I think all my favorite guys do it that way.
Like Joey Diaz does it that way.

181
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:50.110
Our,
he does it that way.
Dunkin does that way.

182
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.580
There's not like a very strong beginning in a very solid,
if the train goes left,

183
00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:55.900
we're in the woods now folks.

184
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.320
I want to get tee shirts that say fuck the big closer.
Yeah.

185
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.590
What is it about people though that if you don't close strong,

186
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:08.110
like I don't feel good about it.
They don't feel good about it.

187
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.090
It could be almost awesome movie ever,

188
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.880
but if the last three minutes suck that movie so

189
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.620
<v 1>well,
no,
that's true.
I think it's what they go away with in their head,
you know,</v>

190
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:20.190
cause that's going to be the biggest moment.
If you end on that high note,

191
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:22.650
they're going to walk out going,
yeah,
but have you ever had that?

192
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.070
You probably don't,
but I,
you know,
I can flounder,
you know,
still to this day,

193
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.933
you know,
I can do it.

194
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.930
Like if I'm not doing as well as I want or I've done like an hour and it's not,

195
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:33.960
I haven't gotten satisfied and there was no way I'm going to pull them up over

196
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:37.470
the hump depending of self sabotage,
you know,
I just stay on for two hours.

197
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.380
Like you know like if if I'm doing not great,

198
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.380
I'm like well the least I can do is give them a lot.

199
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.060
If I'm not going to close strong,
I don't want them to walk out saying hey,

200
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.510
not only did he not glow strong but he got off after an hour.
No,

201
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.030
I'll give him two hours until I'm breaking apart.

202
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.110
But that rarely happens in two hours is a long fucking time and there's never

203
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:01.160
really that big.
Is there ever a reason to do two hours?

204
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.940
<v 0>I used to do long shows when I used to do is I used to do my set and then I used</v>

205
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:07.520
to do a Q and a with the audience.
This is all pre podcasts.

206
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.710
What about that I liked,

207
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.110
I liked taught anything else that people yell out things and I would talk about

208
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:12.850
anything and everything.

209
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.930
<v 1>That's the best thing I ever heard.
I did that twice where I'm just,</v>

210
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.110
because of the podcast,

211
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:20.830
people do have questions like whether it's about an episode or whatever.

212
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.680
So I started doing that.
And then you're,
you're really in it?

213
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.360
<v 0>Yeah,
I did it after my special to,</v>

214
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.110
I put microphones in the audience and I had people come up to the line and ask

215
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:32.680
questions and they really worked in Ohio because I had never done it before.

216
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.040
Then the second time it was like,
it all was like two podcasty.

217
00:11:36.041 --> 00:11:40.030
Like people sort of like got into this groove where it's also like they know you

218
00:11:40.031 --> 00:11:42.430
a lot more.
It got really weird.

219
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.320
<v 1>Yeah.
But I'll say like a,
yeah,</v>

220
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:47.630
because you don't know whether to you want to be funny because theoretically

221
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.580
just stand up show.

222
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.400
But if people ask the right questions and they're sort of like,
they just,

223
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.250
<v 0>yeah,
regular answers.
I give those to man.</v>

224
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.420
<v 3>I mean,
I,
I will,
I will risk derailing the whole thing with the truth if a,</v>

225
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.440
if you're doing a Q and a and someone has to,
you know,

226
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.320
someone asked that like a hard question,
right?

227
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:05.410
But you've also got things that you're knowledgeable about that people want to

228
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.970
talk about,
whether it's health or psychedelics or time travel,
you know,

229
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.310
the practical pigs.
It does become a problem.

230
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.220
And I'm also a cage fighting commentator so there's a little,

231
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.290
there's always like this question is like,

232
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.500
I want to Anderson Silva and like you get into those conversations so you can

233
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:26.430
answer that question short of yeah.
Sort of this big,

234
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.030
very little comedy and the cage fight revolve around.
Are you happy?

235
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.230
Tell us about the time when you're going to kill yourself.
Did you find that?

236
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.560
Don't get that cause they,
but I get cats,
I get happy,
I get relationship stuff.

237
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:45.250
I get the,
um,
did you ever test yourself for Toxoplasma?
Not yet.

238
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.980
I'm thinking about doing it.
Why you got cats?
Yeah,

239
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:50.860
I've got cats and I had a feral cat.
I have feral cat for years.

240
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.310
When I first was living in California,
my friend Lanie,

241
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.540
her and her boyfriend found like a whole box of cats underneath the house right

242
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.580
near their place in Santa Monica and they were babies and you know,

243
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:07.510
I'm always been a guy picks up strays,
stray dogs and straight people.

244
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.400
I'm big with the straight people.
I used to do that,
but I realize those,

245
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.780
those create a lot more problems than cats.
Even that trunk.
But I had this cat,

246
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:18.760
it was totally feral and I had to sleep with it in a room to calm it down to the

247
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.120
point where it could deal with me.
Could you touch it though?
Couldn't write.

248
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.870
I couldn't,
but then I could,
when I could,

249
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:27.310
it would start pouring till I picked it up.
I mean it would go crazy.

250
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.410
I mean just run up the side of the wall,

251
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.770
tear the curtains apart and you really didn't think you could calm it down.

252
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.890
And then I would sit with them and I'd give him some food and,

253
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:38.920
but once I started touching him,
he would be preparing like crazy.

254
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.130
I couldn't do it,
Mike.
It's hard.
Well my,

255
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.210
like if there was it young feral was baby,
it was a day that you got in there.

256
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:47.320
Like even the ones I have,

257
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:51.550
I think they were out there three months so they were wired for the wild and

258
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:55.480
even now I can touch him both picking him up as a little tricky and they're
also,

259
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:58.750
they're still wired for the wild.
Like you know,
domesticated cat.

260
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.010
Something could drop right next to it and it,
it won't do anything.

261
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:06.330
Like you know what those fat,
dumb domestic cats like something could fall down.

262
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.580
They don't even move these cats.
Right.
They're wired.

263
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.440
They're still fucking wild inside.
That's like humans,
human from the Congo.

264
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.380
She would have gone off next to them.
They'll die for the bushes.

265
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:18.400
They know what the fuck's going on,

266
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.030
why I'm not from the Congo and I can guarantee you I would have that exact same

267
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:22.510
behavior.

268
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.270
I would have that behavior when I shot a guy with a gun coming up the driveway,

269
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.320
I would die for the bushes.

270
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.410
So I know that I was around cats that were most likely,

271
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.590
if not exposed as a high likelihood they were exposed.
What is,

272
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.280
isn't that something that you can carry and not have any,

273
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.270
it might not have any effect on you,
but there's these,

274
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.530
some studies that say might make you nuts,
is that the deal goes bad for,

275
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:48.520
there's a guy named Robert Sapolsky and he is a,
for the,

276
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:51.070
all the people that have heard this on the podcast million times.
You're like,
oh,

277
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.790
he's going to talk about that again.
Um,
I think the one guy,

278
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:58.010
he said he was nuts because that the thing,
oh,

279
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.600
that was a different guy that was a neurosurgeon.

280
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.470
He was worried that he was nuts.
So Polsky doesn't have it.

281
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:08.240
But he was when he was an intern,
right.
He did a time in the Er and he said,

282
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.690
one of the things that doctor said was they would ask the test for Toxo.
Right.

283
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:13.310
And they had a motorcycle victim.
Right.

284
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.880
Apparently there's a disproportionate amount of people involved in motorcycle

285
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:21.510
crashes that test positive for Toxo knew that bikers had cats at sweet.

286
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.490
Might not be cats.

287
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:26.270
It could be eating meat that came from a field where the cat shit,

288
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.260
that's also possible.
This a very dangerous,

289
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:32.270
it's the reason why pregnant women are told to never touch cat poop.

290
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.350
He can't touch,
go near a litter box because of this stuff gets in.

291
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.300
It could really damaged.

292
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.740
I should tell my girlfriend now that stop playing with the catch and don't play

293
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:43.990
with cat shit catches bad,
put on some gloves if you going to knock her up.
Um,

294
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.240
but it,
it,
it,

295
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.250
it apparently makes men more aggressive and they've also made a direct

296
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:53.930
correlation between toxoplasma infestations and successful soccer teams.

297
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.400
Hmm.
The more,
more people that are tested positive for plasma,

298
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.990
the more their soccer team does.
Well,
this is like this such random shit.
Yo,

299
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.580
that's like a,
you know,
like I,
I'm one side,
I'm like,
wow.
Yeah,
maybe I do have it.

300
00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:11.960
I am kind of an angry fuck,
but I don't have any compulsion towards soccer.
Well,

301
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:16.160
no,
this,
this is one of the reasons why I'm asking is that someone on my board,

302
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.510
I'm actually brought this question up.
Yeah.
Because,
uh,
they,
you know,

303
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:24.490
they've seen different videos on it and they've seen people talk about it.
Right.

304
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.900
It's something that,
I mean we worry about Joey,
Joey Diaz,
Joey has,

305
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.300
he has 11 cats.
I think he has 11.
Yeah.

306
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.360
I don't know there's any way that I couldn't have it.
If it's possible.

307
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.210
I mean I've had a few cats but also had feral cats.

308
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.990
I know you had a few of them that you were feeding outside.
Right.

309
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.690
But I don't touch them.
But you know,
the two I have inside were originally feral.

310
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.570
Like the two guys that I got now,
dude,
there's a cat outside.
There's a,

311
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.670
I have a wildcat.
I have two wild strays that I feed back.
Can't touch him.

312
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.790
One of them is fucking totally death.

313
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.330
How tough does that cat have to be?
Well,
he's out there with fucking corrupt,

314
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.250
you know,
coyotes,
Shit.
My cat boomer who is,
who lived down state,
he disappeared.

315
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:07.850
So the coyote has got that dumb fuck.
But like who I loved.
But nonetheless,

316
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.890
I can't understand why these other two live.

317
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.880
How does that death black cat live in my boomer is gone.

318
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.230
I'm assuming from coyote.

319
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:19.130
He has to be the t like can you imagine to be able to feel the ground or

320
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:20.940
elevated senses,
but like,

321
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.790
cause I can walk right up to him if he's sweeping and then he'll wake up and

322
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.920
smell so fucking bad.

323
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:31.250
I mean stop and think about just rotten meat.
Your senses,

324
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:34.010
your other senses get elevated if one of them goes,
yeah,

325
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.060
one of the best pool player in the world,
uh,

326
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.040
is a guy named Shane van boning and he has a hearing aid and he shuts it off

327
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.950
when he plays quite a down.
Yeah.

328
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.270
Well he doesn't want to hear anything and in doing so,

329
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:45.680
I mean he's just really good anyway,

330
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:50.220
but in doing so he thinks he has an advantage.
Yeah,
I believe it.
Maybe that black

331
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.320
<v 1>cat,
it's just a death like with an f.
Yeah.</v>

332
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.700
<v 3>That's very cute.
It's Brian stumbles through it too,</v>

333
00:17:58.701 --> 00:18:02.110
cause he knows it's going to suck halfway into it.
He's like,
well,

334
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.180
he came up with that about 40 seconds ago and he was like,

335
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.470
I can't help basic band.

336
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.260
There's a hole where I can dump my dumb black joke in.

337
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.260
We'll just wait for that whole speaking to dumb black jokes.
Um,
this is,

338
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:19.400
uh,
this is the week for folks that are listening to this in the future.

339
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.320
This is the week that the Trayvon Martin trial concluded in George Zimmerman

340
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.870
being found not guilty.
Right.

341
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.560
And this is a fascinating time in our culture and I'm just really glad that you

342
00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:33.080
were coming on the podcast today because I really wanted to get your take on

343
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.220
[inaudible].
I'm up to speed out of the loop,
but anything about it,
I know.

344
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.740
Well,
I know about the law that they have in place your ground.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I,

345
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:47.390
and I didn't know what happened for the most part and I know the verdict.
Hmm.

346
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.290
Well that's very good of you to,
um,
to be honest about that.

347
00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:54.620
I think that's super important when it comes to these fucking big hot topic

348
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:56.210
issues that everybody wants to discuss.

349
00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.980
One of the things that's been really gross.
It's like the people that are almost,

350
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.660
it feels like to me like they have brownie points for like running towards a

351
00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:08.670
progressive opinion in a very aggressive way.
Sure.

352
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.250
Like Miley Cyrus tweeted it,
no justice,
no peace.

353
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.870
Like aren't you fucking 12 or something?
Are you really,
and you're a stoner,

354
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.270
you're saying no justice,
no peace should we have,

355
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.350
we really should have no peace because it was so other people should die because

356
00:19:24.351 --> 00:19:26.930
something went wrong here.
And the judicial system,

357
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.230
<v 1>I think what you have there is classic reactionary thinking.
Exactly.</v>

358
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.500
And you know,
I've been that guy,
I know what that guy is.
I mean,

359
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:36.720
you know you for figuring it out.
Well,

360
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:41.100
you know [inaudible] after doing political talk radio for a year and a half.

361
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.830
And like when I went into,
when I started Air America,

362
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.540
I was just a reactionary guy.
You know,
I was a lefty guy but I was not educated.

363
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.770
So you know,
basically anything that was anti authority,
Anti Republican,
you know,

364
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.510
antiwar,
I'd be like fuck deck.

365
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:57.000
I mean that my comedy was like that to some degree.

366
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.750
But then when you get in the trenches of it and you really start to educate

367
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:03.270
yourself about what issues are,
you know,
how,
you know,

368
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:08.271
radio personalities are being used by a political parties to move talking

369
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:10.990
points.
You know,
what the talking points are.
You know,
the,

370
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.060
when it comes down to being a real progressive,
they're not so kneejerk,
you know,

371
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:18.150
they're fairly deliberate.
They're fairly focused on what their elements are,

372
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:22.290
what their causes are,
and how to sort of facilitate slow change.
You know,

373
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:26.820
rapid change is not,
you know,
really possible.
But with these kinds of issues,

374
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:30.180
it's very quick.
And I wrote,
I tweeted something yesterday,
I said,

375
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:35.181
there's that occasional self righteousness is more annoying than consistent self

376
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.790
righteousness.
Yeah,
it's true.
And it's exactly what you're talking about.

377
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.090
It's just,
and you know,
out of nowhere somebody just goes,
you know,
rude.

378
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.060
And they don't stand for that.
And the other day,

379
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:48.130
or really engaged in the public conversation.
But as soon as there's a hot

380
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.540
<v 3>topic and there was momentum with it,
then everybody's like,
they get righteous.</v>

381
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.860
Yeah.
Dunkin's friend Duncan was at a party and his friend started crying and

382
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:01.170
screaming that she wanted to kill Zimmerman.
She was saying,
I,

383
00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:04.630
I swear to God I would fucking kill him.
And he said,
she's a lawyer.

384
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.190
She was crying and screaming like,
could you just picture that though?

385
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.780
It's picture silver lake.
Okay.
Hipsters.
Okay.

386
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.800
It's like everyone's like trying to be in the top of the moral food chain here.

387
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:22.240
Everyone's trying to,
you know,
be,
be Vegan the longest,
you know,
and then this,

388
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.170
the verdict comes down and she's screaming that she would kill Zimmerman if she

389
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:29.800
could,
which is amazing.
Well,
for me,
you know,

390
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.960
in my experience,
uh,

391
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:35.710
in the last day or two without doing a hyper amount of research is that,

392
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:36.550
you know,

393
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.520
those types of gun laws are tricky because when things like this happen,

394
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:44.380
it really comes down to,
uh,
uh,
he said,
and the dead guy said,
so,

395
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.020
you know,
the dead guy can't talk.
And on top of that,

396
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.250
you mean even if the gun laws weren't tricky?
I mean,
even if what he did was,

397
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.320
you know,
completely illegal.
The bottom line is how did it happen?

398
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.490
Like what's going on?

399
00:21:57.491 --> 00:22:01.420
You have people patrolling that can't defend themselves and they carried guns.

400
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.440
And what was he,

401
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.680
was he justified in bothering that kid or was he bothering that kid?

402
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:09.130
Just because that kid was black to be talked to the young man to be say,

403
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.350
hey buddy,
what's going on brother?
Where you at?
Where are you going?
Oh,

404
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:14.370
my dad lives over here.
All right,
cool man.
Have a good one.
Yeah,
you know,

405
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.900
it could,
it could it have been handled that way.
Well that's what,

406
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:17.770
that's what the point is,

407
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:22.390
is that once a guy's dead and you have a law that says you can defend yourself

408
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:25.960
with a gun,
it's on you,
then you know who the hell knows what happened there.

409
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.820
You just got a guy who says,
well,
this is what happened.
Look,
I,
you know,

410
00:22:28.821 --> 00:22:32.370
I black guys have whatever and you know,
and I killed him.
Well,
let's,

411
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.860
let me play devil's advocate here and I don't,
I don't really have a,

412
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.650
I don't think that this is a clear black and white issue.

413
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:41.140
Pardon the palm of my hand.
Um,

414
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.650
I think it's very interesting that Zimmerman has the last name,
Zimmerman.

415
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.470
Cause if it was Ortiz things would get really weird.

416
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.200
But even though he's Latino and he has his Jewish last name,

417
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:52.050
so it's become a white thing.
It's,

418
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.310
it's really kind of interesting how the segmentations of the race in this.

419
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.780
When I go on Twitter and I look at all the different peoples,

420
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.820
black people overwhelmingly in support of Trayvon Martin overwhelmingly and a

421
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:07.150
lot of white people not,
you know,
and then no,

422
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.070
I don't hear anything from Latino folks like it.

423
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.490
There's not a black versus Latino thing.
So in the,

424
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.570
the base argument of weirdness when it comes to racism in the,
in this,

425
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:20.500
in this scenario,
because I think it is,
there's a lot of racism involved.

426
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.060
Whenever there's any hot button topic,

427
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.300
it's black or white or is it just automatically going to get a certain amount of

428
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:28.570
it?
But I saw very little from Latino folks and I thought that was interesting.

429
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.090
Well,
they might not know that he's a Latino.
Yeah.

430
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.890
While it may not be registering,
I mean,
some guy,

431
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.170
he called me out this morning on Twitter saying,
you know,

432
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.910
Zimmerman's Hispanic asshole,
because I had said on my podcast today,
you know,

433
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:44.911
that there is a different set of rules that people of color that Brown people

434
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.200
have to exist by.
Right.

435
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.640
<v 1>Uh,
in terms of what they have to be afraid of and how they accommodate,
you know,</v>

436
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:54.320
those fears.
Uh,
so whether he was Latino or not,

437
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:59.300
my issue with it is that if you have somebody who's given a gun,
all right,

438
00:23:59.301 --> 00:24:02.840
and they have a job to do that might involve a gun.
Uh,
they,

439
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.100
he can't just be a vigilante kind of thing.
You know,
like a,

440
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.050
it seems that there was a protocol that wasn't paid attention to that.

441
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:11.810
If you're patrolling a gated community and you see trouble,

442
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.250
you should call the fucking police.

443
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.890
<v 0>I think he did.
I mean,
and again,</v>

444
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.620
I'm not exactly sure of the x.
You get his version of it.
You can,

445
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.500
that's all you get.

446
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.320
But he did call the police and they told him to go back to his car apparently.

447
00:24:25.321 --> 00:24:28.370
And he says the kid jumped him.
That's what allegedly happened.

448
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.550
<v 1>So the kid had a die.
It's just,</v>

449
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.240
<v 0>I know what you're saying.
Look,
I am not in favor.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
At first of all,</v>

450
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:37.090
I don't think anybody who can't defend themselves should ever be allowed to be

451
00:24:37.091 --> 00:24:38.530
in a position where you're enforcing laws.

452
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:41.290
I think it gets very dangerous if you can't physically defend yourself.
Yeah,

453
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.760
cause I think,
I mean,

454
00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:45.280
and this is obviously coming from someone who has a history in martial arts,

455
00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:47.710
but I,
I don't,
I think it should be mandatory.

456
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.900
It's like you can't defend yourself if you don't.

457
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.410
If you don't know how to physically engage someone and you panic and this guy on

458
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:55.990
top of you beating your ass,
you shouldn't have been there in the first place.

459
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.060
Not only that,
if you're that guy,

460
00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.450
what are the odds that you handled the situation?

461
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.000
Interaction with this young man with confidence.
If you're a confident person,

462
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:06.920
you go,
hey man,
everything cool you,
you know,
you mean your boat.

463
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.040
<v 1>Do you have a,
if you have a gun that Trump's confidence for Maura?</v>

464
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.260
It doesn't though.
It doesn't though,
because they didn't earn it right when?
No,

465
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:15.870
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying that as a,

466
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.570
as a k as like a prerequisite.

467
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.340
I'm saying that an idiot with no confidence with a gun feels calm.

468
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.970
<v 0>He does.
But let me tell you something.</v>

469
00:25:24.971 --> 00:25:27.130
If someone gets a hold of you and you have a gun,

470
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.750
you know how long it takes to shoot a gun.

471
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.360
You have to make sure that it's cocked.

472
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.300
You have to make sure that the safety's not on.
If there's a scramble,
right.

473
00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:36.400
Fuck did.
If someone gets a hold of you,
you're done.

474
00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:39.310
You're not gonna be able to if you're far enough away.
Right?
Yeah.

475
00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:43.060
But in his situation,
he shot the guy with the guy was on top of him.
Yeah.
I mean,

476
00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:44.710
the guy was grounding and pounding him.

477
00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:46.390
It was beating his ass and he's on top of him.
Like,

478
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:50.400
<v 1>how did it get to that?
Why the kid attack you?
What,
what the fuck did you do?</v>

479
00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.210
Like how did,
how badly was this handle?
Or is the kid crazy,

480
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.890
wildly aggressive.

481
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.230
But also that's one of the questions is at what point does,
does profiling,

482
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.180
you know,
bring out anger sure.

483
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.190
In somebody's lives that life that is the different set of rules that black

484
00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:11.460
people have to live by in this country is that that guy said,
you know,

485
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.060
me made it just been walking across the God damn way.
And you know,

486
00:26:15.061 --> 00:26:19.290
at everybody's got a breaking point and if you're just being called out because

487
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.990
you know,
some guy with a gun,
some fucking rent,
a cop,
you know,

488
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.550
decides he's going to pull rank on you and because you're black and he's just

489
00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:28.170
going to call you out because of that.

490
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.770
Who the hell knows when anyone's personal breaking point is?
It's like,
you fuck,

491
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.980
I'm just walking home,
asshole.
Fuck you.

492
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.450
<v 0>Exactly.
Abs of Fuckin lutely.
Abso-Fucking-Lutely and um,</v>

493
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.860
that's why I think law enforcement in this country is one of the least

494
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:44.820
appreciated things.

495
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:48.300
And it should be handled as an like it should be a high honor.

496
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:52.710
Like someone who's a cop should not just be like someone who enforces the law

497
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.820
and tells you what the fuck to do.

498
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:58.110
It should be a like a valuable part of your community safety and about

499
00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:02.850
fellowship and about friendship.
It shouldn't always be like that.
I wish,
I hope.

500
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:04.110
I mean maybe they can be,

501
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.980
<v 2>well I think that when there were beat cops and when neighborhoods were tighter</v>

502
00:27:06.981 --> 00:27:08.990
and when,
you know,
things seem more controllable.

503
00:27:08.991 --> 00:27:11.870
I mean the weird thing that happens I think when you really think about what a

504
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:15.320
cop does and it,
I dunno when I had this realization,

505
00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:18.320
but it's not an uncommon when it's out there is that at some point,

506
00:27:18.321 --> 00:27:19.970
especially if you're in a city and you're a cop,

507
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.670
you realize like this is never going to end.

508
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.090
What I'm fighting is never going to end.
And you know,

509
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.440
it's sort of like taxing that that must put on your emotions to know that every

510
00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:34.690
fucking day some fucking idiot is going to sue something stupid and I'm going to

511
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.300
be,
you know,
you know,
I'm going to have to defend my life,
defend my community,

512
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.790
you know,
do what's right by the law and it's never going to get better.
Never.

513
00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.500
That's an exhausting,
fucked up job.
So I agree with you.

514
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.110
<v 0>Well I grew up with a cop.
You know,
my dad,
he grew up,</v>

515
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.140
I mean I say until I was about six is the last time I spoke with him,

516
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.870
but he was fucking insane.

517
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.430
And I don't think that there's any small part of the job that he had been a

518
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:04.060
police officer in Newark,
New Jersey or Harrison and Newark crazies cry.

519
00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.020
You know what I mean?
I remember very little of it cause I was young,

520
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.440
but it's like living with savages.
There's monkeys with clothes.
I mean we were,

521
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:14.400
we were all Italians and there's all these Irish people and there's Puerto

522
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.060
Ricans and black folks and it was crime.
And,
and people back then were like,

523
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:20.760
monkeys were a monkeys with clothes.
I mean we were,

524
00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.770
we humans have the 1960s and seventies bear no resemblance to the fucking people

525
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:30.030
you see today.
Is that true?
Oh fuck yeah.
Well those are the ones that were,

526
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:30.271
you know,

527
00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:34.050
our age or younger and the six things have now they're just exhausted old men

528
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:37.260
that don't have the energy to be as actively monkey like as they used to.

529
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.120
I think also though that accelerate,
I think like the,

530
00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:43.320
the kind of violence that you see today is probably accelerated.

531
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.980
It's like you saw it in a different way then I think probably because this is

532
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.470
all pre crack,
pre meth.

533
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.610
<v 2>It was also also pre sort of uh,
you know,</v>

534
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:55.890
any sort of evolution from,
from,
you know,

535
00:28:55.891 --> 00:28:59.190
institutionalized racism and the time is that there was,
you know,

536
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:01.530
there was a very specific,
you know,
color lines drawn.

537
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.510
You're not that far away from any sort of progress legally with,
uh,
with,

538
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.010
with race in this country.

539
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.000
So the tensions were still very real unless you went off to a university and

540
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:16.050
escape the boundaries of the confined got the fuck out.
Yeah,
you have to get out.

541
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.060
I mean all those east coast towns,
which is crazy.
And they were,
they were so,

542
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.920
you know,
everybody had their clan,
you know,
and if it was the Irish claim,

543
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.310
it was crazy.
You just watch those fucking movies and it's fucking nuts.

544
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.970
I remember kids wanting to fight me cause I was Irish because I had an Irish

545
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:33.620
last name,
but I was Italian and I was like why you got an Irish last name?

546
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.440
I'm like,
cause I'm part Irish.
You fucking mic cock sucker.
I'd be like,
oh Jesus,

547
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.940
are we really fighting over nothing over nothing.

548
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.040
I got the tribal shit like to believe that

549
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.560
<v 3>people have evolved more.
I don't know.
I think they're,</v>

550
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.370
I think they're more distracted.
I think they're more connected to other things.

551
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.410
I think that the tribes have broken up,

552
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:53.380
but it seems that there's still a lot of angry monkeys out there of one kind or

553
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:54.730
another.
That's inevitable.

554
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.520
And there's a button and I think a lot of it we can just attribute to shitty

555
00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:58.031
parenting,

556
00:29:58.031 --> 00:30:01.720
shitty parenting and shitty communication in shitty environments where these

557
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:04.660
kids grow up and they just don't,
they don't get good feedback.

558
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.500
And if they're not a positive environment,
they don't get good feedback.

559
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.020
It's fucking hard to be a route.
And also shitty friend human.

560
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:15.670
Make sure all the above,
all the above,
guaranteed and guaranteed.

561
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.970
But I think more of them can escape today because of the Internet.
Right.

562
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.360
And because of podcasts and because these and pick books,

563
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.120
find a a racial chat room that you can,

564
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.540
as long as you're not on the streets.

565
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.480
If you're just putting out hate on to Twitter and you're,
you know,

566
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.890
you're living with Xbox live,

567
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.400
we can always just be an egg on Twitter and just have some fucking crazy name.

568
00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.410
Just find celebrities.

569
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.350
You call those idiots who have several names where you know,
they don't think,

570
00:30:41.351 --> 00:30:45.550
you know,
like you block them once and then they're back and it's the same tone.

571
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:50.200
See a troll tone is so fucking hackneyed at this point.
And I know it is.

572
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:54.550
And it isn't an interesting that you could read someone's text and know that

573
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:57.040
it's the same person.
They're all the same person.

574
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.160
It's one big same person that just wants to get a rise out of people for no

575
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:07.870
fucking it.
And it always works with me.
I have to fight it every God,

576
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.160
even when I go,
look,
that guy's got six borrowers and no picture it.

577
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200
It takes everything in my mind not to cause I liked the fucking hate buzz.

578
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.740
I like an anger buzz Joe.
It's a fun buzz.
I'm a victim of it myself,

579
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:24.400
but it's a dangerous buzz.
It's not a good one because it bites you back.

580
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.510
I had this weird realization that like,
you know that that like,

581
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.660
I'm trying to track it because you know,
I've had anger problems,

582
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:35.950
you've had anger problems,
but there there is,
when you feel the rage,

583
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.120
there's a warmth in your chest that you know,
that surrounds your heart

584
00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.980
and some part of you thinks like,

585
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.380
I need to follow this through and to stop that,
you know,

586
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.680
to stifle that and let it go like that.

587
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.980
That immediate feeling where you feel that rage and then you want to stop it.

588
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.550
It was the first feeling I have when I want to stop it.
It's like,
well,

589
00:31:57.551 --> 00:32:01.240
I feel I should just cry.
Then I'm going to go,
I'm just going to start crying.

590
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.100
Shit.
While you're doing it,
be feel way better afterwards when you don't cry.

591
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.230
Yeah.
If you just stuff it.
But sometimes I collect those,
you know?

592
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:13.630
Sometimes it's like there's a battery being charged.
Well,

593
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.360
we talked about it on Twitter the other day.
You know that you can catch it.

594
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.600
You actually sent me a message saying like being an asshole and saying that we

595
00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:24.400
have to drive you.
You and I had to shit.
That's just what people do.
They love it.

596
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:28.940
The little orchestrators of doom patrol.
No,
I don't like it either,
but,

597
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.800
but I,
I,
it's in my mind,
it's my cousin walk me and Rogan and finally,
okay,

598
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:34.510
don't fucking,
oh,
I need,

599
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.460
I don't need a some sort of a hug assignment lights.

600
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.350
It's one of those things where it's like,
that's what they gravitate towards.

601
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.310
Unhappy People gravitate towards that and I think is it unhappy?
Yeah.

602
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:50.080
I think it's a small percentage of people,
but if you only get a couple of day,

603
00:32:50.081 --> 00:32:51.380
I mean think it'd be,
well,
yeah,

604
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.150
like hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers and 10 or 20 of them are cunt

605
00:32:56.151 --> 00:33:00.210
bags.
That's really awesome numbers.
If you really stop and think about it,
I'm,

606
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.020
I'm all about to,
you know,
uh,
the,
the sort of breakdown of the numbers,
you know,

607
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.470
because your controversial,
you know,
you're an outspoken guy.
Course you are,

608
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.640
of course.
I don't know from that controversial,
I suppose inside the garage,

609
00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.770
the grand spectrum of human beings.
I mean,
what is the number,

610
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:18.470
where do you fit in?
Is it between one and a thousand?
You're,

611
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.840
you're certainly in the 500 range.

612
00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:24.650
I tried to be as honest as possible with what I'm doing and he,
you know,

613
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:27.560
I don't know if that's the controversy.
I think that's probably it,

614
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:30.200
but I'm not out there on the cutting edge of,
of issues anymore.

615
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.850
I'm not doing politics anymore.

616
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.250
But I think that when you put your heart out there,

617
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:36.200
however you're going to put it out there,
if you're honest with it,

618
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.710
I guess it's negative.
I mean,
you know,
I,
I'm curious about that,

619
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:42.050
but when you make yourself vulnerable publicly,

620
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.400
there's always going to be fuck heads who were like day.

621
00:33:44.401 --> 00:33:48.080
I see a soft spot and it hit it,
hit it and like,
you know,

622
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.710
I'm familiar with that behavior.
I've been guilty of that behavior.
You know,

623
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:54.920
it's straight up sort of bullying and sort of looking for a reaction.

624
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.420
I just think that some people enjoy any reaction.
Like,
you know,

625
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:03.080
even if it's anger or if it's positive or what,
as long as they get it,

626
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.040
that feeds something in them,
they will.
They also get validation.

627
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.510
You're interacting and you see that that guy wanted to kill me.
He likes me,

628
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.480
he cares.
He,
I made an impact.
Well,

629
00:34:14.481 --> 00:34:18.080
there's also something that happens when you're the guy who gets to talk and

630
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:20.330
you're obviously the guy who gets to talk or give a podcast.

631
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.180
So people are listening and they disagree and they want to go,
you know what,

632
00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:25.310
Merrick,
mark them tardy fucking bullshit.

633
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.050
Fucking egos get in the way of this show.
And they'll go,
fine.
That's another,

634
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.190
they love to say that because they're the ones with ego problems for the most

635
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.690
funny cause I never get that one.
Yeah.
I don't get ego.
I get,
you know,

636
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.510
quick complainant ego and my own message board.
If you'd talk about your ego,

637
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.710
the ego thing never come at me like you.
Like usually I get the,

638
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.680
I get this sort of like complaining guy.
Like you know,

639
00:34:48.681 --> 00:34:52.490
like the main criticism of me generally is that,
you know,
you talked too much,

640
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:56.810
your problems aren't that interesting.
You're whiny.
That's ego.

641
00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.310
Sure.
Of course.
Your concentrate on yourself.
Right,
right.

642
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.750
But I think our egos manifest themselves differently.

643
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:05.390
I'm not saying I don't have a big ego,
but I'm,
I'm going to complain.

644
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:07.640
And you're gonna,
you're gonna rain.

645
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.130
The raining and the complainant egos tried to do very little raining.

646
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:16.670
I try to do very little engaging.
I do a lot of blocking.
A very real,
yeah.

647
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.310
I don't really argue with people on Twitter.
I've done it before.

648
00:35:19.311 --> 00:35:22.280
It's like you steak,
he can't last,
you can't win.
You also,

649
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:26.420
it feeds it and I don't want to be involved in it.
So if I,
if I'm feeding it,

650
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.470
then it's like I'm feeding,

651
00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:29.630
I'm putting attention to something that's not important to me.

652
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.390
And I think the analogy that I was used as,

653
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:36.860
it's like snake venom haters or they're healthy for you and I think you'd get a

654
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:40.310
little of snake venom and you can get fucked up.
I mean it's really dangerous.

655
00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:44.250
Sure.
If you put a tiny bit,
every now and again you get immune to it.
Oh really?

656
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:48.270
So I just have to like just taking a little hate day to exercise your emotional

657
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:52.060
exercise.
It's like you,
you're not,
I mean,
the more positive you get,

658
00:35:52.061 --> 00:35:53.820
that means you're putting more positive out,

659
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.890
but you're always going to get some negative.

660
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:57.450
And it's how you interact with that negative.

661
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.850
If you just let it dissolve and go away,

662
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.190
of course it's going to be people that are assholes.

663
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:04.920
The fact that they focus on you for some random reason.

664
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.970
What are the odds you're going to do something that's really completely asshole

665
00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:11.520
ish that demands someone reach out and call you a piece of shit in a fucking
Lou.

666
00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.690
If very small.
I,
I've become more considerate,

667
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:19.800
but I am prone to ask your life.
You're considerate as a feedback

668
00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.990
<v 1>because I feel better about myself and what's happened.
You know,
like you know,</v>

669
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.510
eventually when you're an insecure guy for years and you know,

670
00:36:28.511 --> 00:36:31.480
all you're looking for is a way to sort of make,
you know,

671
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.630
make your own thing or to get,
you know,
become relevant or,

672
00:36:34.631 --> 00:36:38.310
or be appreciated for what you do.
That I don't think,
I think B,

673
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.910
even when I talked to you on the podcast,

674
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:42.910
I don't think I'd reached a point to where like,
you know,

675
00:36:42.911 --> 00:36:45.640
I felt validated and I felt like,
you know,
I did something,

676
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.930
we have self esteem fans now and they're not looking at me for positivity.

677
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.100
They're looking to me.

678
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.440
I think that what they see is that a guy who struggled and stuck with something

679
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.880
and somehow persevered.

680
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.720
So I think they indulge me a bit of negativity in a bit of a,
you know,

681
00:37:01.721 --> 00:37:04.420
sort of aggravation.
Like I tend to,
uh,

682
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.810
I think a lot of my fans are very sensitive.
They're a little,

683
00:37:07.811 --> 00:37:10.650
a little disenfranchised a bit.
They're a little,
uh,

684
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.180
kind of worked up about things and there are little in their head.

685
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.580
So I think they see in me a guy that like,
well,
you know,

686
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:18.610
Marin kind of stuck it out.
So there's that narrative.

687
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.390
I don't think they're looking at me to give them advice necessarily or to say,

688
00:37:22.391 --> 00:37:24.340
you know,
you can do it or anything else.

689
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.830
I just think they look to me to realize that like,

690
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.510
well maybe I'm not alone and you know,

691
00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:30.790
everyday being somewhat of a struggle or a fight

692
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:35.400
<v 3>to self sabotage thoughts.
You don't agree with us really.</v>

693
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.700
Well I think that uh,
the self sabotaging,
like I really tried to,

694
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.880
like I try to isolate that and just figure out how I did it.

695
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.860
I think that if I self sabotage,

696
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.700
<v 1>like I was never one of those guys that didn't show up for work or,
or,
or,
or,</v>

697
00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.880
you know,
showed up,
fucked up or fucked things up on purpose.
You know,

698
00:37:51.881 --> 00:37:53.800
I don't think I ever did that,
but I,

699
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.650
I think that if there's anything self sabotaging about me,

700
00:37:56.651 --> 00:38:00.070
it was that I was inconsiderate and that,
you know,
I was,
you know,

701
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.050
hyper competitive and insecure.
So I don't think that I,

702
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.360
I was one of those guys that,
uh,
you know,
had a big,
you know,
an important thing.

703
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.140
I'd go,
I'd do everything I can do to do well.
You know,
I didn't do that.

704
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.100
But I think because of a certain amount of defensiveness that I made a bad

705
00:38:15.101 --> 00:38:15.934
impression.

706
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.020
<v 3>I think when you said earlier,</v>

707
00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:19.660
it's really important that there's that narrative too.

708
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.170
And I think that which one,
the one will,
you just said about your life,

709
00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:27.070
about getting through your struggles,
right?
Right.
People hear that and they go,

710
00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:27.371
okay,

711
00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:30.070
this isn't a guy who was a captain of the football team and got straight A's in

712
00:38:30.071 --> 00:38:32.980
high school and everybody loved them.
And was still smiling.
Oh look,

713
00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:36.130
he's never been angry.
I've never seen Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeah,
no,

714
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.170
<v 2>it's,
you know,
you're completely different animal.</v>

715
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.010
And I think that in that narrative,
I think that it's,

716
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.670
there's a important message that there's a,

717
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.830
is a giant spectrum of us and we all come from weird starts and we don't all

718
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:51.460
start on the same,
oops.
The same block shit.

719
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.180
I just tripped on my fucking lap.
Did you go in the keyboard?
You think?
Uh,

720
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:59.110
yeah it did.
But I think I got to a quick enough.
I think so.
My other one died.

721
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.330
I did that one.
Well,

722
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.160
yeah.
I don't think anything got in there.

723
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.370
Let's just hold it this way just to be stroked.
Let's get a tower though.

724
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.630
Don't they have like the Shit you could dip your whole laptop and like,

725
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.300
it's almost like,
uh,
I fucking killed,
I killed the computer like that.
It's just,

726
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:19.000
it is the worst feeling to see that cup go over.

727
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.720
But that didn't go directly on it.
You know what?

728
00:39:21.721 --> 00:39:26.660
Samsung has a new phone now to fucking completely,
um,
I saw that.
Yeah.

729
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.370
They can go like 10 meters under water with it.
It's on my guts.

730
00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.660
The fuck ain't got so fucked up.
It's like how,
like something like that.

731
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.150
You literally,
when something like that happens,
you're like,

732
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.080
I don't know anything about anybody.
I don't know people's phone numbers.

733
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.480
I don't know.
He might screenplays on there.

734
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.710
Not In the cloud or you're not backing up backing up now,
but it takes,

735
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.040
it just takes one of these events to realize like holy shit,

736
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.810
about half of my brain just got short circuited cause of a coffee issue.
Yeah.

737
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.150
It's outside of my fucking head.
I need to have rules.

738
00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.320
Like if I was in the military,

739
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:01.870
I don't have rules about where the coffee is allowed to be.
Well,
yeah,
I'm,

740
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.790
I'm pretty good with that.
That seemed far enough away though.
So,

741
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.220
and it's all on me.

742
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.910
I'm just going to leave you drink Starbucks like me and enjoy this nice mood.

743
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:14.410
You would have a lid.
Oh God.
Damn.
Um,
so yeah,

744
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:18.460
we all come from different places and I think that's that your story.
Like,

745
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.070
you know,
having a story like that where you calm down,
you know,

746
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:24.130
I think that's good for people to calm down and learn how to watch your fucking

747
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:26.140
mouth.
Where and how to sort of treat people better.

748
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:29.140
For me it was really about selfishness and just,
you know,
look,

749
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:33.490
I've been a defensive asshole,
but I'm not the kind of guy.
Like,
you know,

750
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:37.210
I'm not like evil.
Well,
no,
but no one was ever afraid of me,
you know,

751
00:40:37.211 --> 00:40:40.540
when I was an asshole.
Like,
it's amazing like guys who,
you know,

752
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:43.950
who come from more,
the tough guy,
ilk,
they're,

753
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.890
they're usually surprised like,
you know,

754
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.620
how did Marin not get his ass kicked yet?

755
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.470
How come no one has kicked Marin's ass is want to kick your ass.
Yeah.

756
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.760
I think Brian Cowen wanted to kick your ass at one point in time.
Yeah.

757
00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:01.180
That was the thing,
right?
Like right.
I remember you talked about that.

758
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:04.130
There were a couple of guys that have beats with me and I talked to Joey Diaz

759
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.780
about,
about,
like his thing with me.
And that was,
that was just again,

760
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.620
inconsiderate.
Yeah.
It was not.
Um,
but with cal and too,

761
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.780
I think that at that time when he started out,

762
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.220
like there were these guys that came into the scene and to the alternative scene

763
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.670
that were real sort of like,
you know,

764
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.350
sketchy kind of character driven and I was condescending.
I was,

765
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.820
I was sort of like,
eh,
it's not stand up,
you know.
So I think that whatever,
sure.

766
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.820
I think he didn't want to kick my ass.
Yeah.

767
00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.960
He's not a fun thing where we like to,
again,

768
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:35.990
we get an a camp and then I'm in the alternative camp.

769
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.160
I'm in the prop camp I'm in and we just to everybody else who doesn't do that

770
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.130
well at that time it wasn't alternative.
It was just that,
you know,

771
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:46.640
like they were in and now everything's fucking change.
Dude.

772
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.730
I mean when I started and you started,
you know,
shortly after me,

773
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:54.560
cause I remember seeing you at stitches like early on.
I was in [inaudible] 88.

774
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:56.390
When did you start?
Um,

775
00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:02.210
just start coffee out of the USB port.
Did you,
did you,
did you get some I,

776
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.600
that's what I do with my cell phone.
Like if I drop it in water,

777
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:07.410
I suck out all the water out of everything.

778
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.060
What would be amazing right now is if you started to now have the memory

779
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.570
capacity of that computer and you could sell a whole new fucking thing,

780
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.290
that'd be pretty bad chemical.
I was talking about it.
It's called never wet.

781
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.530
It's actually this chemical that you're going to be able to put on anything and

782
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:23.120
it just makes anything waterproof.

783
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.500
There's a process where they dip your iPhone and you can dip an iPod and a bunch

784
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:31.610
of other electronics stuff is,
no,
that stuff's been around for years.

785
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:34.840
He used to put it on windshields like I remember like my windshield wipers broke

786
00:42:34.841 --> 00:42:36.560
when I was in high school and you could put this stuff in the,

787
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.130
the liquid would beat up and just roll off.
Yeah.
I had that shit.

788
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.790
I used to have to put it on my muscle car because it didn't have a wipers.
Right,

789
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:46.430
and it just roll off.
It was kind of cool to watch.
It's amazing.

790
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.430
It's actually like,
and then the wipers,

791
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.780
somebody just put it on their shoe in the mud.
Look at that mud.

792
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:56.570
Just get off of that.
That's incredible.
This,

793
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:58.590
this is the new stuff that just came out and this is like,

794
00:42:58.591 --> 00:43:02.600
it's incredible what you're going to be able to dip anything into wow.
Laptop,

795
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.500
but it's still not going to stop things from going into holes.
Yeah,
no,

796
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.480
and I'm saying you dip the whole entire laptop,
everything.

797
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.780
We'll have that on there.
So when water goes inside of it,

798
00:43:10.781 --> 00:43:14.810
it will coats everything.
All the electronics side,
all the it going to happen.

799
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.550
It's already just came out.
All right.

800
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.480
So we're just doing it for phones to keep an eye on this technology for when it

801
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:22.430
happens.
Yep.
It's called never wet.
All one word.

802
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.040
You would have to send your phone to them the way it used to be.

803
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:25.910
I was a different company.

804
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.310
But you send their phone for him and they dip it and they send it back to you in

805
00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:32.070
a day and that's done.
Yeah,
it's done.
So camp,

806
00:43:32.071 --> 00:43:36.060
so let's talk about these camps.
The camps of people.
I mean,

807
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.110
when we started out,
it was primarily,

808
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.620
the line was drawn at botax prop packs,

809
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.490
but you don't remember about,

810
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.460
I remember botax very what now we know guys,
you know who started with us.

811
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:52.340
They make a good living on boats and I'm not going to deny them anything.

812
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:55.190
They're good comics.
They keep it clean.
It's just another gig.

813
00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:58.970
See you evolve like that.
You know I got no real fucking beef with,
I never,

814
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.210
after a certain point I got no beef with anybody.
I really don't.
It's like,

815
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:05.210
would you be mad at a guy who was a waiter on a boat?
No.
No.

816
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:07.160
So why would you be mad at a guy who's a comic con?
Well,

817
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:08.740
I think there was a time where we,
you know,

818
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.030
there was this thing which like real comics and not,

819
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.740
and guys who were just entertainers.

820
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.830
I think there was this idea that there were truth tellers and then there were

821
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:20.831
these guys that just wore clown noses in my situation that my prejudice against

822
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:24.410
people was completely based on insecurity.

823
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:28.220
I was worried about being accepted myself.
So it's like,

824
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.040
you're like fuck people who aren't like me or fuck you.
It's like,
I'm

825
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.290
<v 0>just like,
it was almost like lashing out first,
you know.</v>

826
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.980
<v 1>So what I did,
that was my whole life.
That was if there was any self sabotaging,</v>

827
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.670
it was literally greeting people with like,
is there a problem?
Do we have a,

828
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.470
is there an issue?
Yeah.
How you doing?

829
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.770
<v 0>You gave me some,
I,</v>

830
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:49.980
I've talked about this on your podcast and I always tell people that the,

831
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.070
one of the reasons why you and I uh,

832
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.810
even though we weren't like a friendly for a long time,

833
00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.140
you were a very important part in me as an open miker because there was one time

834
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.291
when I was like,

835
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.720
I was only been doing it for like a few months and I didn't know what the fuck I

836
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:08.250
was doing.
I was baffled.
Yeah.
And you were established pro and you get,

837
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.350
yeah,
it was in my mind you were a pro.
Yeah.
And you gave me advice.

838
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.680
It was a good,
that was great.
You complimented me and he gave me advice.

839
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.120
<v 1>Yeah.
See that's the,
see this is the other part of my,
my fucking,
here's,</v>

840
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:23.670
if you want to know how I sabotage myself,
this is how I sabotage myself is like,

841
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.220
you know,
I'm a guy,
you know,
I'm a loner.
I've never been a pack animal.
You know,

842
00:45:27.221 --> 00:45:27.941
I've never like,
you know,

843
00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:31.290
I like to be accepted by packs but then I like to be able to leave.
Do you,

844
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:34.120
you know what I mean?
It's,
I got a bunch of cats.
Yeah,
sure.
Exactly.

845
00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.010
I got to and a couple of Devin,

846
00:45:36.011 --> 00:45:37.870
a deaf one and another one that doesn't talk to me.

847
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.810
But like in terms of insecurity,

848
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.680
like I've actually doing this weird bit on stage where it's not even weird,

849
00:45:44.681 --> 00:45:47.920
but it's a just a moment that were where someone brings up a dude.
Like,
you know,

850
00:45:47.921 --> 00:45:49.620
like you could be say yeah about that kind of go,

851
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.360
I know that guy's a fucking Dick,
I fucking hate that guy.

852
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.760
And then the other guy could say like,
that's weird cause he wanted to meet you.

853
00:45:54.761 --> 00:45:58.450
I'm like,
really?
Well,
okay.
Yeah I'd like to meet that.
Do you know what I mean?

854
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.110
Like,
I didn't think that guy likes me.
And then everything changes.

855
00:46:02.111 --> 00:46:04.900
So that's fundamental insecurity because I think that back then,

856
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.080
like what I knew of you is that,
you know,
you were pretty tough guy.

857
00:46:08.081 --> 00:46:08.960
You're a kick boxer.

858
00:46:08.961 --> 00:46:12.930
He came in and I'm sure I had the same sort of attitude that I have,
you know,

859
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.450
in my heart around people that are physically threatening or athletic or

860
00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:20.350
whatever,
you know,
like I like to say about people like me and you.
I say,
yeah,

861
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.820
you know,
we've been fighting for centuries are type yet.
But,

862
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.870
but I think that really what it comes down to is that when you talked to a guy,

863
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.810
you know,
we've got the same heart as you and the same goals as you.

864
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.610
Like you can make people what they,

865
00:46:33.611 --> 00:46:37.060
you think they are until you meet them and then you realize that's not who that

866
00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:37.580
guy is.

867
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.360
<v 0>Yeah.
And I always,
uh,
in your defense and in anybody's defense,
I,</v>

868
00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:44.990
if I didn't know me,
I would assume I was a douchebag.
If I,
you know,

869
00:46:44.991 --> 00:46:48.470
especially if I couldn't defend myself or if I was worried about those type of

870
00:46:48.471 --> 00:46:51.020
people that would be involved in that kind of shit.
Cause there's,
you know,

871
00:46:51.021 --> 00:46:53.030
the stereotype of anybody who would be a fighter.

872
00:46:53.031 --> 00:46:55.460
It's like some hyper aggressive asshole.

873
00:46:55.461 --> 00:46:59.480
But I tried to be like as friendly as possible all the time.

874
00:46:59.481 --> 00:47:02.630
So in my mind it was almost like a,
like,

875
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.010
I mean I'm not trying to get sympathy but like experienced a weird kind of

876
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:11.030
prejudice where people like automatically put you in this meathead category

877
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.490
automatically treat you as if you're causing a problem.

878
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.330
<v 1>That's interesting because that's exactly what black people go through in this</v>

879
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.370
guy.
But I don't think I would have it that bad.

880
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:23.080
But coming back to the Trayvon thing and talking about going by,
yeah,

881
00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:27.070
that self consciousness.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.

882
00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:29.650
But I just thought it was interesting to tie in that,
you know,
you have to,

883
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.400
you know that people are going to judge you a certain way and that you have to

884
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:36.790
behave in relation to the social realities of that stereotype

885
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.070
<v 0>sort of.
But with mine it was far more about people.
I did.</v>

886
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.100
You know what I'm saying?
I know you're right,
you're right.

887
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.300
But what I'm saying is I'm like,

888
00:47:45.301 --> 00:47:47.850
mine was so mild cause you look like a normal person.

889
00:47:47.851 --> 00:47:50.880
Like did you find out about me and martial arts and all that stuff and then you

890
00:47:50.881 --> 00:47:52.110
go,
okay,
this guy's got it

891
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.490
<v 1>fucking Weirdo.
But the real question is insecurity or not.</v>

892
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:58.310
Like I think we can both admit that we had shifts on our shoulders for women.

893
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:02.170
<v 0>Oh for sure.
Not only that,
I'm both admit insecurity.</v>

894
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:06.190
I think insecurity is like without insecurity there's no growth.
Okay.

895
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:09.130
And you're not going to be born out of the hatch with all the fucking answers.

896
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.510
You need to have some instability.
You need to balance.
You know,

897
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.460
you need to like lean to the left.
If you're falling to the right,

898
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:18.100
you need to figure that shit out.
And if you don't have that,

899
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.250
you just grow up super confident.
You could hit by trains.
You know,

900
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:23.560
you fucking somebody who's kind of bumbled through life.

901
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.080
It's the thing that drives us nuts is that we never feel secure.

902
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.310
But that's like literally what makes us rise to great heights is what makes all

903
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:34.940
great art come from the struggle.

904
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.550
<v 1>I think that I could have used a bit of better parenting.</v>

905
00:48:38.551 --> 00:48:41.580
I mean was there ever a time where,
you know,
maybe before,

906
00:48:41.581 --> 00:48:45.360
I don't know what drove you to,
to,
to engage in the activities,

907
00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:45.901
you can engage them,

908
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:49.230
but was there ever a time where you felt like you had self esteem issues?

909
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.080
<v 0>Oh,
for sure.
Oh my whole life.</v>

910
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:56.110
Absolutely 100% and when I was a child it was more so it was extreme because I

911
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.190
didn't know my father and my stepfather is a very good guy and we got along

912
00:49:01.191 --> 00:49:04.000
great.
What?
There wasn't no issue there and there's all I,

913
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.060
I'm really happy that there was that stability that,

914
00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:09.110
and my mom is a very nice person.
Yeah.
We moved all over the place.

915
00:49:09.111 --> 00:49:11.810
They didn't have any friends when I was always moving to a new town.

916
00:49:11.811 --> 00:49:12.890
So it was a nightmare.

917
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.360
May mean a minor nightmare though in comparison to like what we're talking
about,

918
00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.930
the issues are escalated when it's a minority escalated even more when you're

919
00:49:20.931 --> 00:49:22.190
dealing with extreme poverty.

920
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:23.231
<v 1>Yeah.
Well what I,</v>

921
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:27.580
what I always regret and if anyone talks to me about it and I think this is

922
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:30.070
relative to the conversation is that,
you know,

923
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.120
I don't have kids and I know how I was brought up but it was a real hands off

924
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:38.470
real kind of my parents were very self involved but like if anyone asks me about

925
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:40.720
kids or whatever is,
I always tell them I said the one,

926
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.720
the only thing that I really regret is not being given the opportunity to have a

927
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:46.450
healthy sense of competition.
Like,

928
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.480
like knowing you know even sports or any way that you realize that like winning

929
00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:55.120
and losing is not life threatening.
It's not,

930
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:59.410
it's not self threatening that because I didn't engage in that or I wasn't a

931
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:01.980
team player or I didn't get involved in like,
you know,

932
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.130
that spirit of things or even like you do with healthy competition where you're

933
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:09.640
like,
well good game if that's not part of your life.

934
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.450
Every competitive thing that you engage in become sort of like threatening.
Yes.

935
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.380
That there's no way to sort of regulate,
you know,

936
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:20.530
that this is not a personal attack.
And I,
you know,

937
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:21.880
I didn't have any of that experience.

938
00:50:21.881 --> 00:50:23.860
And I think that if you deal with team sports,

939
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:27.980
you deal with even single like one person sports that you get that sentence sort

940
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:30.230
of like,
all right,
good game men.
Maybe tomorrow we'll,
you know,

941
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:31.370
I'll do better or whatever.

942
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.730
Whereas if you're a competitive person and you have no discipline around it,

943
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.330
you're fucking defensive and you're going to take personal shots.

944
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.510
And that's how my insecurity revealed itself.
And that's why people,

945
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:44.480
you don't want to kick my ass if not,
if it,
Collin wanted to kick my ass,

946
00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.530
it was because I was preemptively defensive and hostile and judgmental.

947
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.160
And I dumped it on him and he was just a guy trying to be funny,

948
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.430
and he knew that he could kick my ass.
And he chose not to do that.

949
00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.590
So I will thank him for that.
I'm not,
it's not hard to kick my ass,
but,

950
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.010
but out of that lack of confidence that you get,

951
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:06.740
or that lack of sense of like not everything's threatening,
not every,

952
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:07.880
it's even like a roast.

953
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.810
Like I'm not even good at roasts because I take things personally and if I'm

954
00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:14.960
going to insult somebody,
I mean it,
there's no,
you know what?

955
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:17.900
I'm cutting to the bone.
I'm not looking for the laugh.

956
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.150
I've gotten better at that.
I can,
I can,

957
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.360
I can take the hit a little better and I enjoy it.
But,
uh,

958
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.810
but it's really hard if you're a competitive person,
Andrew insecure,

959
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:29.690
and you have no sense of healthy competition,

960
00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.630
no one's gonna wanna hang around with you and everyone's going to think you're a

961
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:34.900
Douche bag.
And what you said is a really important,

962
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.160
it's sort of threatens your self definition when you lose some,

963
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.870
takes something away,
right?
It your pride,
you're like,

964
00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:44.150
you know your manlihood,
you're,
you know,

965
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:48.440
like how other people are going to see you.
It's fucking like,
there was one time,

966
00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:52.570
this is rock and roll oriented,
but uh,
it's kind of a funny story in,

967
00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:56.930
in this that like there's a real difference between judging yourself against

968
00:51:56.931 --> 00:52:01.310
other people and,
and just judging yourself against your own work.
It's a,

969
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:04.690
it's a hard shift to make cause like a lot of my career was built on like how

970
00:52:04.691 --> 00:52:08.420
that fucking guy get that.
Why is that Guy Popular?
Why can't you get me to get,

971
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.700
why can't I be on that show?
What the fuck?

972
00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.390
As opposed to not realizing at that time.
Like I got all that stuff.
Oh,

973
00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:17.480
a lot of my breaks early on,
we're out of spite and looking back on it,

974
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.980
I wasn't ready for it and I,
and I botched it just because like I had no,

975
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.900
you know,
I was all about the competition.

976
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:29.410
But there was this one time where I was at a music camp and,

977
00:52:29.751 --> 00:52:33.050
uh,
it was just basically my parents sent me to this camp and they let you smoke.

978
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.220
It was great.

979
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.720
I was like 14 and we could smoke cigarettes and play guitar all day.
Wow.
Yeah.

980
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.760
And then the final night,
like,
you know,

981
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:44.390
there was a big performance where the people in the camp put together beds and

982
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:48.320
stuff and uh,
and you perform for the whole camp in this big band shell.

983
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.070
So of course I ended up with these fucking stoners and shit heads,
you know,

984
00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:56.360
and we're just like the guy I had playing bass,
he was okay.
Long haired dude,

985
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:57.560
they're all troubled guys.

986
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.430
And a while we wanted to do is play some chuck berry songs.
You know,

987
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:03.590
I figured how hard could Johnny be good be,
you know,

988
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:07.340
how hard we should be able to pull that off.
Right.
And we're all,
you know,
14,

989
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:08.300
15 years old.

990
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:12.050
And then there's this other crew of kids that were complete fucking music nerds

991
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.270
that like new fucking how to read music.

992
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.320
And that could play better than any of us in.
So here's what happens.

993
00:53:17.321 --> 00:53:22.070
So we go on and all the dudes I'm with get fucked up before we go on stage,

994
00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:25.950
which is doing Johnny be good man.
It's,
it should be easy.
It's three chords.

995
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.230
<v 2>My drummer's too fucked up to play drums.</v>

996
00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:32.280
The guy on piano is not playing in the right key and it was a disaster.

997
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:33.810
I started singing out of key.

998
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.390
It was the most shameful and embarrassing fucking thing I ever,

999
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:40.980
I might as well just shit my pants on stage and then we get off and those other

1000
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:41.731
guys get up there.

1001
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:44.790
And in my memory they played the entire side of a genesis album.

1002
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:46.200
That's my memory of it,

1003
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:50.700
that they got up there and they did some amazing thing and I felt fucking

1004
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:54.960
invisible.
I felt ashamed and to,
you know,
literally till maybe two years ago,

1005
00:53:54.961 --> 00:53:55.740
I couldn't fucking,

1006
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.940
I was afraid to sing in front of people for half of my life because of that.

1007
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:03.020
And if I just,
you know,
you know,
put more thought into,
you know,

1008
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.450
making the song better and working with these dudes and just like learning how

1009
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:08.490
to do that shit,
I wouldn't have fucking,

1010
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:10.860
it's a weird story and I don't know if it really applies,

1011
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:15.720
but I do know the feeling afterwards of embarrassment and shame and I felt that

1012
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:18.900
those guys had won and I fucking hated him for it.

1013
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.460
<v 3>This in the Bible man,</v>

1014
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:25.830
that story as sharpens iron people sharpen people.

1015
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.620
Yeah.
Yeah.
So what it is,
man,
you need to feel that.

1016
00:54:28.621 --> 00:54:31.200
You need to feel lost in order to realize what you did wrong,

1017
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.530
but you can't live in it.
Yeah,
you can't live in it but you,

1018
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:36.390
it motivates you to move forward and it motivates you.

1019
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:39.630
But that terrible feeling shouldn't be ignored.
It should be figured out.

1020
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.940
It's like you got to figure out what,
what is,
what is causing this?

1021
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:45.600
But you can lock into that feeling for many years.
Look at my,

1022
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:49.550
look at my computer's doing now.
Look at us.
Oh no dude,
I'm sorry man.

1023
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.150
I'm sorry man.

1024
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:56.040
It's just flashing on and off like a strobe light flashing blue and white.

1025
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:59.110
How obsessed you are with that right now?
Not really.
I'm just it,

1026
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.430
I've got another one.
You do?
Yeah.
It's got everything in it.
Yeah.

1027
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.530
It's all backed up.
That's the beautiful thing about like,
uh,

1028
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.580
like backing up your laptop.
It's backed up.

1029
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:12.540
It's backed up and you have to worry about shit.
So what,
tell me about this.
Um,

1030
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:13.830
all right,
so the vitamin thing.

1031
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:20.070
My old man,
yeah,
you're old man was like a series of vitamin guy.

1032
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.430
<v 2>Well,
like he was a guy that was like Mister Western medicine,
you know,</v>

1033
00:55:23.431 --> 00:55:25.720
his whole life,
you know,
real practical.
You know what I mean?

1034
00:55:25.721 --> 00:55:27.650
That he was a surgeon,
he did all his business,
you know,

1035
00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:31.980
he resented chiropractors.
He didn't fucking engage with any of the bullshit.

1036
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.450
And then like his wife kind of took a turn and he stopped practicing,
you know,

1037
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.830
his medicine and now he's completely consumed with supplements,

1038
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:45.060
chiropractors,
anything.
But you know what he used to do?
That's interesting.

1039
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.480
Turn of medicine completely to the point where it was annoying and he had me on

1040
00:55:48.481 --> 00:55:53.100
like 15 things a day.
He had me on Co Q 10 phosphatidylcholine.

1041
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.610
He had me on fish oil.
He had me on this thing called memory revitalizer,

1042
00:55:56.611 --> 00:56:01.560
which some guy that he knew made,
he had me on.
His big thing is vitamin D.

1043
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.540
He's like,
you gotta load vitamin D,

1044
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:08.010
like he would get me these 50,000 I see whether I use or whatever,
vitamin D,

1045
00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:08.880
and then he tells me once,

1046
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.720
he said that's the key to everything and I was on all this shit and I felt

1047
00:56:12.721 --> 00:56:13.554
nothing.

1048
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.930
<v 3>No different when you're exercising.
Sure.
A little bit.
I haven't been lately.</v>

1049
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.560
I think that's a big part of it.
Like you,
whether you feel yourself,

1050
00:56:21.561 --> 00:56:23.980
like if you're doing something strenuous,
whether

1051
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.790
<v 0>it's yoga or in a sort of sport.
Yeah,</v>

1052
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.220
and you kind of know what your body does under stress,
then I,
in my opinion,

1053
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.910
it's easier to gauge whether or not supplementation is helping him because you

1054
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:37.860
know what your natural performance levels are at and you're walking around all

1055
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:41.530
day just doing normal shit.
Talking to people.
So I mean is it a good day?

1056
00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:44.750
Is it a bad day?
Did I wake up tired?
Is actually what's going on with my head.

1057
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.660
Is Vitamin working?
I'm not sure.

1058
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.540
<v 1>Yeah,
I was doing yoga and I was doing,
you know I was running like a,</v>

1059
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:54.500
I've sort of faltered it that Ferris gave me a fucking kettle bell like at 35

1060
00:56:54.501 --> 00:56:58.060
pounder and it just sits there and to me it's just something that I'm going to

1061
00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:00.050
hurt myself with it.
I just,

1062
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.360
I just see it on the foregoing and it's sitting there going,

1063
00:57:02.361 --> 00:57:03.230
when are we doing this?
I'm like,

1064
00:57:03.231 --> 00:57:06.410
when I know I'm not going to hurt myself because you can hurt yourself with

1065
00:57:06.411 --> 00:57:07.030
those can't yet.

1066
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.130
<v 0>Yeah,
you definitely should get someone to like,</v>

1067
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.930
you could at least have someone go through like the first exercises ever with

1068
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:14.764
you.

1069
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.280
Once you get it you can do it yourself because it's just some simple principles.

1070
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:21.580
Sure.
Follow with like basic exercises like a kettle bell swing,

1071
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.910
great exercise and it's really simple and all someone has to do is show it to

1072
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:28.000
you like a couple of times like like this,
make sure your back is straight.

1073
00:57:28.001 --> 00:57:31.100
This is how you pop the hips out.
You'll figure it out and it's great exercise.

1074
00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.640
But on Youtube and there's a lot of youtube they didn't know you sent me one of

1075
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:36.220
him doing it and I'm like having someone in front of you though is better

1076
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:39.190
because someone should say,
okay,
see what's going on with your back.

1077
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:42.280
You got to strike like a lot of times it's hard to be self aware and look at the

1078
00:57:42.281 --> 00:57:46.210
video and say mine exact same position.
Like if you have someone showed you,

1079
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:48.550
it's usually better.
I had a trainer for a long time.
It did.

1080
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:49.870
It feel like a lot of the core work,

1081
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:52.650
<v 1>you know with the balls.
I do like a push ups on the balls,</v>

1082
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.590
Jack Knife on the balls and all that core stuff.

1083
00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:58.010
It was great but then I moved and I now I can't find that fucking guy.

1084
00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:02.900
I need you to
give me a name because get a girl.
Yeah,

1085
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:07.010
yeah,
that's fine.
In your life.
Don't listen to him.
I had a girl for a while,

1086
00:58:07.011 --> 00:58:11.360
but it didn't,
it didn't like,
she was annoying me.
Tried to impress

1087
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.760
<v 0>all more so I wouldn't actually work out harder.
You know,</v>

1088
00:58:13.761 --> 00:58:17.450
like I don't want to be a pussy.
Why don't you put that to the test man?

1089
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:21.620
I could use it.
I think I could use a trainer.
I think it would be a good idea.

1090
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.610
It's not a bad idea.

1091
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:24.980
Especially if you've got someone who knows what they're doing.

1092
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.530
I don't know how to find that person.
If I go to a gym and just go to a gym,

1093
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.790
I see now there's the first step.
I'll lock it.
A White Guy,

1094
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.370
not a guy that wants to kick my ass.
Kicked your ass,
relax,

1095
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:41.210
relax.
Days told me to relax.
It was a,
that was a for real though.

1096
00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:44.910
Would you like when I was a kid,
you know,
doing uh,
you know,

1097
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.610
doing standup for the first time,

1098
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.390
like having a guy like you give me advice like that.

1099
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:52.660
Sears is one of the most important parts of like my early open mic day.
Yeah.

1100
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.020
That's what I tried to do that as often as possible when I can.
Yeah.

1101
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.330
You think you're a lot,
you're a lot harder on yourself.

1102
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.400
Like as far as like the way you behaved,
you didn't,

1103
00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:02.600
you didn't really behave that much weed.

1104
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.570
I would just have these weird moments who made you yeah.

1105
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.000
Back in the day they weren't,
they weren't terrible.

1106
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.160
<v 1>No,
I don't think so.
I,
I it was just,
it was really what I'm telling you.</v>

1107
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:14.830
It was really,
I think that thing that we've been fighting for centuries,

1108
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.770
you know,
we're both,
we're both self centered dudes.

1109
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:22.130
We have big egos and you know,
you can kick people's asses.
I could only just,

1110
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.790
<v 2>you know,
a kind of caused severe aggravation.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1111
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.360
but at the button pusher,
in the end,

1112
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:31.460
what's really fascinating about the relationship,

1113
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:34.410
the standups have to each other is even if I don't like a standup that much

1114
00:59:34.411 --> 00:59:35.600
we're running into at the airport,

1115
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.440
I'm happy to see them over almost anybody else.
Yeah.
There.
Yeah.
Oh,
me too.

1116
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:43.760
And there's nobody that I don't like that much unless they're criminals.

1117
00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:47.420
Your there,
you know bad dudes.
And that's a small number.

1118
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:51.170
When criminals in Mielec joke thief,
no,
I mean like criminals,
criminals.

1119
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.660
Back in the day there were some guys where you didn't want to like,
you know,

1120
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:56.580
and I'm not going to lend you money and I'm not giving you a ride.

1121
00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:58.450
I'm not going to give you a ride anywhere.
No,

1122
00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:01.870
I'm not going to stop at this place for you and have you come running out and it

1123
01:00:01.871 --> 01:00:03.580
goes step on it.
Yeah.
We,

1124
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:07.910
we all know certain dudes from those Nick's comedy stop days.
Oh Dude.

1125
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.100
You just like,
what the fuck is going on here?

1126
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.660
I've got to go down to the parking lot.
What's going on in the parking lot?

1127
01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:18.560
Do you want to go?
I don't think so.
I don't think I want to go.
Yeah.
Frankie,

1128
01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:22.460
best deal was that dude like he,
oh my God,
I took him on a drug run.

1129
01:00:22.461 --> 01:00:23.870
I was too stupid even know it.

1130
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.530
Driving around the lower east side so he could like run in and visit a friend

1131
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:30.140
and then like he comes out,
I'll sweaty.
We went,
oh fuck.

1132
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:33.780
We went down in New York once.
I was living in Boston.
He,

1133
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.790
he's dead now but he needed to score Frankie done long time ago.

1134
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.190
It's been a few years.
He,
I think he had a,
uh,

1135
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.990
I believe he had HIV but he,
you know,
he was also like a hard court junkie.

1136
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:46.940
But before I knew he was a dope addict,

1137
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.770
like I was such a sucker cause you want to hang,

1138
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.640
I am very compelled towards dudes with like,
you know,

1139
01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.640
crazy ass personalities with a lot of charisma.

1140
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.970
Cause my dad was a nut bag so I will always look for nut bags to hang out with

1141
01:00:58.971 --> 01:01:01.730
because they're entertaining.
So we had me drive in New York,

1142
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:04.210
we'd go to the lower east side.
He goes,
yeah,
just pull it around,

1143
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.710
drive around this block.
A couple of,
I had no fucking idea what he was doing.

1144
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.270
So I guess he went in,

1145
01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.800
he got high and he got back in my car and he was just started pouring sweat and

1146
01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:15.830
couldn't shut up.
And then he goes,
Jimmy tingle is around here,

1147
01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:19.280
you know Jimmy Sober guy.
So I don't really know Jimmy that well.

1148
01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:21.350
But I knew him well enough and he was living in New York at the time.

1149
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.560
So Frankie calls Jimmy and we go to Jimmy's house,

1150
01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:29.561
Frankie's now like babbling and sweating and fucked up and weird and he brings

1151
01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:32.970
Jimmy's bell and Jimmy's like,
I'm about to go do a gig and Frankie's like,
Eh,

1152
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.820
can I just take a shower?
I just need to take a shower.
And Jimmy's like,
I,
okay,

1153
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:38.750
I guess you can take a shower.

1154
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.290
So now this junky is showering and we're holding Jimmy yet.

1155
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.980
But it's just moments like that where you like,

1156
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.950
I had no idea that this guy was a fucking con man,
criminal dude.

1157
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.950
And then poor tingle,
I don't even know what he,
if he even remembers that,

1158
01:01:51.951 --> 01:01:53.750
but at least he was a safe criminal dude.

1159
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.990
Best deal might get you in trouble if he took me to the wrong place.
Right.

1160
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.700
But he wouldn't try to rob,
you know,

1161
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.190
we knew a few guys that would try to rob you.
You know,
not that guy.
Yeah,

1162
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:08.450
no bad guys,
bad people or you get into situations.
That's one of the reasons why,

1163
01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:10.790
you know,
the drug thing sort of wore out from me is that,
you know,

1164
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:13.340
you doing the right kinds of drugs in the wrong kind of places,

1165
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.380
you exponentially grow your,

1166
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:20.610
the possibility of you catching a fucking bullet or a bad turn is just amplified

1167
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.670
exponential.
You doing coke with Kinison?
Yes,
I was a kid.

1168
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.630
That's legendary.
Double.
If you stop and think about that,
that's like,

1169
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.880
you mean doing coke with Kennison is like in the world of standup comment.

1170
01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:37.500
It's like shooting heroin with miles Davis.
Right.

1171
01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:41.190
But he also pissed on my bed and it very up.
He's a good guy.

1172
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.730
He was not a great guy.
Oh No,
I'm not saying that.
No,

1173
01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:46.530
it was pretty legendary and there were some pretty,
uh,

1174
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.790
pretty amazing moments during that time.
Uh,
but yeah,

1175
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:51.601
but you know,

1176
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.080
doing that stuff well he was also one of those guys where he had a lot of,

1177
01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.750
he liked having a lot of people around and you know,

1178
01:02:57.751 --> 01:03:00.990
he liked having a posy like having a group of guys and you know,

1179
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.870
it's just one of those situations where you're sitting around that shit and you

1180
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.290
really,
you know,
like someone could die and then a few seconds while you're like,

1181
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:14.700
could be me.
He is nobody who you know,
dies.

1182
01:03:14.701 --> 01:03:17.440
And it was terrible situations.
Thanks.
Today's the day.
No,

1183
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:21.450
with Kennison someone's going to drop dead here.
There was some dude one time,

1184
01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.220
he's still alive too.
Where like some dude after partying one night,

1185
01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:29.250
cause we were up at the house where that's where I was with him and they come

1186
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:32.030
party up there.
Some dude fucking,
you know,

1187
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:36.570
woke up in the morning and his car was fucking totaled and he had no

1188
01:03:36.571 --> 01:03:40.080
recollection of it.
He was like,
yeah,
I don't know what happened man.
I'm like,

1189
01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:41.550
well was it a school bus color?

1190
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:46.440
Explained her house for people don't know what the house was.
Well,
the house was,

1191
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:51.120
uh,
behind the comedy store.
Mitzi owned a small mansion that,

1192
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:53.190
um,
that she would rent out to comics.

1193
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:56.210
And at the time I was there like I was,

1194
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.340
I was the head doorman and I was driving her fucking truck.

1195
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:01.110
I was driving the jeep for her,

1196
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:04.650
which means I would have to take people to the airport so they could go do the

1197
01:04:04.651 --> 01:04:06.390
dunes.
She had a club at the,
uh,

1198
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.290
I believe that dunes and Degas and I'd also have to go get her Chinese chicken

1199
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:13.860
salad and I'd also have to run fucking errands.
I'm driving around in that cheap,

1200
01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.120
but I was also the head door guy and then she just let me live in the house.

1201
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.580
How old were you at the time?
21.
Wow.

1202
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:25.170
It was right when I left Boston that first time I graduated college.
Uh,
you know,

1203
01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:27.540
I took the summer at home.
I thought it was King Shit.

1204
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.510
I already had a pretty good coke habit going.
I thought it was the shit.

1205
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.970
Am I going to go out here?
And I auditioned for her.

1206
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:36.540
And then basically I lived at the comedy store for a little under a year.

1207
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:41.690
So she had that house.
I had dices old room,
but he used to come up like the,

1208
01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.000
I,
you know,
several people have lived there at the time I was there.
It was me,

1209
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.190
big fat Todd.
Did you know Todd at all?
Dot.
Todd?
Yeah.
The tod hooked me up,
man.

1210
01:04:50.191 --> 01:04:53.370
That's how I got into the comedy store.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think something broken.

1211
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:56.160
His brain broke.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
they,

1212
01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.120
and Jimmy Schubert was living there for a while and then one of the sound guys

1213
01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:03.860
was living there for a while to myo lived upstairs by lot.

1214
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:07.050
Suki and Sam used to go out with her so that he had a double,

1215
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.440
the reason why he would come up there and party was,
it would always,

1216
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.300
it got so fucking nuts,
dude.
Like I didn't know Sam.
And quite frankly,

1217
01:05:15.301 --> 01:05:18.070
when I first got out here,
I didn't really love his that much.
Yeah.

1218
01:05:18.071 --> 01:05:21.760
I didn't get it.
And then like I come out,
I become head doorman,

1219
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:25.300
Sam's out on the road somewhere.
I meet Carla Bove and he's like,

1220
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:28.110
so you're the new head door guy.
I'm like,
yeah.
And he goes,
I used to,
you know,

1221
01:05:28.111 --> 01:05:30.610
we used to do that.
Me and Sam and like,
and I had no idea.

1222
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.300
Like you know the store,
you know,
I,
you know,
there's mythologies that happened,

1223
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.730
there's people that are dug in there and I come out of nowhere.

1224
01:05:36.731 --> 01:05:41.350
I had no idea about this sort of mythology or what do's people paid or what a

1225
01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:44.470
door guy,
men,
I didn't know the way it worked.
And he was like,

1226
01:05:44.471 --> 01:05:46.150
we were had door guys.
I like you man.

1227
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.630
And then he gives me his watch and I'm like,
why are you giving me your watch?

1228
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.400
And he's like,
I want you to have that man.

1229
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:54.670
It's just an act of a brotherhood or whatever.
Some weird bullshit.
I'm like,

1230
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:58.120
now what's happening?
You know,
Sam's got to meet you when he comes in,
you know,

1231
01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:01.840
you,
you got my watch.
So you've got the stamp of approval,
what is happening,

1232
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.270
you know?
Then Sam comes and then,
you know,

1233
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:07.510
I got to go one on one with him for a night doing blow and that was fucking

1234
01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:11.860
crazy.
I,
I've told that story before.
It never to you,
but that was crazy.

1235
01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.980
How much blow was he doing with like an eight ball and night or do you even know

1236
01:06:14.981 --> 01:06:18.260
how much he was?
You know,
it was unclear.
Not unlike best deal.
Like,
you know,

1237
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:19.840
whatever was going on with Sam.

1238
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:23.980
Like I came into town right when he was about to break big.
All right.

1239
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.220
So I didn't like,
I grew to really appreciate his comedy,
you know,

1240
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:32.230
he became very clear that like I'll still listen to that first record like once

1241
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:34.410
or twice a year rather than hell.
Yeah.

1242
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.120
Which you can't even get on CD for reasons I don't fucking understand.

1243
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:40.540
The Warner brothers,
people didn't like the fact that it was so homophobic.

1244
01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.500
It was like what was resistant?
They didn't want to put it on CD.
Really?
Yeah,

1245
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.020
that's what I heard.
That's what I heard about people worked at Warner brothers,

1246
01:06:47.021 --> 01:06:50.740
but that it seems like if the music,
if the music is x,
can make money,

1247
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.990
they'll generally make,
when they've put out homophobic,

1248
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:56.470
somebody apparently put the Kibosh on that.
The Chi Bosch on it.
Well,

1249
01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:59.890
you can rip it.
I got to be bullshit.
Somebody ripped it.
Well,
yeah,

1250
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.560
but I mean there was some,
a couple of wrong minded jokes on there.

1251
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:05.050
There's no question about that.
But you know,

1252
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.440
there's also some fucking masterpieces on there.
Oh No,
look,
it's amazing.

1253
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.310
But I heard this when I was,
I had a deal at Warner brothers.

1254
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.220
My first CD was there.
Yeah.
So I talked to people who work there.

1255
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:18.250
So you'll never see it on CD.
Dick,
Dick,
Dick Suck.
Suck,
Suck Dick.

1256
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:22.210
They must have been that last fucking dig.
Yeah,
yeah.
I think,
uh,

1257
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.690
for a year he was the greatest comic cover.
That's right.
I'll give it that.

1258
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:29.350
That's,
I think that's right.
And I was there during that.
That's amazing.
So,

1259
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.360
but like I was there the night,
his HBO special aired.

1260
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:39.340
Wow.
I was there at the party at Carl at Bo's house when that first one,

1261
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:42.040
the one where he was good.
Yeah.
Like I was at,

1262
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.660
I was in the main room when he was working out that homosexual necrophilia joke.

1263
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.840
Wow.
Which was spectacular to watch,

1264
01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.080
spectacular to watch because the thing that people forget about him is that he

1265
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:59.920
was very aware of,
of how he did comedy,
you know,
he knew like,

1266
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:04.100
Eh,
and I told,
I told,
I talked about that with Mel Brooks.
Dude,
I,

1267
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:07.600
you know,
like Steve Pearl put it very succinctly,
you know,

1268
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:11.560
Steve pro was sort of a genius and,
and still is sort of a genius.
But uh,

1269
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:14.610
like I remember one time like he was like,
I'm like,

1270
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.990
cause you stuck in that we were stuck up at the house and Becker who used to be

1271
01:08:17.991 --> 01:08:22.550
Mitsis assistant used to call us the Manson family because you have Sam,

1272
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:26.630
what he would do or what's you want to hear the whole story.
Yeah.

1273
01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.390
The first time I met Sam,
you know,
he,
you know,
he shows up and you know,

1274
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:34.160
you could sort of feel that guy come in like,
you know,

1275
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:35.950
Monday nights where his night,
there was no cover nights.

1276
01:08:35.951 --> 01:08:37.190
So all the way it was chaos here.

1277
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.610
Like all the rooms were free and every fucking freak in the world would converge

1278
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:44.770
on the comedy store.
All the porn stars,
all the fucking people from the Roxy,
the,

1279
01:08:44.771 --> 01:08:46.100
the rockers would come down.

1280
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.370
It was just electric with insanity because that was his night.

1281
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:53.840
He would come to the main room on Monday at about 11 o'clock and just fucking do

1282
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:56.120
his thing.
And that's sort of where that shit started.
I mean,

1283
01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:58.610
you've got a little of that,
you know,
with the special spots,

1284
01:08:58.611 --> 01:09:02.870
the hour spots where,
you know,
you kind of were able to kind of rule the right,

1285
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.900
the store.
That sort of started I think with him.

1286
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:10.430
So the first time I met him,
you know,
he's like,
Carlos says,
you're all right.

1287
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.460
I'm like,
yeah,
I got,
we're in the launch

1288
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.450
and we'd go up to Cresto cause I was living up there.
And it's just me and Sam.

1289
01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.170
And he starts putting out the lines,
you know,
and I'm like,
all right,
I'm fucking,

1290
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:28.820
I'm,
I can do this,
man.
I can fucking,
oh,
we're fucking doing Sam's coke.

1291
01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:31.820
And he's telling me,
you know,
he's telling me the history of Sam.

1292
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.160
And he was saying,
he said this a lot.
He said,

1293
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:36.130
it looked me in the eye and Marin look me in the eye and Marin,

1294
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.860
I don't trust a man,
can't look me in the eye.
And I'm like,
okay,
I'm looking,

1295
01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:43.340
you know,
we're doing blow.
And then at some point he's like,
you ever burn money?

1296
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.640
And like,
I know now he's like,
yeah,
you should burn money.

1297
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.900
And he pulls out this money,

1298
01:09:47.901 --> 01:09:50.410
starts pulling out hundred dollar bills and we just start burning his money.

1299
01:09:50.411 --> 01:09:52.680
So it feels pretty good.
I'm like,
as long as it's not my money.

1300
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.340
So then,
uh,
you know,
we run out of coke at about three 30 in the morning.

1301
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:01.550
We're fucking,
you know,
loaded.
And we're also drunk.
I mean he,
you know,

1302
01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:05.780
he would Busan,
you know,
one thing coke gets you is a lot more drinking time,

1303
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:09.380
but you don't really realize how much you've drank.
You know,
so you can actually,

1304
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.830
no matter how much coke you do,
once the alcohol catches up,
you're fucked.

1305
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.340
You know,
cause now the coke is not even letting you drink more.
So you're pretty,

1306
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:21.030
you're like in a blackout,
cause your body like from alcohol,
we'll black out,

1307
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:25.820
but the cocoa keep you fucking going,
but you're just gone.
You know.
So he's like,

1308
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.090
you know,
we gotta get more coke.
And I'm like,
I don't,
I don't know,
wouldn't it?

1309
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:31.520
I don't know anybody.
So like,
no,
we'll go,
we'll go.
So he's like,
yeah,

1310
01:10:31.521 --> 01:10:34.750
you're driving though.
And I'm like,
fuck.
Okay.
So right.

1311
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.320
So it's like three 30 in the morning,

1312
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.340
he gets in my Toyota and we're driving down sunset to Creston heights.

1313
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.310
We just take a right on crescent heights and pull into this apartment building.

1314
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:47.030
And like on the way over there,
Sam's like passing out and you know,

1315
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:49.670
and he looks at me and he goes,
he wakes up really quick and he goes,

1316
01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:53.460
I don't even know you man.
You can fucking kill me.
And I'm like,
just skull.

1317
01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:55.310
It just,
where are we going?
You know?
So,

1318
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:03.290
so we get to this dude's house and we get to the apartment,
you know,

1319
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:06.590
and he rings.
Now here's some tire dude.
Go what?
And he's like it,
Sam,

1320
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:08.130
we're coming up.
You got a,

1321
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:12.140
so we go up and we knock on this door and this dude in a bathrobe opens he and

1322
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:15.180
he's got long hair.
I've seen this dude since,
I don't wanna mention his name,

1323
01:11:15.181 --> 01:11:18.270
but he's okay.
This guy,
it turns out he was a hairdresser during the day,

1324
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:21.790
but he sold to him coke.
You know,
he's got this long curly hair permed.

1325
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:25.210
We'll mustaches that dude.
And he's in his fucking bathrobe and Samsung,
wait,

1326
01:11:25.211 --> 01:11:27.780
when needed some blow and the guys would be careful,

1327
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.420
just be call I had my roommates.
We've been,
was that situation.
So now,

1328
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:34.380
like we go into this guy's bedroom and seems like you got any booze and the guy

1329
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:38.460
all,
for some reason,
all he had was miniatures from the airport and the airplane.

1330
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:42.660
So it gives him a,
like a miniature smear enough in Sam just sits on the floor,

1331
01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.360
little fat Kennison drinking out of this little smear and off bottle.

1332
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:48.720
It was very endearing.
You look like a giant.
He's just like this.

1333
01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.620
And then fucking San passes out and I don't know,

1334
01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:57.330
this dude in Sam's fucking on his floor blacked out,
fucking done.
And I'm like,

1335
01:11:57.331 --> 01:12:00.930
oh,
well I guess I'm going to take off.
He's like,
no,
you're fucking not.
I'm not,

1336
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:03.810
he can't pull a Belushi on me,
man.
Get him the fuck Outta here.
I'm like,

1337
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:06.270
well this is a friendship.
Yeah.
So like,
you know,

1338
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:10.380
this guy's just like fucking get them out.
So of course of those Sam you'd get,

1339
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:12.640
I don't know him at all.
And I'm like,
all,

1340
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:14.700
and then he gives me the blow and I'm like,
all right.

1341
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:18.600
So I wake Sam up and I'd fucking walk them out to my car and then I'm walking

1342
01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:21.160
back into the house and he just passes out on the floor,

1343
01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:24.810
Crest Hill in front of the fireplace,
slept on the floor,
face down on the floor.

1344
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.130
And,
and I thought it was bizarre because I'm like,
Eh,

1345
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:30.090
what do I just leave him there?
Whatever.
And then I did some coke by myself.

1346
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:33.930
And so,
but the thing was is that he used to do that a lot.

1347
01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:35.850
Like he liked to sweep on the ground.

1348
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.280
Like he would sweep on the floor up there a lot.

1349
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.890
And he apparently he swept at home,
uh,
on the ground too.

1350
01:12:40.891 --> 01:12:45.810
But that was the first time I met him.
That was the first time we hung out.

1351
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:49.830
<v 0>That's an awesome story.
Yeah.
But then it gets all ugly.
Joe.
Well,</v>

1352
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.860
here's a lot of ugly with Kinison and,
and my opinion,

1353
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:56.490
although [inaudible] was the best ever for,
like I said,
like I said,
for a year,

1354
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:01.790
he also is the best ever example of a guy who lost everything is as far as his

1355
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:07.860
ability.
He was genius.
And then fucking terrible.

1356
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:09.960
If you look at like his later stuff,

1357
01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:13.500
the stuff that he did after louder than hell.
[inaudible] album was not great.

1358
01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:15.880
And then it fell apart after that.
It got in the way.

1359
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.040
<v 2>He always wanted to be a rock star.
That guy,
he too.</v>

1360
01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:22.250
We used to sit up there in that house.
Pearl was so great.
He used to go,

1361
01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.170
I used to go,
you want to come hang out?
He's like,
what?

1362
01:13:24.171 --> 01:13:27.860
And listened to how salmon vented paper and the printing press and grabbing,

1363
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:32.750
<v 0>well you know,
did you ever read his book?
His brother's book?</v>

1364
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:33.723
[inaudible] my brothers.

1365
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.390
It's interesting cause he said that Sam was hit by a car when he was a little

1366
01:13:38.391 --> 01:13:41.150
kid and completely changed his personality.

1367
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.530
So he's like Sam Walton and Sam to sort of,
you know,
the model of Earth,
Earth,

1368
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.980
Warren Earth too.
And the earth was actually hit by another planet.
Yeah.
Which,
uh,

1369
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:50.630
may may have created our moon,

1370
01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:53.270
but certainly if you're saying the earth got hit by a planet and made it angry,

1371
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.230
it made it the earth,
the earth we exist on today.

1372
01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:00.310
Whereas Kennison there was Kinison one and can listen to it.

1373
01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:02.330
It was Kennison and then Kennison hit by a car,

1374
01:14:02.331 --> 01:14:05.060
completely different person afterwards.
And this is a,

1375
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:08.450
what else can I say is this is an issue that a friend is going through because

1376
01:14:08.451 --> 01:14:11.800
their son was hit by a car.
You know a guy.
Yes.
Okay.

1377
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:16.720
Hit by a car when he's on a motorcycle and he got fucked up and some traumatic

1378
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:20.550
brain injuries and he's totally different person now and the family is

1379
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.680
struggling with it.
They don't really know exactly how to deal with it.
You know,

1380
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:27.730
you're dealing with a guy who was one way and then an event happens and all of a

1381
01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:32.380
sudden you have this weird,
aggressive,
strange,
reckless person.

1382
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.810
<v 2>But he was also like,
um,
the,
the fascinating thing about him and like,
you know,
I,</v>

1383
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:39.390
I've never told you these stories and you know,
some of these stories,

1384
01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:40.080
but you know,

1385
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.080
was that he was very aware of,

1386
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.480
of what he was trying to do that,
you know,

1387
01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:52.700
he was a guy that was gunning for,
you know,
uh,
uh,

1388
01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.800
Jim Baker's wife.
He was a guy that you know,

1389
01:14:55.801 --> 01:15:00.030
comes from a family of ministers and what his dream was a satellite station,

1390
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:01.110
you know,
a theme park.

1391
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:04.980
Like he wanted to be one of those type of preachers that had a global

1392
01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:09.981
congregation and mega million dollar business a doing preaching.

1393
01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:14.550
That's what he wanted to do.
That was the trajectory he was on.

1394
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.620
And there's a fascinating thing if you know,

1395
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:19.140
if anyone could get hold of this because he would play them occasionally if he

1396
01:15:19.141 --> 01:15:23.690
went to his house out in Malibu where when he was started doing comedy in,

1397
01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:26.820
in Houston where you know,

1398
01:15:26.821 --> 01:15:30.450
he was still preaching and he had a lot of pressure from his family to continue

1399
01:15:30.451 --> 01:15:34.020
preaching.
But he was compelled towards this to,
to,
to,
to,

1400
01:15:34.021 --> 01:15:37.580
to comedy and to play music.
And there's like,
there's the,

1401
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.010
I don't know what the story was with when he and the original outlaws came out

1402
01:15:41.011 --> 01:15:43.080
when he and Carl came out or who was involved in that.

1403
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.040
And then bill came out later when he was like a teenager and,

1404
01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.990
and all that stuff and they had their falling out.

1405
01:15:47.991 --> 01:15:49.290
I don't know the details of that,

1406
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:53.040
but I do know that when he was out here and things weren't working out

1407
01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:57.710
comedically,
like he went back home and actually preached like his,
uh,

1408
01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.770
his family got him up on the pulpit and he preached and he played this sermon,

1409
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:06.960
which was really about like,
you know,
like losing his guitar and like,
you know,

1410
01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:08.840
like you could hear him struggling,
you know,

1411
01:16:08.841 --> 01:16:11.520
trying to hold the faith and wondering whether or not he,
you know,

1412
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:14.730
he still had God on his side or whether or not he could still preach.

1413
01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:19.170
Like it was one of these weird sermons where he was obviously struggling with

1414
01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:21.810
the idea that,
you know,
he was now living this other life.

1415
01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.550
And so he built this character that,
you know,
I think that quite honestly,

1416
01:16:26.551 --> 01:16:30.240
if I think back on it,
that he was going to Diff,

1417
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:33.480
I don't think he ever lost his faith in Jesus ever.

1418
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.910
And I think that like in his mind,

1419
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.630
that he was going to embody and comedically that his clown,

1420
01:16:39.631 --> 01:16:40.860
which he called the beast,

1421
01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.410
was going to push as hard as he could against God.
Knowing that,

1422
01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:49.940
you know,
if he had a second at the end,
he could still get in the,

1423
01:16:49.941 --> 01:16:54.720
you know what I mean?
Like if you asked for forgiveness at the end,
at the door,

1424
01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:58.560
that you can still get in.
Like it was always sort of a question of mine.

1425
01:16:58.561 --> 01:17:02.430
Like whether or not he turned his back on God,
but I don't think he ever,

1426
01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.250
like he was a guy,
I knew the Bible inside out.
You know,
he could like,

1427
01:17:05.251 --> 01:17:07.800
he could turn on the preacher thing,
like the,

1428
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:12.140
if you listened to his cadence and you listened to classic Baptist preaching it,

1429
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.260
you know,
he knew how to do it and you hear these tapes of him preaching,

1430
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:20.460
he was fucking great at it.
And like,
this is what I told him.
I'll Brooks cause I,

1431
01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:21.800
and I think it will blow you away.

1432
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:25.050
And I don't think it's like a secret and I don't have to necessarily honor a

1433
01:17:25.051 --> 01:17:29.360
dead man secrets,
but you don't like,
you know,
you'd sit there with him and he,

1434
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:31.810
you know,
you'd sit around these tables with him doing blow and he'd,

1435
01:17:31.811 --> 01:17:34.160
he'd look at you,
I'm to save you some time,
man.

1436
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.620
I'm going to take care of you man.
I'm going to get you,
you know,

1437
01:17:36.621 --> 01:17:39.830
I'm going to take eight years off of your dues,
you know,
by hanging out with me.

1438
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.380
You know,
Geez,
we just swipe feeds you this bullshit.

1439
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:45.620
And he had that charisma of a preacher so he wanted to be around them cause it

1440
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:47.120
was like electric,
you know,
to be,

1441
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.960
have the attention of that dude was pretty electric and to have the coke was

1442
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.960
twice as electric.
But you know,
I'm a kid.

1443
01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.750
I'm 2122 but I can remember one night I was like,

1444
01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:59.300
well why don't you fucking figure it out?
I used to get up his ass,

1445
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.610
like I used to just poke him and poke him and poke him.

1446
01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:05.150
Like there was one time where everyone was hanging out and I think I was

1447
01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:10.020
fighting it.
I needed to get out so I would do shit,
you know,
like,
like,

1448
01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.460
uh,
like it was one time,
there's like 12 people there and I'd be like,
Hey Sam,

1449
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:16.520
let's burn some money.
And He,
and because he was the beast,

1450
01:18:16.521 --> 01:18:20.240
he sorta had to do shit.
He'd be like,
no,
Fuck Marin contaminant.

1451
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.930
They start burning money in and he'd start to fucking get mad at me.

1452
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:24.890
And I always,

1453
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:28.460
I also knew that come like the second or third day you've been awake straight.

1454
01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.860
He had,
he had no ability.

1455
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.140
Like there was no valve between thought and action.
It just goes away.
You know,

1456
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.010
it's,
how many days was he stay up for?
Well,

1457
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.520
I know I did three with him a few times,
but like,
like dude,

1458
01:18:43.521 --> 01:18:46.630
it gets weird man.
Well,
it's three days awake.

1459
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.530
Like you don't leave the house and people come and go and you lose track of
time.

1460
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:53.720
And then like,
you know,
after you're up all night,
one night,

1461
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.710
then you go back down to the store and everything's fucking haunted.
I co I was,

1462
01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:01.160
the reason I left La dude was cause I got psychotic.

1463
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.540
It took me a year and a half.
I got psychotic.
Like,
you know,

1464
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:09.170
you do like,
you know,
you entertained conspiracy stuff,
you know,

1465
01:19:09.171 --> 01:19:13.130
like I was living,
I got fucked up man.

1466
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:14.900
I heard voices in my head.

1467
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.600
It took me a year and a half to get my brain back after that,

1468
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:23.570
a year and a half.
Oh my God.
It's like coke.
Well,

1469
01:19:23.571 --> 01:19:27.260
because what happens is you deprive yourself asleep.

1470
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.700
So you're on coke.
Yeah.
But you deprive yourself a sweep.
And like,

1471
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.000
I'd always had this thing in my head when I was a kid with drugs because I

1472
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:38.420
always thought of myself as sort of a drug warrior,
you know?
But I was,
you know,

1473
01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:41.210
pretty sensitive drug warrior.
Yeah.
I,
the,

1474
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:45.500
my heroes were never sports guys that were drugs.
Right.
So I,
you know,

1475
01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:47.450
I never wanted to boot,
you know,
I Never Bang Shit.

1476
01:19:47.451 --> 01:19:50.360
I never had since shot nothing,
but there's very few drugs.
I didn't try,

1477
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:52.970
but coke was the thing.
But there was a,
you know,

1478
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.810
I always had this idea in my head that like if I ever lose my mind,

1479
01:19:57.410 --> 01:20:01.400
that's what I'm going to,
I'm going to pull back like you would know.
Right.

1480
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:05.360
And there was this Tom McGuane quote,
he said,
the mind is not a boomerang.

1481
01:20:05.361 --> 01:20:09.780
If you throw it too far,
it will not come back.
Right.
So,
so

1482
01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:16.260
it's great.
He's a good writer,
that guy.
But um,
he's just a novelist.
But uh,

1483
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.980
so like,
so you're doing all this coke and you know,
the store's got that vibe.

1484
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.950
So I,
I'm in the darkest period of the store.

1485
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:27.030
Sam represents a store at its most insidious,
you know,

1486
01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.660
because he fed on the energy and like I'm doing all this coke and then I start

1487
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:33.330
to fucking like,
I start to fucking trip out.
You know,

1488
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:37.860
I start to see signs and symbols and things like I think I'm tapped into some

1489
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:41.370
like all right,
all right,
God's so whatever forces that are out there,

1490
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.380
they've got a plan for me cause I'm here.

1491
01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.510
I'm supposed to be making note of things.

1492
01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:47.610
Like at the time I was at the store that,

1493
01:20:47.611 --> 01:20:51.030
you know the hotel right across the street that a,
the sunset tower,

1494
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.330
that old decco hotel that was gutted when I was there.

1495
01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:57.570
So it was just this carcass of a building and on top you can see it,

1496
01:20:57.571 --> 01:21:01.530
there's an altar up there like a,
like a Greek sort of like alter looking thing.

1497
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:05.610
So I had it in my head.
It's like when they rebuild that that's going to be used.

1498
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.410
That at the end of the world is going to review.

1499
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:12.500
Like I was out there too out there and like fucking like I was,

1500
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.660
you know,
I would lay in bed cause you can't sweep on blow.

1501
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.110
Most of the dudes like I was never one of these dudes like somehow or another

1502
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:22.440
they all had fucking downers or maybe they were doing dope or whatever.
But no,

1503
01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:24.330
I never had no values that never had nothing.

1504
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:28.080
So those guys would go live their life and I'd be fucking in my closet,
you know,

1505
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:30.980
to,
you know,
hiding from them.
Like I got to the point where I,

1506
01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.290
I would sweep in the closet so I wouldn't have to go fucking party with these

1507
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:36.990
idiots.
And I was hearing voices in my head like,
you know,

1508
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.080
I wasn't even getting ready and I would just sit there like,
please make sense,

1509
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:44.430
give me some direction.
And uh,
so I was fucking out there man.

1510
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.570
And like ultimately what happened with the,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

1511
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.130
the,
the story about like,
I started like,

1512
01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:56.460
he never let me into the inner circle.
Thank fucking God.
Cause you know,

1513
01:21:56.461 --> 01:21:59.230
you look at the cats that were involved with that,
they didn't,
you know,

1514
01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.220
they didn't really pull out on their own that well.
So,
you know,

1515
01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:05.820
it's that were Mike Becker used to call them satellite comics that,
you know,

1516
01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:09.510
there were dudes that would rotate around dudes and you know,
they,
you know,

1517
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:13.590
and then they just sort of fall away,
but didn't know Hicks was a lone wolf,

1518
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.710
you know.
But that's why he left.
I don't know what their argument was about,

1519
01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:19.050
but Hicks was very young and I don't know what the beef was,
but he was,

1520
01:22:19.051 --> 01:22:23.190
he wasn't even 21.
I think that shit hit the fan and he went back to Houston.

1521
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:27.030
He was,
no,
he left.
I'm talking later,
you know,
and you know,

1522
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:30.930
most of the guys that were part of that,
um,
I ran into one of them in,

1523
01:22:30.931 --> 01:22:35.740
in Cleveland who was,
he's a lawyer now,
so he's out.
All right.

1524
01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:40.050
So one of those guys talked to him.
He might just sell to sell cars out.

1525
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:44.040
Uh,
but,
uh,
but what ultimately happened was I kept,
you know,

1526
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:47.790
like I did a couple of Bro,
you know,
this was the dude,
dude,
Shit.
I mean,

1527
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:50.970
this was serious fucking peck and Paul Shit with these guys.

1528
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:54.750
And it got very scary for a guy like me cause I'm not a fucking bro and I'm,

1529
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:57.810
you know,
and I'm not,
you know,
I'm kind of a pussy and I was the,

1530
01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:00.060
again with some fairly weird hardcore dudes,

1531
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:02.910
there used to be this dude that sold dope or coke at the store.

1532
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.120
And the story on him was that he was a,
an air of Arab descent.

1533
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:12.160
And the story,
uh,
about him was that,
uh,
like,
uh,

1534
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:14.030
like there was a couple stories like that.
He,

1535
01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.750
he fought against the Israelis in the,

1536
01:23:16.751 --> 01:23:21.610
in one of the wars as a Palestinian and that like he was also in nom,

1537
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:24.640
like thinking back on it couldn't be possible.

1538
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.380
But the story about him was that he was in nom and he was a,
you know,

1539
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:31.930
fighting for the Americans and he was on the ground and he needed to be

1540
01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:35.680
airlifted out because it was a hot zone and a chopper came down and they were

1541
01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:39.430
about to airlift him out,
but it was too hot and they were about to take off.

1542
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.750
The chopper was about to leave and this dude was on radio with the chopper and

1543
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:48.720
said,
well,
we've got you in,
in our sites,
so you decide what you want to do.
Right.

1544
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.440
You got you all right.
So you can leave,

1545
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:52.930
but we're going to take you out if you don't fucking pick us up.

1546
01:23:52.931 --> 01:23:57.190
So this was the mythology of that dude.
So he was around and uh,

1547
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.180
and like I was,

1548
01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:01.240
I'd done a couple of fucking things that I didn't even think about.

1549
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.000
It's a weird thing about paranoia and about,
you know,

1550
01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:09.060
scary guys like Carl had a wife who was kind of a nut bag and a,

1551
01:24:09.321 --> 01:24:12.190
I don't know if you've had Carl on,
but he's a great guest.
It's great guy.
No,

1552
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:14.980
I haven't had a mom,
very interesting story,
you know,
because you know,
his,

1553
01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:19.480
his wife had Sam's baby after he died.
So,
you know,
he's very,
you know,
into like,

1554
01:24:19.481 --> 01:24:22.680
you know,
sort of the sort of father's rights and you know,
he's active in,

1555
01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:24.430
you know,
in what happened with that.
You know,

1556
01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:28.690
cause he brought up that kid and it wasn't his and,
but whatever it was,
it,

1557
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:32.200
he told the story of my podcast.
But what,
like he,
here's what happened,

1558
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.470
here's the beginning of the meltdown and I'll tell you the whole story cause I

1559
01:24:35.471 --> 01:24:37.840
know your listeners haven't heard it and it's a pretty good story.

1560
01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:43.290
So I'm losing my fucking mind and I are already piss him off because I started

1561
01:24:43.301 --> 01:24:46.150
to like do shit,
you know,
like you have to burn,
burn money.

1562
01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:47.680
And then like one time,
you know,

1563
01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:51.040
like he had some chick over and there's a few people at the table and like it

1564
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:53.920
was like day three and this chick he was hanging out with was like,
you know,

1565
01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:59.500
broken mess of a junky girl.
And uh,
like I just remember like,
you know,

1566
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:02.220
I knew that things were getting weird and it was just there.

1567
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:03.220
It was about five of us.

1568
01:25:03.221 --> 01:25:07.240
And I put on this ACDC album really loud and Sam just fucking what?

1569
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.380
And he just throws this chicken on the table and starts making out with her and

1570
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:15.490
coke goes all over the place and people scatter.
And I was like,
so,

1571
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.650
so I was trying,
I was just pushing these buttons.
But uh,

1572
01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:22.810
you know what happened was like,
I remember this is what happened.

1573
01:25:22.811 --> 01:25:26.080
This was the creepiest moment cause it's,
it's sort of a real moment.

1574
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:30.100
Christy will bow or in Carla just bought a car,

1575
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:35.080
an rx seven and she went and picked the car up and for some reason is the middle

1576
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:35.170
of the day.

1577
01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:37.540
And I was in the parking lot of the comedy store cause I didn't know what the

1578
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:40.360
fuck to do with my life.
I would go down there and make coffee.

1579
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.530
I would listen to my new cds in the or because of the sound system was good.

1580
01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.251
I would literally,

1581
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:49.900
I lived at the fucking comedy store so I had to know where Christy Lipo dries up

1582
01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:52.770
in this new rx seven.
She goes,
how do you like my new,
my new car?

1583
01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.940
You want to take a ride?
I'm like,
yeah,
sure,
let's go.

1584
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.740
So we get high smoke some weed,

1585
01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.470
and you start driving around Mulholland drive all around.
I'm like,

1586
01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:01.180
this is fucking great.
It's fucking great.

1587
01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.550
And then she dropped me back off at the store.
Fine.
So like,

1588
01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.810
then later that night Carl shows up and he's fucking ice in me and he's like,

1589
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:12.320
fuck you.
And I'm like,
what's going on?
I don't know what's going on.

1590
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.440
You know what I mean?
You're so invested with a group where you like,

1591
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:19.040
what things are starting to break this?
These people are my life.
You know?

1592
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.070
And then like,
you know Carlos fucking ice and me,

1593
01:26:21.071 --> 01:26:24.440
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
And then Sam comes up later,
he shows up,

1594
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.650
pulls me out and do a parking lot.
He's got,
he's,
I'm like,

1595
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:30.290
what's going on with Carl man?
You know,
like this little kid.

1596
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:33.410
I was like a little kid and he puts his arm around me and he goes like,

1597
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:37.220
Hey Marin,
you never want to put them in a position where he has to trust you.

1598
01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.180
I call it the fuck is happening.
Am I in a cowboy movie?

1599
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.960
It's actually really good advice.
It is very good advice.
But the point was it,

1600
01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:48.110
nothing happened.
But that shit went back to him and said,

1601
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:51.530
I am me and Mark Marin cause car.
That's what Carl said.
He comes out and he goes,

1602
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.900
how'd you like my car?
I haven't even written in it yet.
Right.

1603
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:59.580
That was it.
I have even written any yet.
Yeah,
we just drove up.
Yeah,

1604
01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:04.940
I haven't really nice car.
And I'm like fuck.
And then Sam gave me that rap.
Right.

1605
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:09.020
So now all of a sudden I'm like this 21 year old comic fucked up on blow and now

1606
01:27:09.021 --> 01:27:11.630
you've got these fucking,
you know cowboys mad at me.

1607
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:16.620
You know what it'd be like,
what the fuck is happening?
So,

1608
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:19.320
oh,
but the,

1609
01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:22.880
the notorious story about the urinating on the bed thing.

1610
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:28.400
Sam was weird with his Dick and peeing on things.
You know,
like

1611
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:33.320
everyone at the comedy store is weird with her.
Dixit seems like,
yeah,
way.

1612
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:37.280
I think it's a comic thing.
Maybe be dicks out,
whatever.
Show it to people.
Yeah.

1613
01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:40.910
More Dixon been pulled out at the comedy store than any of us for no reason.

1614
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.820
Look at my Dick.
Yeah.
But,
uh,
the fucker peed on your bed.

1615
01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.230
Right.
But like,

1616
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:52.160
he was already mad at me cause that fucking crazy chick that he was with,
like,

1617
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.460
I just didn't know better.
Like,
you know the ride,
you know,

1618
01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:58.480
theoretically maybe I shouldn't have gotten that car,
but you were 21 right?

1619
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:00.920
You didn't know any better.
And then like this chick,
you know,

1620
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:02.990
like this crazy junkie chick,
that same Lucien,

1621
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.650
like she shows up at the House one day up at Crest Hill and she's like,
you know,

1622
01:28:06.651 --> 01:28:10.130
Sam said we'd come help me move my stuff over here in,

1623
01:28:10.131 --> 01:28:11.930
Sam's going to pick me up later.
I'm like,
alright,

1624
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:14.720
so I drive this chick down to fucking Hollywood boulevard.

1625
01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:18.630
I don't know where the Ng this fucking,
you know,
SRO,
she brings,

1626
01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:22.970
brings out a bunch of shit and I bring it over to the house and then like,

1627
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:27.380
you know,
Sam's got to deal with this and uh,
in San,
well,
you know,

1628
01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:29.810
after that went down,
he's like,
yeah,
thanks a lot.
And that's,
yeah,

1629
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.950
it's exactly what I needed was to fucking,
yeah.
Thanks buddy.

1630
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.020
Now I've got that fucking chicken,
my house.
Right.

1631
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:39.410
So I don't fucking know this stuff.
I'm way I believe people.
So,
uh,

1632
01:28:39.411 --> 01:28:44.411
so she had you move her in the Sam's basically she put me in a position to our

1633
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:47.360
God to wear it.
Like I didn't know where Sam lived at that time,

1634
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:49.900
but I brought the shit over to Crest Hill.
Oh God.
Right.

1635
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:54.980
So the peeing on the bed thing.
So by now,

1636
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:57.140
like as you're going in between the Carl thing and you know,

1637
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:00.530
don't want to put them in a position where men have guys to trust you.

1638
01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:04.230
And then that chick thing and this and that burning money.
Yeah,
he was,

1639
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:07.530
he'd had enough of me because I was kept,
you know,

1640
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:12.540
fucking Pocono and getting in trouble.
And,
uh,
but the,
the fucking,

1641
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:16.370
the greatest thing was in part of me really loved this because there's,
if,

1642
01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.340
if I have one fault and it's surprising I have not gotten my ass kicked is that

1643
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:22.200
I love making fucking,
you know,

1644
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:26.820
angry control freak lunatics lose their shit that I,

1645
01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.670
there's something about poking a dude that,
you know,

1646
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:33.890
like it was it also that he was the king and it was like,
you know,

1647
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:35.860
was a person who grew up low.

1648
01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:39.070
You just sort of had to like define yourself in your own world and you see

1649
01:29:39.071 --> 01:29:42.100
everyone following this guy.
You're like,
oh come on man.
But it wasn't,

1650
01:29:42.101 --> 01:29:44.710
but he didn't have followers because he was a dark motherfucker.

1651
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.670
There were a lot of people,

1652
01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:48.940
like I remember one time a chick who I went out with in college came to visit me

1653
01:29:48.941 --> 01:29:50.950
in La and we were doing this shit.

1654
01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:54.490
We out with jam was out of town but we were all doing blow and staying up all

1655
01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:56.170
night and you know,
like you know,
like,

1656
01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.590
and I was sitting there saying like getting into said,
isn't this amazing?

1657
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.070
Look at how this is how fucking we live.
Man,
isn't this great?

1658
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.150
Look at those fucking saps out there that,
that don't know how to live in.

1659
01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:11.100
This woman goes home after seeing this in Saturday and she writes me later,

1660
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:14.080
she said,
look,
I don't know what you're thinking,
but you know,

1661
01:30:14.081 --> 01:30:17.530
most people don't want to live what?
You know what it'd be.

1662
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:21.280
And I never thought about it like that.
I'm like,
fucking,
we're living,
you know,

1663
01:30:21.281 --> 01:30:23.620
you're a comic too.
And to be a comic,

1664
01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:28.670
like does that rock and roll sort of lifestyle aspect to it that it's celebrated

1665
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.460
too crazy and wild.
But he wasn't just the king.

1666
01:30:31.461 --> 01:30:35.640
He was clearly doing something that no one had done before.
Standup wise.
Yeah.

1667
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:39.410
And,
and that like,
you know,
and,
and,
and I was the darkness,

1668
01:30:39.411 --> 01:30:40.730
he was able to make funny.
I mean,

1669
01:30:40.731 --> 01:30:43.360
the one thing you forget about that people forgetting,
I don't,

1670
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.630
I think he gets short shrift.

1671
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.500
I don't think he gets the respect that he deserves as an amazing standup nick.

1672
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:53.330
Not only because of the homophobic thing or,
or,
or the misogyny necessarily,

1673
01:30:53.331 --> 01:30:55.340
but just because he lived too,
too long.

1674
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.820
Like if he had died after that first record,
oh yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

1675
01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:01.580
Drink status.
But like,
you know,
he was,

1676
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.100
he was taking subjects that were specifically difficult and,

1677
01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:08.660
and loaded and pushing them to the,
to the,

1678
01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:13.040
pushing the envelope with them into a realm of funny that I don't think anybody

1679
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:16.310
ever did.
Like,
you know,
specifically like the Manson joke,

1680
01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:19.670
the homosexual necrophilia joke,
you know,
just,
uh,
I think,
uh,

1681
01:31:19.671 --> 01:31:20.870
what's that guy's name?
Bob.

1682
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.710
Some writer said something very intuitive about him.

1683
01:31:24.711 --> 01:31:29.711
He said that Kennison gave a voice to the broken hearted man that like,

1684
01:31:29.721 --> 01:31:32.540
you know,
his whole anger at,
you know,
uh,
about,
you know,

1685
01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:35.180
women or whatever that there was,
it was,

1686
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.620
he just pushed the envelope and it was interesting to be around somebody that

1687
01:31:39.621 --> 01:31:43.160
was really like pushing the envelope.
Yeah.
I could imagine.
I mean,

1688
01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:45.950
this is how good the homosexual necrophilia arc joke was.

1689
01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.540
I didn't hear it from him.

1690
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:51.230
I heard it from a friend of mine was working at the Boston Athletic Club in

1691
01:31:51.231 --> 01:31:54.380
South Boston and a girl who was working the front desk,

1692
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:57.320
just a friend of mine and not a girl I was dating.
She was like,

1693
01:31:57.321 --> 01:32:00.340
you have to see this community.
And he's so funny.
Oh my God,
he does this joke.

1694
01:32:00.341 --> 01:32:02.930
So she's out in the parking lot going,
oh,

1695
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:06.490
you mean live keeps fucking in the ass even after your dad and your friends.

1696
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.460
And I was laughing so hard at her doing my impression of this comedian.

1697
01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.220
I was like 19 yeah,
that bit was fucking insane.
It's insane.
It was so good.

1698
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.920
And there was nothing like it before that.
That's what people have to understand.

1699
01:32:17.921 --> 01:32:21.760
Like you could see a guy like Louis C k doing a joke like that today,

1700
01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.800
but when you're talking about 1986 there was nothing like that before.

1701
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:31.300
It was,
it was completely revolutionary.
He was menacing,
dude.
I mean like,

1702
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:31.481
you know,

1703
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:35.500
this is the dude that would get on stage with this disposition and just this

1704
01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:40.501
weird intensity and it was like sexually charged and angrily charged.

1705
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:44.680
And it was fucking pure rock and roll bullshit.
And people would just,
uh,

1706
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:48.510
like I remember working the door at those fucking nights on Monday and you know,

1707
01:32:48.511 --> 01:32:51.010
and trying to pull rank on these fucking freaks,
it would show up.

1708
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:53.800
I remember one time there was some dudes sitting right up front that I didn't

1709
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:56.890
seek their,
you know,
this is a long haired dude waiting for Sam.

1710
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:00.280
And I went up to him and I said,
you know,
you can't sit here.

1711
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.870
And this dude turned around and he shot Satan into my face.
He was like,

1712
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:09.280
I think I'm just going to sit here.
And I'm like,
I think you are too.
You know,

1713
01:33:09.281 --> 01:33:12.970
like,
you know,
he was all fucking cranked out and I was like,
all right dude.

1714
01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:17.900
Yeah,
you go ahead and sit there bed,
the same world guys.
Right.

1715
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:22.060
But the two things I want to tell you was that like one of those nights,

1716
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:23.350
and this is going to be kind of jarring,

1717
01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:24.880
but I think it's the most beautiful thing.

1718
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:27.780
One of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in comedy was,
you know,

1719
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:31.030
one of those nights I was,
you know,
poking it,
Sam,
like,
how'd you do it man?

1720
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:33.730
How'd you figure out?
Like,
how'd you figure out your thing?

1721
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.200
That was always my big question.
Like,

1722
01:33:35.201 --> 01:33:38.550
I remember one time I was in a car with Jimmy Miller,
uh,
Dennis,

1723
01:33:38.551 --> 01:33:42.550
his brother and Janeane Garofalo in Boston because I was still that guy.

1724
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:44.020
By the time I got to the Boston,
I was still like,

1725
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.520
how did he fucking figure it out?

1726
01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:48.970
And I remember it was flooded with Jimmy because,
you know,

1727
01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:51.940
I was driving them somewhere because he was in town scouting something and he's

1728
01:33:51.941 --> 01:33:55.990
a big manager.
And I was like,
uh,
how'd you,
your brother figured it out?
I mean,

1729
01:33:55.991 --> 01:34:00.550
how did he get his voice and fucking Gibby?
Gloria goes,
he's doing Belzer,

1730
01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:06.790
right?
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1731
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:11.280
I thought that was hilarious.
Elzer with a bigger vocabulary.
So,
well,
so anyways,

1732
01:34:11.281 --> 01:34:13.750
so I'm riding Kennison about it and like where'd you go?
What is it,

1733
01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:17.110
what's the fucking key?
Give me the key if you're the fucking wizard,
you know,

1734
01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:21.190
give me the fucking truth.
Give me the key.
How'd you figure out your thing?

1735
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:26.320
And he looked at me and he goes,
gene wilder.
And I'm like,

1736
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:30.850
what now if you watched any wilder when he's younger,
how he builds.

1737
01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:34.260
Like is it [inaudible]

1738
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.100
like it?
He was able to watch gene wilder,
like watchmen,

1739
01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:43.000
young Frankenstein as is.
And then there was an amazing,

1740
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:46.600
the way he works up like just his,

1741
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:52.110
the escalation of his delivery is what Kennison saw as the way to build.

1742
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:57.620
I mean,
obviously the screaming at the end was his own thing,
but if you,
you know,

1743
01:34:57.621 --> 01:35:01.280
even like there's a little bit in Willy Wonka,
there's some in the producers,

1744
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:05.250
but you watch wilder do his sing like God,
Eh.

1745
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.950
And I'm like,
holy fuck.
So that's gene Wilder's drive shaft.
That's hilarious.

1746
01:35:11.951 --> 01:35:13.040
That's fucking insane.

1747
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.970
Well that's some of the important things for young comics and knows that we all

1748
01:35:16.971 --> 01:35:20.330
sort of copy each other somehow or some way along the way.

1749
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.460
Of course there was times when I was young,

1750
01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.510
there was one time when I was on stage at stitches where I heard myself doing

1751
01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:31.340
Richard,
Jenny,
like I heard Richard Jenny come out of my own mouth making it.

1752
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.660
Yeah.
It was like stop thinking it.
You become that for a minute.
Yeah.
There,

1753
01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.350
there are times where you have to shake your,

1754
01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:39.050
like even there's some times where you do like,

1755
01:35:39.051 --> 01:35:40.910
you can just like all of a sudden you'll do on a towel.

1756
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:45.260
Like what there's a beat or you know,
you just,

1757
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.600
it's almost like you're taking,
you have to fight it.

1758
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:51.080
It's like you have to fight those out of you,
especially in the beginning.

1759
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:55.130
Fuck yeah,
dude.
I mean in it because what you're,
you're influence.

1760
01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:59.210
You Watch people and that's a delivery system that works.
Yeah.
So in your mind,

1761
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:02.270
as you're finding your voice,
you'll find you're all of a sudden like,
oh my God,

1762
01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:05.060
it's not my delivery system or your,
or you build on it.

1763
01:36:05.061 --> 01:36:06.380
Like you look at Geraldo's stuff.

1764
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.790
Like there was a period when Geraldo was really doing a tells cadence and then

1765
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:14.710
he built out of it.
Some people do.
Todd Barry,
you know like you know Hicks,

1766
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.900
what you had to,
you watch Hicks,
you if you were a Hicks Fan.

1767
01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:21.180
I had to stop watching him because it's,

1768
01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.570
it's so contagious.
Especially after he died.
Yeah,
yeah.

1769
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:29.070
It was charged.
Yeah,
like an electrical storm.

1770
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:34.130
You got to the point like with everything and also just vigilance in general

1771
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.860
that one of the reasons I started,

1772
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:39.920
you stop talking about politics and almost stopped talking about everything but

1773
01:36:39.921 --> 01:36:44.380
myself was because I didn't ever want,
you're like,
you know,
you get you,

1774
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:47.060
you know in your life,
you're like,
well you crushed dreams here.
Like,
you know,

1775
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:49.520
I'm doing a bit like that.
You're going a bit like that.
And then you're like,

1776
01:36:49.521 --> 01:36:51.590
why I don't want to do that bit anymore.
So I'm like,
well,

1777
01:36:51.591 --> 01:36:55.550
if I only talk about me,
I won't enter that fucking conversation.
Right.

1778
01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:59.090
That's true.
It's stupid funny.
It gets a little self involved.

1779
01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.441
But it's funny though,

1780
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:04.020
but that way you avoid all the pitfalls of on originality or,
or,

1781
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:07.190
or everyone's drawing from the same God damn pool.

1782
01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:10.040
Especially when there's like critical issues that everyone discusses.

1783
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:15.080
Corruption and politics,
no Yada Yada.
Now between Twitter and everything else,

1784
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:18.470
I mean,
you know,
every,
it's,
it's,
you're going to be,
it's going to be,

1785
01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:22.070
you're going to be hard pressed yet to find a take that somebody,

1786
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.740
obviously you have a stage and everything else and you're going to take it

1787
01:37:24.741 --> 01:37:27.560
further,
whatever you're going to do.
And you know,
it's a different world,

1788
01:37:27.561 --> 01:37:31.910
but it's now the,
the hive mind is so on top of us,

1789
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:37.760
it becomes difficult then the vigilance necessary.
I mean,
you don't fuck it.

1790
01:37:37.761 --> 01:37:40.700
It's just like I just try to keep it on me and I'm tired of it in a way.

1791
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.710
Like I just did a special for Netflix

1792
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:48.620
that's going to come out in July and it's all personal,
you know,
in,

1793
01:37:48.621 --> 01:37:51.170
in whatever it's called,
alternative comedy.
I mean,

1794
01:37:51.171 --> 01:37:54.020
storytelling is storytelling and people talk about,
you know,
their life,

1795
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.880
but like there's,
pardon me,
like I kind of Miss,

1796
01:37:57.570 --> 01:38:02.430
you'll having public opinions on things.
Did it just have him then just have no,

1797
01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:05.880
no,
I do,
I do.
But it's sort of like,
I like,
you know,

1798
01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:09.540
being philosophical and being personal and I think it's a lot more organic for

1799
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:10.860
me.
And I think that,
you know,

1800
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:15.450
after a lot of years I finally found my true voice and I'm comfortable in it,

1801
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.710
but now he's got to start filtering it back in and figuring out how to draw,

1802
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.560
come directly from me.
Like if I can,
you know,
engage.

1803
01:38:22.561 --> 01:38:24.810
Like the reason I got out of politics,
it was essentially like,

1804
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:28.590
I don't know if I was angry about politics as much as I was just angry.

1805
01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.330
And that's when I started the podcast.
I'm like,

1806
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:32.340
I'm just going to deal with my anger and what's under that.

1807
01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:37.200
I had a conversation with Jamie kills team one,
smelled podcasts,
uh,
about,
uh,
uh,

1808
01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:42.190
<v 0>six rather.
And,
uh,
we were,
were talking about whether or not like in,</v>

1809
01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.000
if you know that it's a rigged game.
Yeah.
And at this point,
essentially,

1810
01:38:46.090 --> 01:38:50.770
we all know it's a rigged game and you still talk about it as if it's real.
Like,

1811
01:38:50.771 --> 01:38:52.750
are you playing into the system?

1812
01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.210
And the problem with real politics is as you start talking about Filibusters and

1813
01:38:58.211 --> 01:39:00.190
Democrats in Congress and the Senate,

1814
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.410
you have that dealing with a nonsense game.

1815
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:06.220
<v 2>Well,
what you're dealing with is,
and that was directly,
uh,</v>

1816
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.430
my experience on political talk radio was that you're carrying water for

1817
01:39:09.431 --> 01:39:12.930
somebody.
Yes.
Because talking points or talking points and you know,
and,

1818
01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:17.280
and also the,
one of the problems as with political comedians is that,
you know,

1819
01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:21.430
if you're to the left,
there's about five talking points that will,
you know,

1820
01:39:21.431 --> 01:39:22.350
you're going to die

1821
01:39:22.450 --> 01:39:26.140
<v 0>super pro gay marriage.
You're going to get your take on that.
And that's it.</v>

1822
01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.660
And you,
by the way,
you're stuck with those points.
You can't,

1823
01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:33.880
you can't bury,
you can't have,
you know,
oh,
I,
but I like having guns.

1824
01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:36.120
You can't throw that in there.
And,
uh,

1825
01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.520
<v 2>no,
it's becomes tricky if you're going to be that guy.
Yeah.
So like,</v>

1826
01:39:40.521 --> 01:39:42.920
and I knew that.
I'm like well look,
you know,
I I there's a,

1827
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:47.300
I just fucking knew after I did politics side,
there's no way you can be,

1828
01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:51.470
if you're going to be completely partisan and that's going to be your angle,
um,

1829
01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:55.610
then you lose some of your ability to be a comic because you should be able to

1830
01:39:55.611 --> 01:40:00.500
call bullshit on anything.
Yeah,
no doubt.
And you kind of give that up.
Yes.

1831
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:03.140
Dennis Miller style.
Right,
right.

1832
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:06.870
<v 0>Which is very disturbing,
you know,
to me,
very disturbing.</v>

1833
01:40:06.871 --> 01:40:10.050
I heard Seinfeld talking about it.
It was really interesting what Seinfeld said.

1834
01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:13.680
His take on it was that that Denis didn't want to do the heavy lifting anymore

1835
01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:16.410
so he just found this sort of political thing and just went for that and just

1836
01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:20.280
cut out all the funny went with this like real easy path.

1837
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:22.320
I don't necessarily agree with that.

1838
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:26.400
I think he got scared and when he got scared he went super right wing.

1839
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.460
Cause it was all post nine 11.
It was all,

1840
01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:32.250
<v 2>oh,
you mean you mean Bush?
Yeah,
right.</v>

1841
01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.670
I happened to a lot of people that you thought were different than they were

1842
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.060
<v 0>the,
well,
there's a,
is it a comfort inn?</v>

1843
01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:43.710
Like going with that Rah Rah drink whiskey and shoot them and let God sort them

1844
01:40:44.131 --> 01:40:47.460
out.
There's a comfort to that whole,
you know,
idea.

1845
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:50.240
And there's also sort of a national

1846
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.100
<v 2>history of that kind of a jingoism I think you would call</v>

1847
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:59.100
<v 0>it aggressive people support that massive and antiwar myopic.</v>

1848
01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:03.070
Yes.
Narrow minded.
Yeah.
That's very clear.
You know what I mean?
Sure.

1849
01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.460
Don't want to entertain it.
The other stuff.
Yeah.
There's no,

1850
01:41:06.461 --> 01:41:09.100
there's no room for debate in there.
It's a very hard stance.

1851
01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:13.180
<v 2>I think the progressive thing is really,
it's,
it's,
it's about,
you know,
fairness,</v>

1852
01:41:13.181 --> 01:41:16.600
education,
the underdog,
you know,
people being represented properly.

1853
01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.490
<v 0>Aggressive mentality.
Yeah.
But I think like any ideology,</v>

1854
01:41:19.491 --> 01:41:21.570
you get these cookie cutter sort of Oh yeah.

1855
01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.630
The patterns that people just sort of fall into.

1856
01:41:23.631 --> 01:41:25.910
And that was what I was talking about.
Like this Trayvon Martin thing.

1857
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.030
It was like this woman screaming that she,
you know,
had a gun.

1858
01:41:29.031 --> 01:41:32.840
She would shoot George Zimmerman and all this craziness like there,

1859
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:34.700
there's a certain amount of that like,
okay,

1860
01:41:34.701 --> 01:41:38.690
this is not careful and considerate thinking about an issue that we're really

1861
01:41:38.691 --> 01:41:43.250
not,
we don't have second or even third hand experience in dealing with.

1862
01:41:43.251 --> 01:41:46.550
We're dealing with WWE.
I didn't,
I've never even heard that guy's voice.
Okay.

1863
01:41:46.551 --> 01:41:48.230
I've read some shit that he said.

1864
01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:51.130
I've heard pundits and different people discuss it.
I've seen them,

1865
01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:55.190
the bar and CNN,
all the facts,
but I don't know what the fuck happened that day.

1866
01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:56.750
I don't know if it could have been avoided.

1867
01:41:56.751 --> 01:41:59.660
I don't know what happened other than one guy's dead and apparently they were in

1868
01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:00.650
the fight before he died.

1869
01:42:00.810 --> 01:42:00.961
<v 2>Well,</v>

1870
01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:05.961
I think that the real issue is that it's hard to deny that it's that it's was

1871
01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:12.090
not.
It was,
it was racially motivated probably.
Maybe,
and it's also,

1872
01:42:12.091 --> 01:42:16.440
it really becomes about guns and who gets guns and,
and how,

1873
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:20.880
you know how that law is a little nuts there.
There's,
I in my mind,

1874
01:42:20.881 --> 01:42:25.881
if you're a reasonable person because in in that law where you can shoot in self

1875
01:42:26.551 --> 01:42:28.440
defense and you can carry in self defense.

1876
01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:32.210
I don't know how that's different than the wild west.
Like you know,

1877
01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.510
he drew on me first.

1878
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:37.920
I mean that's literally the conversation you can have with that law.

1879
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:43.020
<v 0>Oh it's real.
Yeah.
And it,
that is a crazy law,
crazy concealed carry.
You know,</v>

1880
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:47.260
the idea of concealed carry is that if you have a well armed society,

1881
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:49.930
people are going to be more polite and there's people that subscribe to that

1882
01:42:49.931 --> 01:42:54.931
belief and that can be true or we all know people that lose their temper and if

1883
01:42:55.001 --> 01:42:58.000
you lose your temper and you just happen to be carrying a glock,
you know,

1884
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:00.310
crazy shit can happen that you really regret

1885
01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:04.590
<v 2>that the,
the,
the reality of,
of,
you know,</v>

1886
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:09.960
race in this country is that that kid was a suspect before he was born.

1887
01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:16.340
<v 0>True.
Most,
most likely.
And again,
we don't know what the interaction was,</v>

1888
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:20.930
but I mean I am not,
I'm out in either camp.
I think there's not,
first of all,

1889
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.200
something happened where that kid was beating the shit out of that guy.

1890
01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.120
And if you ever watch world star hip hop.com no ever watched the dudes get

1891
01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:32.240
knocked out and just a bunch of people run by and kick him in the head.

1892
01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.530
I mean there's,

1893
01:43:33.531 --> 01:43:38.300
there are some of the craziest fucking videos online of people getting hit and

1894
01:43:38.301 --> 01:43:40.690
then a bunch of people just kicking them while they're down.
There's,

1895
01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:44.240
there's this dark people out.
There are some people that do evil,

1896
01:43:44.241 --> 01:43:48.680
evil shit all over the world.
And when a guy is on top of you beating your ass,

1897
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:51.980
you know,
however it got to that,
I think Zimmerman hit

1898
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.190
<v 3>him first.
And if this guy is on top of you kicking your ass,</v>

1899
01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.760
I don't know what you're supposed to do.
And if you have a gun,
I mean,

1900
01:43:58.761 --> 01:44:02.090
what are you supposed to do?
Well,
either you kick,
what would I do if I,

1901
01:44:02.091 --> 01:44:05.690
if I didn't have the gun beat you to death?
No,
I run.
If you had the gun on you,

1902
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:09.120
but he wasn't going to,
he's not going out there.
He's not out front.

1903
01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:11.700
And that kid wasn't going to beat him to death.
Oh,
how do you know that?

1904
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:15.770
I got a good feeling.
Oh Jesus.
That's ridiculous.
You can't ever say that.
I've,

1905
01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:19.520
I've met people that beat,
beat someone to death accidentally.
I've met,

1906
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.260
I met more than one person.
Well,

1907
01:44:21.261 --> 01:44:23.240
I understand what you're saying that we don't really know what happened,

1908
01:44:23.241 --> 01:44:27.320
but we do know that a guy with a gun who was a basically a glorified rent,

1909
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:31.400
a cop who probably shouldn't been able to really have that gun.
I mean,

1910
01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:33.500
the cops were needed.
There should have been cops here.

1911
01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:34.520
Whatever the hell happened.

1912
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:39.820
Some guy who wasn't a cop shot a black kid and said that it was self defense.

1913
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:45.890
That's all.
So it's basically what we need said.
An unarmed black kid.
Yes.
So it's,

1914
01:44:45.891 --> 01:44:50.340
he said versus the dead guy who's got no voice,
no doubt.
And,
and,
and,

1915
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.560
and sadly in most parts of the country,
a lot of people are going to be like,

1916
01:44:54.561 --> 01:44:58.940
well know black kid was probably,
I mean,
come on,
he's a black kid maybe.

1917
01:44:58.941 --> 01:45:03.200
But there's also the reality,
and again that I'm not picking a side here,

1918
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.610
but then we might really been defending.

1919
01:45:04.611 --> 01:45:07.670
Kid was on top of him and he was beating his ass.
I mean,
that's the reality.

1920
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:10.940
Is it?
Shit?
Yes.
Why?
Why didn't we know that hit a broken nose?

1921
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:13.730
He had cuts in the back of his head from his head being banged off the ground.

1922
01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.980
I mean,
you've ever seen the photos of him?
Yeah,
he looked pretty bad.

1923
01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.520
He got beat up and he was probably,
look,
if,
if you ever had a guy beat you up,

1924
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:22.910
if you ever had someone kick your ass,
no.
This is a very scary thing.

1925
01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:26.690
I don't need it.
This is a very scary thing when you're in a fight,

1926
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:29.440
and especially if it's a fist fight,
like out on the street,
not,

1927
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.900
not a martial arts competition,
but a fist fight.
It's a very scary thing.

1928
01:45:32.901 --> 01:45:35.690
When you worried you're going to go out,
you're going to go out,

1929
01:45:35.691 --> 01:45:39.200
and this guy who was trying to kill you,
smashing you off the ground,

1930
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:41.340
has the ability to do whatever he wants to do.

1931
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.880
You mean you're going to go unconscious,
you're going to be unconscious.
I get it.

1932
01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:47.150
And that's the reality of physically when you,
if you've never been hit before,

1933
01:45:47.151 --> 01:45:48.320
it's a terrifying thing.

1934
01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:52.520
When somebody hits you and you see sparks in front of your eyes and you feel

1935
01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:56.270
yourself drifting in and out of consciousness and you trying to stay conscious,

1936
01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.190
you keep hitting you.
Yeah,
it's terrifying.

1937
01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:01.940
And if you had a gun and it was between him or you,
you might pull the gun.

1938
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:05.720
The real question is how did it get to that situation in the first place?

1939
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.050
Did he harassed that kid?
Did he fuck up?
Was that kid that,

1940
01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.690
was that the straw that broke the camel's back?
There's a lot of issues.

1941
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:15.740
Who started what,
but it's not clear situation.
No,
I get it.

1942
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:18.490
But what's clear is a,
is a,
you know,
a black teenager,

1943
01:46:18.491 --> 01:46:21.470
his dad who was unarmed and that guy wasn't a cop who had a gun,

1944
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:25.940
shot him and he says he would if the kid beat him to death.
No,
I get all that.

1945
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.060
But I mean,
you know what,
I'm not,
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying it is,

1946
01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.200
there are things out there that will beat you to death.
Sure.
You know,
I know.

1947
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.780
But also on the other side of that,
what if he beat him to death?

1948
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:40.040
There's also the question of what did happen,
who started what.
It's true.

1949
01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.560
Absolutely.
So like,
you know,
a huge part of it.
Yeah.
And,
and,

1950
01:46:42.561 --> 01:46:46.250
and that is the gray area.
But I think the question is,
is,
you know,

1951
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:50.310
is there a racial component?
Yes.
And is that kind of crazy?
Yeah.

1952
01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:55.160
<v 0>Yes.
And,
um,
well,
there's a lot of issues.
Obviously.
The,
the,</v>

1953
01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.790
the real issue that I have brought up ad nauseum on this podcast is,

1954
01:46:59.090 --> 01:47:02.660
it's the weirdest fucking aspect of our culture is that we don't address that

1955
01:47:02.661 --> 01:47:05.180
weakest point in the chain,
which is impoverished.

1956
01:47:05.181 --> 01:47:07.370
People in terrible neighborhoods that are,
are,

1957
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.930
are facing pressure that other people don't have to face.
And why,
why,

1958
01:47:11.931 --> 01:47:12.950
why don't they do that?

1959
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:16.880
If Halliburton could make billions of dollars rebuilding Iraq,

1960
01:47:16.881 --> 01:47:20.030
why the fuck can't they make billions of dollars rebuilding ghettos?
Like,

1961
01:47:20.031 --> 01:47:24.350
I don't understand why that's not somehow or another profitable to,

1962
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:28.010
to like to have a society that has less people that are fucked up,

1963
01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.860
less people in trouble,
less people that are losers.
That's a better,

1964
01:47:31.150 --> 01:47:31.391
<v 3>well yeah,</v>

1965
01:47:31.391 --> 01:47:36.270
but then like what I think that what a right wing thinker would say to you by

1966
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:39.880
bootstraps or know that you're talking about socialism,

1967
01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.470
that you know in a sense that,
you know,

1968
01:47:41.471 --> 01:47:44.330
in order for private industry to be involved in that what,

1969
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:47.260
what private industry wants to do and they want to privatize everything in the

1970
01:47:47.261 --> 01:47:49.660
right wingers is that,
sure they would love to do that,

1971
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:52.270
but they don't want to do it for the poor people.

1972
01:47:52.271 --> 01:47:54.850
What they'd like to do is we'd love to rebuild this neighborhood.

1973
01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:58.930
How do we kill all these poor people and gentrify this actually,

1974
01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.140
how do we arrest them then how Burton will come down and say like,
look,
you know,

1975
01:48:02.141 --> 01:48:05.850
we got rid of them all night and now you could actually have kids here and,
and,

1976
01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.990
and could put them where you even made the school better.

1977
01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.630
But does it have to be either or?
I mean it's,

1978
01:48:09.631 --> 01:48:13.150
it seems like it doesn't have to be that way just because that's really not

1979
01:48:13.151 --> 01:48:17.410
necessarily socialism.
What did it,
what it is is like if the government is,

1980
01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:20.800
but yeah,
but because full socialism in my mind it's like,

1981
01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.760
it's a broad spectrum of what,
I mean,
it's socialism in a sense.

1982
01:48:24.761 --> 01:48:28.900
It's like cultural socialism,
like a community socialism.

1983
01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:30.430
Like the idea of,
you know,

1984
01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:35.670
everybody should pay a price to keep the world healthy and if you make more

1985
01:48:35.921 --> 01:48:38.380
money,
you should pay some money back to,

1986
01:48:38.381 --> 01:48:41.320
to create a healthy environment around you and to help give it back to the

1987
01:48:41.321 --> 01:48:44.740
system.
I agreed.
If that's sort of socialism,
I don't,
I don't necessarily,

1988
01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:49.420
whatever,
I don't want to label what it is,
but more your idea of community,
right?

1989
01:48:49.421 --> 01:48:52.510
Your question is,
is that with so much money in the world and with the,
you know,

1990
01:48:52.511 --> 01:48:57.460
living in,
in a,
in a great country which we live in as a,
an abundance of wealth,

1991
01:48:57.670 --> 01:49:00.820
why are there still people living in third world poverty and why are there

1992
01:49:00.821 --> 01:49:04.570
people that,
uh,
you know,
have to,
you know,
grow up with,

1993
01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.760
with no hope and no real future,
uh,
in the,

1994
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:10.900
in the s and it's stacked against him and instead of the words,
Whoa,

1995
01:49:10.930 --> 01:49:14.470
why is it that it's,
why is nothing being done?

1996
01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.750
It's not the why of these things.
Why do they exist?

1997
01:49:16.751 --> 01:49:19.710
There's always going to be a broad spectrum of,
of,
of,
uh,

1998
01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.590
of the condition of people from the worst case scenario to the best case

1999
01:49:23.591 --> 01:49:27.130
scenario.
There's always going to be that.
But why is there not any focus on that?

2000
01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.940
I mean,
it's always reason the jobs,

2001
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:32.980
the folks in the class and focus on in the political dialogue,
right?
But like,

2002
01:49:32.981 --> 01:49:34.840
I mean I think those are the real heroes of,

2003
01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:38.650
of whatever you call progressive are the people that are working on a community

2004
01:49:38.651 --> 01:49:42.400
level,
on an account level,
on a city level too,

2005
01:49:42.401 --> 01:49:47.380
to help people that are in trouble and to help people that can't afford and to

2006
01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:48.310
help make

2007
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:49.870
<v 1>life easier for those who,</v>

2008
01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:53.680
the idea that somehow or another it's equal opportunity for everybody in this

2009
01:49:53.681 --> 01:49:55.360
country after a certain point becomes a little bit

2010
01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.300
<v 0>Nicholas.
It's totally ridiculous.
It's,
there's,</v>

2011
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:59.480
there's no starting point that's equal.

2012
01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.120
The only thing that is equal is we're here together.
That's it.

2013
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:06.620
And some people get super lucky and some people have a shit roll the dice and

2014
01:50:06.650 --> 01:50:08.150
there's no getting around that.

2015
01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:12.200
And there's some sort of humility and understanding that you got lucky and

2016
01:50:12.201 --> 01:50:14.330
there's an obligation if you did get lucky,

2017
01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:18.410
this sort of give a little bit back or to to help a little or to,
you know,
to,

2018
01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:20.570
to mentor or to offer guidance.

2019
01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.810
<v 1>I think that's great.
That's,
I mean that's,
those are,
you know,</v>

2020
01:50:22.811 --> 01:50:25.390
progressive ideas and a good start.
And like,
I used to do a joke,

2021
01:50:25.391 --> 01:50:29.410
I never really worked about how,
I never thought there would be,
you know,

2022
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.690
universal healthcare in this country because you know,

2023
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:36.460
the system needs to turnover that like,
you know,
they need poor people to die,

2024
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:39.740
you know,
because they can't,
you know,
you don't,
you know,
the,

2025
01:50:39.741 --> 01:50:41.410
they believe the system can't afford it.

2026
01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:44.590
I mean that's where you get all that weird welfare state thinking.
That's where,

2027
01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.340
you know,
the right wings as you know,
are,
are,
are completely against,
you know,

2028
01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:51.920
food stamps or any sort of program that that feels like a,

2029
01:50:51.921 --> 01:50:56.921
a shell out to people that aren't doing their part or lazy or that kind of Shit.

2030
01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.830
It's,
it's a bad frame.
And you know,

2031
01:50:59.831 --> 01:51:03.910
some of the greatest things about this country has been helping people that can

2032
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:04.070
help

2033
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:07.540
<v 0>themselves.
Yeah.
And a lot of those people were fucking children.</v>

2034
01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:10.790
And if you think that children need to be pulled and put them show up by moves,

2035
01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:13.930
cramp,
that's,
it's a ridiculous point of view.
It just,

2036
01:51:13.931 --> 01:51:17.170
it's a ridiculous point of view.
And it's not a,
it's not a,
it's not honest.

2037
01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.190
So healthy for you,

2038
01:51:18.191 --> 01:51:21.460
either it's not healthy for anybody to pretend that these people were in these

2039
01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:25.210
fucked up neighborhoods.
Well,
they didn't just get a terrible roll the dice.

2040
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:27.790
<v 1>That's right.
And it's like,
yeah,
I think that,
you know,</v>

2041
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.850
understanding are really feeling the joy of being selfless in any way is tricky

2042
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:34.684
for angry people.

2043
01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.810
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,</v>

2044
01:51:35.811 --> 01:51:40.460
one of the things that I'm really happy about this Trayvon Martin case is that

2045
01:51:40.461 --> 01:51:42.770
no one's writing.
It's really interesting.

2046
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.540
There's peaceful protests and I think that is not just commendable.

2047
01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:50.840
I think it's a huge moment in our culture where people are,

2048
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:54.980
it's almost like they're starting to learn like,
Hey,
don't fuck this up.
Hey,

2049
01:51:55.130 --> 01:51:58.250
let's not hurt any innocent people.
Hey,
let's,
no,
I know you're pissed off.

2050
01:51:58.251 --> 01:51:59.270
Just not lightening buildings on

2051
01:51:59.310 --> 01:52:03.330
<v 1>or in a cynical way.
Uh,
you know,
I think you're right.</v>

2052
01:52:03.331 --> 01:52:04.800
But I also think sadly,

2053
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:09.180
that the black community knew that this is the way it was going to play out.

2054
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.260
<v 0>Well,
there's a lot of people that feel like as the law was written,</v>

2055
01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:17.020
what he did was justifiable.
Now,

2056
01:52:17.021 --> 01:52:21.640
is that a black white thing or is that a law thing and what it,
what,
what,
where,

2057
01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.540
where does this get drawn?
Like how does this,
is it

2058
01:52:25.650 --> 01:52:27.440
<v 1>Hispanic?
Yeah,
I guess not</v>

2059
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.890
<v 0>white know.
I mean he was white,
but I mean,
you know what I'm saying?
No,
no,
I do.</v>

2060
01:52:30.891 --> 01:52:35.750
I do.
It's a very tricky situation.
Yeah.
It comes down to guns.
Some of it,

2061
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:38.810
some of it comes down to behavior.
Some of it comes down to community.

2062
01:52:38.811 --> 01:52:42.590
Some of it comes to us,
the way people were raised about guns.
You know,
the law,

2063
01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:46.310
that law,
first of all,
one of the reasons why that logs

2064
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:51.310
<v 3>this is because Florida is the fucking craziest place on the planet to Africa.</v>

2065
01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:52.850
No,
I don't think you should.

2066
01:52:52.851 --> 01:52:56.850
But if you're a as terrified white person and you're a over 60 and you just like

2067
01:52:56.851 --> 01:52:57.411
to play golf,

2068
01:52:57.411 --> 01:53:00.880
you don't want to get carjacked and you start like hearing about all these

2069
01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.530
terrible,
you'll vote on these laws.
But that's a good point.

2070
01:53:03.531 --> 01:53:08.440
You just said terrified white person.
Yeah,
sure.
Terrified white people blue.

2071
01:53:08.441 --> 01:53:11.750
I'm not,
I'm not standing up.
No,
no,
no.
But there's a lot of it.
Is that right?

2072
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.870
What's one of the things we're finding out on this TV show that I'm doing?

2073
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:16.490
I'm a white people are a problem.

2074
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:20.750
It's all white people looking for big foot's white people that are seeing the

2075
01:53:20.751 --> 01:53:24.620
Ufos,
white people that are investigating psychics.
It's all fucking white people.

2076
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:27.260
I've met,
not one black person looking for big foot.

2077
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.730
I had been squashing from months.

2078
01:53:28.731 --> 01:53:32.010
Now I haven't met a goddamn single black person looking for big foot.

2079
01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:32.870
Maybe you should,

2080
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:37.100
maybe you should reach out and perhaps next time just go bring up this one.
Yeah,

2081
01:53:37.101 --> 01:53:41.830
I'll,
I'll bring,
I'll bring someone with me.
Yeah.
It's the,
uh,

2082
01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.840
the idea that we all start from an equal starting point ready go and the pistol

2083
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:50.390
goes off.
It's crazy and it's,
it doesn't,
it doesn't hold up anymore.

2084
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:52.760
It used to be when you were,
you know,

2085
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:55.610
like we were talking about people that they were savages and the sixties and

2086
01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:57.620
seventies,
they didn't have the kind of information that we have today.

2087
01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:02.000
They didn't know.
They didn't have that,
that was a real fight.
I mean like,

2088
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:05.930
you know,
the weird thing about that time it,
you know,

2089
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:09.470
sort of civil rights wise and also the sort of radical,

2090
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.800
the hippie movement and all that stuff is that that was a huge,

2091
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:17.270
tremendous cultural shift shore.
So like in all that stuff was just blowing up.

2092
01:54:17.271 --> 01:54:19.160
So I mean,
yeah,
there were a lot of savages,

2093
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:22.000
but there was also a lot of people fighting to,

2094
01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:26.780
to sort of open minds to get some,
you know,
to get some justice and know it was,

2095
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:31.300
it's kind of a mixed bag.
You know,
my,
one of my favorite cities in the country,

2096
01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:33.710
San Francisco,
and uh,
it's,
it's,

2097
01:54:33.711 --> 01:54:37.760
I have a long relationship with the city.
I lived there when I was a little kid.

2098
01:54:37.761 --> 01:54:41.090
It was like responsible and a lot of ways for sort of how I viewed the world

2099
01:54:41.091 --> 01:54:45.740
when I was really young.
Um,
but it also has like,
almost like,

2100
01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.150
you know,
when a bell,
when someone rings a bell and it's got this echo to it.

2101
01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:53.390
Yeah.
And then you can't quite tell when the echo's gone away.

2102
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:58.780
San Francisco still has that from like the hippie movement of the 60s just think

2103
01:55:00.570 --> 01:55:04.310
dust in the air that the evolution.

2104
01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.920
Like I lived there for a couple of years and I used to do a joke about that.

2105
01:55:06.921 --> 01:55:08.670
It's like,
you know,
you can go down on the,
uh,

2106
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.870
towards the upper Haight and there's those guys you see on the street that took

2107
01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:14.630
Jim Morrison device in the 60s and broke on through to the other side,

2108
01:55:14.631 --> 01:55:18.950
but never made note of the door back.
And they'd be like,

2109
01:55:18.951 --> 01:55:19.790
you got a dollar.

2110
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.060
And they just give you that fucking 10,000 yard stare from too much

2111
01:55:23.061 --> 01:55:25.850
hallucinogenics and you're like,
sure,
I'll give you a dollar if you give back,

2112
01:55:25.851 --> 01:55:28.880
whatever you just took out of my soul with your fucking eyeballs.

2113
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.620
I want to move to San Francisco.

2114
01:55:30.621 --> 01:55:33.140
And I fucked up and brought my wife to Haight Ashbury.

2115
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:36.620
And then we went and walked with our little cats into the park afterwards.

2116
01:55:36.621 --> 01:55:40.460
It was,
fuck,
it was so many cracked out homeless people on skateboards.

2117
01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:43.650
And this is so much chaos.
But I think the spirit of that city,
you know,

2118
01:55:43.651 --> 01:55:46.170
not just the 60s but with,
um,
with the,

2119
01:55:46.171 --> 01:55:49.710
the gay rights movement in the evolution that it's always been sort of a haven

2120
01:55:49.711 --> 01:55:51.090
for real open minded shit.

2121
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:53.490
Like even when I moved there for two years to do comedy,

2122
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.240
they were very supportive,
uh,
comedy audience and they liked comedy.

2123
01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:01.290
That kind of took chances and it's always been,
you know,
for,
you know,

2124
01:56:01.291 --> 01:56:04.560
mental adventurers,
it's always been my favorite place to perform.

2125
01:56:04.670 --> 01:56:07.890
[inaudible] I feel like the place that holds you up to the highest standards,

2126
01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:11.100
higher standards of thinking and it makes you like,
what are you,

2127
01:56:11.101 --> 01:56:13.630
where are you going with this?
Right.
It's a,

2128
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:16.950
it's a smarter place that seemed more aware and it's trippy to dude.

2129
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.270
I mean I lived there for two years.

2130
01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:21.390
I didn't know what the fuck was going on ever from neighborhood to neighborhood.

2131
01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:24.480
I'm like,
who's in charge here?
What the fuck is happening?

2132
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:27.270
You could go one block and you're like,
wow,
this feels pretty peaceful,

2133
01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:30.000
but there's a little bit of menace and then two blocks weight or you're like,
oh,

2134
01:56:30.001 --> 01:56:32.640
I just entered a fucking chaos vortex here.

2135
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:36.660
I lived there when I was between h seven and 11.
And when I was seven,

2136
01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:41.790
my step dad's sister came to live with us and she would go next door to these

2137
01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:45.270
gay folks and they would all take their clothes off and play bongos.

2138
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:47.850
I smoke weed.
I remember I was seven.
I was like,

2139
01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:50.960
what kind of a fucking reality do I live in?
Went from Newark,

2140
01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:55.620
New Jersey to my aunt getting naked,
playing bongos.

2141
01:56:55.621 --> 01:56:58.560
This gay black dude.
And his boyfriend was hilarious.

2142
01:56:58.561 --> 01:57:02.580
That's why people went to San Francisco.
It was an amazing place.
I didn't,

2143
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:05.350
and I tell the story in the podcast,
I didn't know what a nigger,
man,

2144
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:07.470
I didn't know what it meant until I moved to Florida.

2145
01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:11.300
We went from San Francisco to Florida.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
my dad was,
uh,

2146
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.460
going to the University of Florida,
Gainesville.
And,
uh,
I,

2147
01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:19.200
my friend was talking about the niggers and I came to,
I came home to my mother.

2148
01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:21.480
I was like,
what does that mean?
She goes,
you know what it means?
I go,

2149
01:57:21.481 --> 01:57:24.420
I don't know what it means.
And then she goes,
it's a,

2150
01:57:24.421 --> 01:57:28.500
it's a bad word for black people.
And I was like,
what?
I couldn't,
I was like,

2151
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:33.740
I was so blown away.
I was like,
how stupid is my fucking friend?
Like he's,

2152
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:34.880
he's saying that,

2153
01:57:35.070 --> 01:57:39.240
but it was like that mentality I didn't experience in San Francisco and San

2154
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:44.180
Francisco in the 70s,
from 19,
from a guest,
67,
600 students.
How many?
Um,

2155
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:49.190
74 to 77 is when I lived at San Francisco and that,

2156
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:52.980
it was,
it was,
it was such an open minded place.
It was amazing.
Yeah,
no,

2157
01:57:52.981 --> 01:57:56.850
it's beautiful.
I mean,
the first time you,
you hear that word used as an adult,

2158
01:57:56.851 --> 01:58:00.420
even casually,
when somebody casually uses that word,
it's almost like this weird,

2159
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.640
you know,
kind of like test.
They,
you know,
they,

2160
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.970
they kind of test you with it and you,
you,
you got to sit there and be like,

2161
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:09.690
I'm not gonna,
I can't do this.
Whatever it is.

2162
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:13.830
Did you hear that story about the Goldman Sachs guy that's in critical condition

2163
01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.380
went up some black couples,
you know,

2164
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:19.200
saying something about niggers and this guy knocked them out.
We'll know that.

2165
01:58:19.201 --> 01:58:22.320
I thought this story was,
he was sort of in trouble and wobbly.

2166
01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:23.940
The guy helped him,

2167
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.570
the guy who stood up to help him and then he fucking lit out on the guy said

2168
01:58:27.571 --> 01:58:29.950
this Nigga one nigger,
right?
Watson fighting.
Yeah.

2169
01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:32.820
And then that's that moment dude.
Yup.
Yup.

2170
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:36.270
That's that moment that black people have to live with that we don't have to

2171
01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:39.780
live with.
Yeah.
And especially if for some fucking trunk,

2172
01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:44.080
Wall Street Dickhead,
I feel like I should tell you that a piss on the bed story,

2173
01:58:44.230 --> 01:58:47.040
I feel like,
yeah,
I have it in my head.
No,
no,
no.

2174
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:50.800
There's nothing to apologize about,
but I got to pee and I don't want to,

2175
01:58:50.801 --> 01:58:53.900
you know,
I don't.
You Go pee and I'll,
I'll talk to this little fella.
Oh,

2176
01:58:53.901 --> 01:58:56.470
I can do that.
Yeah,
you can do that.
It was three of us.
All right.
All right.

2177
01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.770
Where's the bathroom?
Well,
right through that door and to the right hand side.

2178
01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:04.430
All right.
We're going to talk some shit about you as soon as you leave.

2179
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:08.870
So I was in Toronto.
Gi played the underground cafe and everyone says hi.

2180
01:59:08.871 --> 01:59:10.310
Everyone loves you there.

2181
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:14.200
That place is so cool and it's so amazing that even exist there.
Yeah.

2182
01:59:14.210 --> 01:59:16.520
Don't say too much because I don't think we'll be doing,
those are

2183
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:23.030
the nicest folks.
It's a,
I did that place with the iron sheet,

2184
01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:26.300
came on stage with me the last time I was there.
Every last was in town,

2185
01:59:26.301 --> 01:59:29.690
so everybody came to one of my shows.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2186
01:59:29.691 --> 01:59:33.020
Toronto is a bad ass town,
man.
It really is an amazing place.

2187
01:59:33.170 --> 01:59:37.580
Canada in general is like one of my favorite places to perform,
but I don't know.

2188
01:59:37.581 --> 01:59:40.730
It's hard to pick up a best cause I had a great time in Winnipeg.

2189
01:59:40.731 --> 01:59:44.330
I was there too.
But Vancouver and Toronto,
it's all day.

2190
01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.260
It's weird seeing how Toronto like seems like it has so much money like that

2191
01:59:48.261 --> 01:59:49.760
city everywhere you go there.

2192
01:59:49.761 --> 01:59:54.761
So I think it's 70% of all cranes in the world are in Toronto and these are

2193
01:59:54.771 --> 01:59:57.380
cranes that you can't just move from one country to country.

2194
01:59:57.381 --> 01:59:58.240
Is that a real statistic?

2195
01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:02.150
Somebody told me there so they live there and I don't trust him.

2196
02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.930
I Google that shit.
How the fuck are 70% of all the cranes in Toronto?

2197
02:00:05.931 --> 02:00:10.000
That shit's,
I don't,
not possible.
I mean maybe it's not,

2198
02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:13.190
but bunch of Google it real quick.
Should we should answer these questions.

2199
02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:15.770
It's not like we live in the dark ages and we don't have the Google,

2200
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:18.500
but it's just amazing how much money they have.
Like,

2201
02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:21.710
like people cause each one of these Skype,
there was everywhere you look,

2202
02:00:21.711 --> 02:00:24.320
skyscrapers were being built in each one of these skyscrapers probably are

2203
02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:27.060
thousands and thousands of people and just like where are the condom?

2204
02:00:27.210 --> 02:00:31.100
He didn't take a shit like ours did.
Theirs was affected somewhat by ours.

2205
02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:32.150
We're talking about Canada,

2206
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:35.990
but they didn't have the mortgage crisis that we had in America.
It's just,

2207
02:00:35.991 --> 02:00:38.520
it's not the same sort of a scenario.

2208
02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:43.670
There are economies that actually based on worth and value,
maybe sort of,

2209
02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:47.210
what am I talking about?
I'm talking like I understand the economy.

2210
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:49.760
How funny is that?
It's tricky,
but it business,

2211
02:00:49.761 --> 02:00:53.800
I fucking how many cranes they have up there,
Brian,
let's see.
It says here,

2212
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:57.050
currently there are about 300 tower cranes working in Canadians.

2213
02:00:57.051 --> 02:01:00.500
Largest city Canadia can get an idea.

2214
02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:04.760
Sounds like a real website.
Paul said that before that,

2215
02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:06.850
<v 4>okay.</v>

2216
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:11.560
<v 3>What does it say?
45% is what?
This is 45% of the worlds' cranes,</v>

2217
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.830
it seems like,
I don't know.
It's a weird,
Jamie was,
it said,
I don't trust Brian.

2218
02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:18.730
He can't read.
No,
it just doesn't really make too much sense.

2219
02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:21.160
It looks like it's saying 45%

2220
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:25.760
<v 4>yeah.
In residential construction.
It's fucked up.</v>

2221
02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:30.660
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
whatever.
Canada's awesome.
Do you,
uh,
do you work up there?
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2222
02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:34.090
I like going to Canada.
I love Vancouver.
I've been to,
I've been to Vancouver,

2223
02:01:34.091 --> 02:01:36.550
Montreal,
Toronto,
Winnipeg,
Calgary.

2224
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:41.330
I thought about moving to Vancouver in 2004 it's very briefly when Bush won the

2225
02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:44.510
reelection.
I was like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
I was like,

2226
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:47.300
this is so great.
I had a whole bit about it,
you know,

2227
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:52.600
that whole bit about let's you like my whole bit about George Bush was that

2228
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.590
after they put him into office that a bunch of people were sitting around going,

2229
02:01:57.650 --> 02:02:01.050
I think we can go dumber.
You know,
like I look how dumb they are.

2230
02:02:01.051 --> 02:02:04.130
Like they love him.
Like I think we can go dumber and that,
you know,

2231
02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.920
it was like the whole thing about him winning again.
Like what is he saying?

2232
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:08.810
Did you teach him the worth?
Teaching them the fucking words.

2233
02:02:08.811 --> 02:02:12.170
Have you ever seen a more confident,
more on this is like you won again.

2234
02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:16.850
He won again.
Really?
And why are we going to war with them?
Yeah.
And how'd they,

2235
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.700
how'd they figure?
How'd they write that down?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

2236
02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:24.080
And they bought that Holy Shit.
Sure.
He just tapped into that anger dude.
Well,

2237
02:02:24.081 --> 02:02:25.220
there's,
he's,
um,

2238
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:29.660
he actually is a saying so really rational things when it comes to immigration.

2239
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:33.950
We're a nation.
It's fascinating.
It's like they've given him some,

2240
02:02:33.951 --> 02:02:37.100
a left leaning talking points,
you know,
as an older gentleman,

2241
02:02:37.130 --> 02:02:41.390
you know how Mr. Bush,
I would just,
we'd,
we'd appreciate it if you,
you know,

2242
02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:45.950
softening those guys are,
the thing is,
is that the,
you know,

2243
02:02:45.951 --> 02:02:49.370
in the 60s there's something called,
I don't know you,
maybe you can look it up.

2244
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:53.540
I think it's called the Powell doctrine.
I don't check it out.

2245
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:57.680
There was something written in the 60s after the big revolution in the hippies

2246
02:02:57.681 --> 02:03:01.190
and everything else that the chamber of Commerce got together and they said,

2247
02:03:01.191 --> 02:03:04.110
look,
what almost happened here in our minds is that,
you know,

2248
02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.620
we came very close to,
to socialism,

2249
02:03:06.621 --> 02:03:10.970
taking over and at that time of group of business thinkers said,

2250
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.630
capitalism could never be threatened again.
No matter what,

2251
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.830
whatever we have to do to guarantee the safety of capitalism is what needs to be

2252
02:03:18.831 --> 02:03:22.070
done.
So all this other shit,
when it comes right down to it,
politics,

2253
02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:26.630
anything else all these guys give a fuck about is capitalism.
You know,

2254
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:30.470
democracy is secondary.
It's sort of a money laundering operation,
right?

2255
02:03:30.471 --> 02:03:35.240
So all they want to do pretty leery tune in,
drop out shit.
People are like,
no,
no,

2256
02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:39.200
no.
They felt that,
you know,
with the SDS,
uh,
you know,
in some of the other,

2257
02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:43.020
they really thought that there was going to be that,
that,
that the,

2258
02:03:43.021 --> 02:03:46.640
the structure of capitalism was threatened.
And when it comes right down to it,

2259
02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:48.770
it's all,
it's about,
you know,
most of the,

2260
02:03:48.771 --> 02:03:52.260
the right wing guys and most of the moped that most politicians are owned and,

2261
02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:55.640
and all they give a fuck about is that the money keeps flowing.

2262
02:03:55.641 --> 02:03:58.040
They don't really care about people.
They just,
you know,

2263
02:03:58.041 --> 02:04:01.520
the trick of politics is to placate enough people into thinking that things are

2264
02:04:01.521 --> 02:04:05.870
okay and going their way so they can go on making money.

2265
02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:10.160
That's it.
Yeah.
Especially in this day and age.

2266
02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:14.630
And when you think about what had happened in between the 1950s in the 1960s

2267
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.600
what a devastating change in culture.
I mean,

2268
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:19.340
do people that were in positions of power,

2269
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:22.700
when all of a sudden you have this weird rock and roll movement and these

2270
02:04:22.701 --> 02:04:27.350
hippies and you've got Woodstock and you know these people on acid and they're,

2271
02:04:27.351 --> 02:04:31.130
they're,
they're behaving in ways and no one's ever behaved throughout history.

2272
02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:32.570
We've never had groups of people,

2273
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:36.110
flower power and the Ken Keasy in the Merry Pranksters,

2274
02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:39.060
everyone's holding and shit like what the fuck is going on?

2275
02:04:39.061 --> 02:04:42.660
The weather underground and you're having orgies and trying to blow up banks and

2276
02:04:42.661 --> 02:04:45.510
established order was nervous.
It was craziness.

2277
02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:48.390
It was such a radical shift.
And,

2278
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.650
and it was also psychedelic that the people who were established and the older

2279
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:57.120
folks and a lot of evil people that had got away with a lot of shit for a long

2280
02:04:57.121 --> 02:05:01.410
time,
they did not want any of it.
They didn't want,
none of this had to stop.

2281
02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:05.490
It's how to stop in order to get this country back on track.
Let's,
you know,

2282
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:06.990
full on reefer madness,

2283
02:05:06.991 --> 02:05:10.010
whatever the fuck we have to try to get people back in gear and everything.
It's

2284
02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.160
<v 1>sort of a,</v>

2285
02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:16.160
a sham that what becomes sad is that if there are enough people in this country

2286
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:20.790
that think they're okay,
that's enough to keep the momentum going.
Yeah.

2287
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:25.200
Because the people that are really fucked rarely have a voice and the people

2288
02:05:25.201 --> 02:05:28.620
that are way better than okay,
they're just moving the parts around.

2289
02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:32.570
So like this whole,
the status quo is what drives this whole thing is this.

2290
02:05:32.571 --> 02:05:35.700
If enough people,
like if you can't get people angry enough to vote,

2291
02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:38.610
like you know,
if you look at the voting numbers,
how many people really vote?

2292
02:05:38.850 --> 02:05:40.640
I can hardly anybody cause they,

2293
02:05:40.660 --> 02:05:42.630
they're just hopeless or they're like Nah to hell.

2294
02:05:42.631 --> 02:05:44.670
Differences are going to make they fucking,

2295
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:47.940
they like when people were pissed off,
they like to divide and conquer.

2296
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:51.240
They like when there's a lot of fucking ridiculous fights going on about

2297
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:53.760
bullshit so that way they can just keep pillaging.

2298
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:56.320
<v 3>What did you think about hacking democracy?
I'm sure you saw that.</v>

2299
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.960
I didn't see it.
The Hbo Documentary,
which one was that?

2300
02:05:59.010 --> 02:06:02.700
There was the one where they show the Diebold,
but before Diebold changed,
well,

2301
02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:04.060
I was part of that.

2302
02:06:04.090 --> 02:06:07.270
I was at Air America when all that shit was happening with the machines.
Yeah,

2303
02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:10.960
craziness.
The craziness is just like,
if I can tell people what it is.

2304
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:15.790
So the debug machines were owned by a company that was a right wing supporter

2305
02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:20.330
and was I think owned by a big donator to $1 million.
No,

2306
02:06:20.350 --> 02:06:23.980
you should dollars at camp.
The idea was the deep old machines were rigged,

2307
02:06:24.250 --> 02:06:25.900
that they were rigged and that,
you know,

2308
02:06:25.901 --> 02:06:28.930
and then it became the standard that Bush,
I think put it through that it was,

2309
02:06:28.931 --> 02:06:32.560
it was the standard machine that was going to be used for most of the voting

2310
02:06:32.561 --> 02:06:36.070
systems,
certainly in Ohio and certainly in the places that were questionable.

2311
02:06:36.190 --> 02:06:39.280
And to clarify for folks who haven't seen it,
first of all see it.
If you can,

2312
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:40.390
if you're an interesting cause,

2313
02:06:40.391 --> 02:06:44.800
it's amazing how transparent the corruption is and it's amazing how little this

2314
02:06:44.801 --> 02:06:45.760
does gets discussed.

2315
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:49.630
They designed a machine for voting that allows a third party input and they

2316
02:06:49.631 --> 02:06:52.560
proved it on the HBO show that you could rig an election.
Sure.

2317
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:55.500
They had their own little election and they,
they rigged it and then got,

2318
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:58.150
they've always recollections one way or the other course because the way it's

2319
02:06:58.151 --> 02:07:00.940
broken down and gerrymandering and these districts and like,

2320
02:07:00.941 --> 02:07:04.180
it's all the Florida black people where the craziness that went down there.

2321
02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:07.210
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Sorry.
You cannot vote.
Oh,
there's no machine.
Oh yeah.

2322
02:07:07.211 --> 02:07:10.820
We got some wood says the urine.
A criminal.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2323
02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:14.290
Put a bunch of people's names,
credible criminal damage databases.

2324
02:07:14.291 --> 02:07:16.630
And they would have to prove they're not a criminal in order to be able to vote.

2325
02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:19.720
I think in the history of voting,
both parties have stolen elections.

2326
02:07:19.721 --> 02:07:22.990
I would have to imagine.
I bet.
I bet they would justify it.

2327
02:07:22.991 --> 02:07:27.660
The left could justify it,
you know,
I don't know if they could.
I think that like,

2328
02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:32.290
you know,
politicians at their best,
uh,
in terms of how they're,
uh,

2329
02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:35.050
sort of taken in by the war.
There were bullshit.

2330
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.280
<v 2>The ones that really have big hearts,
White Bernie Sanders and you know,
the,</v>

2331
02:07:39.281 --> 02:07:40.560
you know,
uh,
what was it?

2332
02:07:40.561 --> 02:07:44.320
The fine gold [inaudible] he's gone now that there's some people that then

2333
02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:48.260
honest,
we want to help people.
But most of the govern,
well,
yeah.
I,

2334
02:07:48.261 --> 02:07:50.770
I wish I had more education about,
you know,
what,

2335
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:54.820
you know what it was like then because I am not a huge student of things,

2336
02:07:54.821 --> 02:07:58.390
but there are good politicians with good hearts who are fighting for the

2337
02:07:58.391 --> 02:08:00.100
underdog and for rights because you know,

2338
02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:03.630
even like when we talk about what the patent troll thing [inaudible] was,

2339
02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:05.260
an interesting thing is that,
you know,

2340
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:08.360
when you really are in a jam legally and you realize,
you know,

2341
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:12.310
the cost of it is to get any sort of protection or justice in this country is

2342
02:08:12.311 --> 02:08:14.320
completely stilted in completely fucked up.

2343
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:17.980
That even the court systems are not designed to accommodate,
you know,

2344
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:20.110
just basic human issues anymore.

2345
02:08:20.230 --> 02:08:23.860
It's frightening because when she really hits the fan,
if you don't have bread,

2346
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:26.440
you're fucked.
You're just fucked.
And,
and,

2347
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:29.110
and that's the way that the people with bread like it,

2348
02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:32.440
it's like that's how they can protect their bottom line with bad food,

2349
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:35.320
with anything class action suits,
tort reform.

2350
02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:37.000
I'm just throwing out a bunch of things now,

2351
02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:39.280
but like it's the whole idea that when,
you know,

2352
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:42.460
like corporate corporations would like it if the,

2353
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:46.780
if they would reform the legal system so they could put caps on payouts in

2354
02:08:46.781 --> 02:08:49.090
lawsuits and if that ever happens,

2355
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:52.630
then there's absolutely no justice for anybody because the,

2356
02:08:52.631 --> 02:08:57.220
the whole idea of a lawsuit against a corporation that fucks people is you want

2357
02:08:57.221 --> 02:08:59.020
to hurt them.
So if they can't,

2358
02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:02.020
if you can't hurt them anymore and they can just work it into their bottom line,

2359
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.180
then it's like that Ford Pinto thing.

2360
02:09:04.330 --> 02:09:08.460
Do you recall or do you just pay out to the people that got killed that blow up

2361
02:09:09.130 --> 02:09:10.660
and that is exactly what it is.

2362
02:09:10.661 --> 02:09:13.360
And it's w w we live in a strange time where there's,

2363
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:15.790
there's corporations that have done amazing things.

2364
02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:17.200
They've created amazing products.

2365
02:09:17.201 --> 02:09:19.150
It probably wouldn't get done without those corporations.

2366
02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:23.350
But then there's the lack of humanity that gets sort of a written in the idea

2367
02:09:23.351 --> 02:09:26.560
that they can act as an individual,
they can vote.

2368
02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.820
That's how the,
that's how it's been structured now.

2369
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.540
And it's because this diffusion of responsibility that comes in a giant group

2370
02:09:34.541 --> 02:09:35.800
where the giant group,

2371
02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:38.170
you mean you could be working for Halliburton and making a good living and don't

2372
02:09:38.171 --> 02:09:40.120
feel bad about yourself at all.
Meanwhile,
you're not,

2373
02:09:40.121 --> 02:09:43.120
you fucking companies involved some evil shit,
but it's like the Nazis.

2374
02:09:43.290 --> 02:09:45.850
I thought we were making it better,
but yeah,

2375
02:09:45.851 --> 02:09:48.700
the fact that they're protected and regular people aren't,
is fucking nuts.

2376
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:53.430
Bananas.
And it's a part of our society that,
are you leaving there bu yeah,

2377
02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.770
I got to go.
Where are you going by the comedy store?
Have Fun.
Say Hi Tony.

2378
02:09:57.790 --> 02:10:01.000
I said Hi.
I come to San Diego.
Yeah,
San Diego fuckers.
All right.

2379
02:10:01.001 --> 02:10:04.330
Let me lay out this Kennison story.
Um,
yeah.
Somebody peed in your bed,

2380
02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:08.620
like getting greatest comic of all time during the year where he was the

2381
02:10:08.621 --> 02:10:11.890
greatest.
See Paul where he was the greatest thing.
People have heard this,

2382
02:10:11.891 --> 02:10:15.030
but fuck it.
I,
I mean this is why to me,
this is the,

2383
02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.820
that period of the comedy store in a nutshell.
Cause you've been there,

2384
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:23.470
you know the Vibe,
you know,
bullet hole in that place from Kinison I miss that.

2385
02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:24.250
I miss that.

2386
02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:28.150
I got out right before the guns can't sign was important to me because to know

2387
02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:29.110
that that can happen,

2388
02:10:29.170 --> 02:10:33.560
that someone can shoot something through a fucking sign right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2389
02:10:33.561 --> 02:10:35.660
I missed the gun part.
I got out before this,

2390
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:38.360
it was this moment that got me out and you know,

2391
02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:41.210
coming back to the voices was that there was this guy that used to hang around

2392
02:10:41.211 --> 02:10:44.870
the store.
He was,
he called himself a satanist.
His name was Dave.

2393
02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:47.970
He woke like Christopher Walken and he was a junkie and he used to hang around.

2394
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
You couldn't get him out.
You know,
there are,
those guys are hanging in the store.

2395
02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:52.740
It's like he's not going to,
I can never get rid of them.
Yeah.

2396
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.410
So like he'd hang around,
he had like a pentagram tattooed over his heart.

2397
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.750
He was like this,
you know,
just a fucking nut bag.

2398
02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:04.100
And he was a drug addict,
but he used to hang around and Sam hated him.
Same,

2399
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:07.750
just fucking hated this guy.
Sam was a bit of a bully,
but he really,
he,

2400
02:11:07.751 --> 02:11:12.530
he just didn't want this guy round and you couldn't get rid of him.
So,
you know,

2401
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:14.510
he used to hang around and we'd hang out with them.

2402
02:11:14.511 --> 02:11:17.990
Sometimes he'd get his coke and whatever.
But he was one of those guys,

2403
02:11:18.230 --> 02:11:22.010
he hung around and he was a satanist and you know,
you know,

2404
02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:23.570
you don't really think Satan would be annoying,

2405
02:11:23.571 --> 02:11:28.120
but he wasn't knowing in this particular manifestation.
So one night,
you know,

2406
02:11:28.190 --> 02:11:31.820
I remember Sam and me and Carl,
it was,
I don't remember what we were celebrating,

2407
02:11:31.821 --> 02:11:35.360
but Sam brought all his guitars up to crest hill and him and me and Carl jammed

2408
02:11:35.361 --> 02:11:37.970
out on the patio.
We had an,
so we had guitars and shit.

2409
02:11:37.971 --> 02:11:41.750
We had this big jam session.
We ate food is like a little party.
And then,

2410
02:11:41.751 --> 02:11:44.600
you know,
we had to go to the comedy store or whatever,
but you know,

2411
02:11:44.601 --> 02:11:48.110
all the equipment was in my room.
He just said,
keep this.
I'll come get it later.

2412
02:11:48.590 --> 02:11:51.590
So a couple of days later,
there's a party at the house,

2413
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:54.200
people are showing up Sam's air and it's about 15,

2414
02:11:54.201 --> 02:11:58.820
20 people there and fucking Dave,
the satanist shows up and Sam hates Dave,

2415
02:11:58.821 --> 02:12:00.860
the state and this,
and you know,
I lived there and I was the kid.

2416
02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:04.090
He assigned me to give me money to go buy booze and Shit and get the house
ready.

2417
02:12:04.091 --> 02:12:07.430
Right?
So,
so Dave's there and Samsung are,
and I'm like,
oh,

2418
02:12:07.431 --> 02:12:11.600
this is not gonna be good.
And,
uh,
like in the middle of the party fucking,

2419
02:12:11.630 --> 02:12:13.190
you know,
Dave,
the Satan,
it says,
you know,

2420
02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:17.060
I'm going to tell Anton Lavanya about you and [inaudible] the clown that used to

2421
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:20.720
run the Church of Satan.
He,
I can tell him,
you're not a real satanist.

2422
02:12:21.110 --> 02:12:24.500
And Sam just fucking loses it and just takes a drink and throws it in this guy's

2423
02:12:24.501 --> 02:12:26.240
face and pops him in the fucking head.

2424
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.580
And the guy's shirts all ripped off and there's fucking confusion and people

2425
02:12:29.581 --> 02:12:33.080
were scattering and I'm like,
oh,
fuck.
And like,
you know,

2426
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:35.140
the guy wouldn't leave still.
Like,

2427
02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.090
I pull them outside and I see you've got to get the fuck outta here.
He's like,

2428
02:12:38.091 --> 02:12:40.610
fuck that.
I'm not leaving.
I'm like,
well I gotta go.

2429
02:12:40.730 --> 02:12:44.750
My buddy bill was flying in from Boston to visit me and I told him about

2430
02:12:44.751 --> 02:12:47.300
everything that was going on in La and I was excited for it to happen and he's

2431
02:12:47.301 --> 02:12:49.700
flying in and I'm like,
why you don't got time to deal with you?

2432
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:53.000
So I locked the satanist and my bedroom thinking I'm going to come back and get

2433
02:12:53.001 --> 02:12:56.960
him out after the shit settles.
It's right.
So now the satanist is in my room,

2434
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:58.200
you know,
and,
and,

2435
02:12:58.201 --> 02:13:02.270
and the guitars are in their whatever and I leave somehow is what cocoa do you

2436
02:13:02.271 --> 02:13:03.890
just use chunks.
But I leave,

2437
02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:07.730
I go pick up my friend bill at the airport and I go to his hotel with them and

2438
02:13:07.731 --> 02:13:08.720
crash air cause fucking,

2439
02:13:08.721 --> 02:13:11.120
I won't go back to whenever the fuck is happening at the house.

2440
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.050
And the next morning,
like 10 in the morning,
I drive bill over to the house.

2441
02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:17.510
We walk in and,
and you know,
everyone's gone.

2442
02:13:17.511 --> 02:13:21.230
But Sam and like three other people and they're still doing blow.

2443
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:27.420
Sorry.
It's so light out.
All right.
So you know,
I,
you know,
I,

2444
02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:29.370
I first walked into the kitchen and walked back to the room.

2445
02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:33.300
I see the doors open,
all the guitars are gone.
My bed's fucked up.

2446
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:35.430
Like the door had been broken,
been kicked in

2447
02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.720
because I think whatever.
So it had been kicked in.

2448
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.240
And I then I walk out to the table and I see Sam there.

2449
02:13:42.250 --> 02:13:45.960
My friend Bill Steve had just gotten to town to standing there and Sam looks at

2450
02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:50.460
me and goes,
I pissed on your bed.
Mer.
You want to know why?
And I go,

2451
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:54.990
yeah,
I do.
He goes,
cause you went that fucking moron,
sleep with my guitars.

2452
02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.340
And like,
then there's this word silence.
And I turned to bill and I said,

2453
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:00.480
I told you I knew him

2454
02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:06.870
and that was the last time I slept in that bed.
And uh,
and then like what?

2455
02:14:06.871 --> 02:14:10.680
Ultimately leaving and after he peanut,
no,
no,
no,
no.
So it wasn't the last time.

2456
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:14.480
Last time was before.
That happened.
Right before he keyed it.

2457
02:14:14.730 --> 02:14:18.020
I'm not going to ever,
I'm pissing in any way,
throw some towels down that queue,

2458
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:21.510
I'm going to sleep now.
I,
to me it was like this is territorial fuck guy.
Yeah.

2459
02:14:21.511 --> 02:14:26.430
He peed on your spot.
Shit.
Yeah.
That is a territorial thing.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
you know,

2460
02:14:26.431 --> 02:14:30.360
ultimately what happened is I was still psychotic and I was hearing these voices

2461
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:34.770
and uh,
and I swear to God,
I was sweeping it.
I went to Steve Kravitz's house.

2462
02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:38.040
So when you're going to Steve Kravitz's house to get away from drugs,
you know,

2463
02:14:38.041 --> 02:14:39.380
you're fucked up.
So again,

2464
02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:44.690
so I go to Kravitz House and I'm crashing over there,
there,
you know,
cause he,

2465
02:14:44.691 --> 02:14:46.910
you know,
I think Pearl was going up and down from the bay area.

2466
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:50.400
And so I crashed in a bed there.
And I remember laying there just,
you know,

2467
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:54.480
I literally out loud,
you know,
I was thinking like,
how far out can I go?

2468
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:57.690
And I swear to God on my memory of voice I'd never heard before.

2469
02:14:57.691 --> 02:15:00.060
Clearly in my right ear said,

2470
02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:02.880
you've gone far enough and I fucking left.

2471
02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:04.950
I packed up whatever I could in my car,

2472
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:08.760
I say goodbye to a few of the dudes at the store and I fucking left.

2473
02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:12.450
Like I freaked out in the parking lot of the comedy store,
you know,

2474
02:15:12.451 --> 02:15:15.000
after Sam pissed on my bed and everyone was pissed off at me.

2475
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:19.110
Like I was out in the parking lot and like I was kicked out of the group and I

2476
02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:23.310
was fucking out of my mind.
I'm blow in psychosis and I'm out there and I'm like,

2477
02:15:23.311 --> 02:15:26.040
just sort of like,
you know,
Schubert came up to me,
he's like,
no dude,

2478
02:15:26.041 --> 02:15:29.040
it's going to blow over man.
You just fucked up.
And I'm like,
fuck you.

2479
02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:33.570
You're one of them.
You're fucking one of them breaking glasses,
you know,

2480
02:15:33.571 --> 02:15:37.590
like it's just complete fucking meltdown.
It was sad and I'm like,

2481
02:15:37.591 --> 02:15:40.200
you're all fucked up.
You fuck,
you know,
like I thought,

2482
02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.600
cause me and Schubert were friends.
I thought he had turned on me.

2483
02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:46.830
And then I went up to the drug dealer and I,
and I was like,

2484
02:15:46.831 --> 02:15:51.630
you know which are the permanent mustache?
No,
no,
the Arab.
Oh,
the scary guy.

2485
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:56.730
Oh,
that guy.
Yeah.
Okay.
And I'm like,
uh,
you know,
I don't know what to do man.

2486
02:15:56.850 --> 02:16:00.390
I'm kicked out of the group and he goes,
you gotta,
you gotta get Outta here.

2487
02:16:00.391 --> 02:16:04.080
You guys,
you gotta do your own thing.
If the drug dealers telling you to leave,

2488
02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.560
it's time to like,
and I just fucking left man.

2489
02:16:08.561 --> 02:16:10.890
And I was hearing voices and I drove to my brother's.

2490
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.670
He was going to school in Tucson.
Were the voices saying clear shit?
No.

2491
02:16:14.671 --> 02:16:18.870
It was like,
it's like,
it's almost like a rumbling.
It's almost right.
Yeah.

2492
02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:24.240
More than one.
Wow.
More than one.
Yeah.
It's like almost like a,
you like chatter,

2493
02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:26.460
like a room full of people who aren't converts.
Exactly.

2494
02:16:26.461 --> 02:16:30.040
You're trying to like isolate.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Wow.

2495
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.550
<v 3>But,
but the one time you've gone far enough.
Yeah.
That was clear.
Clear.</v>

2496
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:35.630
I've used probably my better self.
You know,

2497
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:39.280
you ever had other things that it said to you that made sense like that?
No,

2498
02:16:39.281 --> 02:16:44.140
I was GI,
I was really looking for instruction.
I felt like I had

2499
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:50.590
an important assignment the way he said
looking for instruction.

2500
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:51.870
Yeah.
Man,

2501
02:16:51.871 --> 02:16:56.871
this is so fascinating to me because a such a huge fan of and and you know to,

2502
02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:02.020
for you to have been a part of the craziest days of his life ever.

2503
02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:03.820
I think the gun part was a little crazier,

2504
02:17:03.821 --> 02:17:07.110
but the first guy that ever made me think that I could do stand up.
Yeah.

2505
02:17:07.111 --> 02:17:11.800
I never thought I would see like Jerry Seinfeld and I was a big fan of Seinfeld.

2506
02:17:11.801 --> 02:17:15.220
I went to a paid to see him before comedy,
but I was like,
I could never do that.

2507
02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:19.600
It's not me.
But then I saw Kennison I was like,
oh that's comedy too.

2508
02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:22.080
Oh yeah.
Oh comedies.
Weird like comedy.

2509
02:17:22.081 --> 02:17:24.640
He's got like a bunch of different ways to it.

2510
02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:26.760
And then I started considering it when you were around though.
I,

2511
02:17:26.761 --> 02:17:28.690
cause I don't like before I really knew who he was.

2512
02:17:28.691 --> 02:17:32.350
I remember one time he was in Boston and he went to the comedy connection.

2513
02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.780
Do you remember that?
I didn't see him there.
I just saw him.

2514
02:17:34.781 --> 02:17:39.250
But I write Hicks there.
I saw him live,
I saw him live at great woods,

2515
02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:40.333
great woods.

2516
02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:44.470
And I saw him live at some other place when he started sort of fallen off.

2517
02:17:44.471 --> 02:17:46.300
He was getting smaller and smaller places.

2518
02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:49.150
It was in the Cape and it was not that many people there.

2519
02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:53.310
That's a sad arc for me.
It was so important.
It was so important.

2520
02:17:53.310 --> 02:17:57.370
Cause he was,
when I first saw him,
I first saw that special.
I was like,

2521
02:17:57.371 --> 02:18:02.080
Holy Shit.
So for me to see a guy who was that good become that bad,
I was like,

2522
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:05.860
Ooh,
that can happen.
But you got to let that happen.
You've got a window,
man.

2523
02:18:05.861 --> 02:18:10.240
I don't agree with that.
I think some people I've heard Cosby is as good,

2524
02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:13.240
if not better than you have any special.
I've heard he's amazing.

2525
02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:15.970
I can't say that's true.
I think you're right.
You know,
I mean I think,

2526
02:18:15.971 --> 02:18:20.290
I think you can maintain and nourish a career if you don't burn too hard and you

2527
02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:21.480
don't fucking fuck yourself.

2528
02:18:21.481 --> 02:18:24.710
The burn too hard though is a big issue and you can do that without drugs.

2529
02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:27.430
You certainly can,
and I don't want to name any names,

2530
02:18:27.431 --> 02:18:31.120
but I know some comics that at one point in time were great and then two,

2531
02:18:31.121 --> 02:18:34.480
three specials in.
You hear their stuff you'd like,
this is not interesting to me.

2532
02:18:34.481 --> 02:18:37.370
Like what you're talking about is not interesting.
I don't feel any pants hard.

2533
02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:41.320
I think it's hard.
I think like once you get on that schedule where you're like,

2534
02:18:41.321 --> 02:18:44.500
I'm going to do an hour a year.
Like even Carlin,
I mean,
yeah,

2535
02:18:44.501 --> 02:18:47.290
there was a couple of years where you're like,
no,
it's okay.
I wouldn't,

2536
02:18:47.291 --> 02:18:48.580
I would go,
you one better.

2537
02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:51.580
I think there was a couple of years where he was terrible.

2538
02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:56.000
I saw him in mass in New Hampshire.
I went to see him and I'm a huge Carland fan.

2539
02:18:56.001 --> 02:19:00.190
Yeah.
But I went to see him at,
um,
remember that place.
Hampton Beach,

2540
02:19:00.191 --> 02:19:04.030
Hampton Beach Casino,
Eh,
kind of.
I brought my roommates with these knuckleheads,

2541
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:06.400
just starting doing comedy.

2542
02:19:06.401 --> 02:19:11.170
And Carlin was in this weird stage where he would just go onstage and rant about

2543
02:19:11.171 --> 02:19:16.171
things and he had this bit where he would literally just go and fuck the Jews

2544
02:19:16.570 --> 02:19:21.160
and fuck the Nazi's and fuck politics.
I mean that was the whole bit.

2545
02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:24.910
He wasn't,
it was,
he was working on it.
He was like,
fuck comedy clubs,

2546
02:19:24.911 --> 02:19:27.220
I'm not working out my stuff.
Like he would go on stage with pads,

2547
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:31.010
like legal pads.
Yeah.
And it was just like raw ideas and he was working out,

2548
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:33.920
it was almost like he was losing his mind.
He probably was,

2549
02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:37.910
I think he had a pain pill problem.
And I don't know if it coincided with that.

2550
02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:39.500
I don't know if that was around the same time,

2551
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:43.790
but I know that he went into Rehab for pain pills.
Maybe it might've been a fog.

2552
02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:46.700
Chris Rock said something funny about car on.
It's like,
you know,
towards the end,

2553
02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:49.580
you know the later Carlin,
he said,
yeah,
sometimes you know,

2554
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:52.910
he gets caught up with things that don't,
aren't really relatable and Cmo will,

2555
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:57.890
you know,
off,
you know,
off road.
But in every special there's going to be one bit,

2556
02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:01.850
one bit where you like,
damn,
that's a good pit.

2557
02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:06.880
Well that's what I think the real issue with not hashing out your shit over a

2558
02:20:06.881 --> 02:20:07.850
long period of time.

2559
02:20:07.851 --> 02:20:10.840
Cause like if you're trying to bang out a new hour every year you can,
uh,

2560
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:15.580
it's hard to really flesh out these ideas to their maximum.
Sure.
And also as,

2561
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:19.630
as your life becomes a little smaller if you get more successful,
you know,
it,

2562
02:20:19.631 --> 02:20:22.540
it's also relative because my,
you know,
like I've been busy,
you know,

2563
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:25.730
I did the show for IFC and shit and I've never been this busy in my life.

2564
02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:28.640
And your life gets smaller when you get busy.
I mean,
you know,

2565
02:20:28.641 --> 02:20:32.000
you've got to make a point to like sort of get out of your comfort zone and go

2566
02:20:32.001 --> 02:20:33.920
places or think about shit,

2567
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:37.880
have opinions on stuff because when you get busy you're fucking [inaudible].

2568
02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:38.871
It's all right here.

2569
02:20:38.871 --> 02:20:42.230
It's all contained and then you can get really selfish about it.
And then your,

2570
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:45.040
your points of view.
Like I go on trips on purpose.
Like,

2571
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:48.680
I went to Alaska recently.
Fucking amazing.

2572
02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:50.660
I would live there anchorage.
I would live there.

2573
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:54.290
I lived in Anchorage for two years when I was a kid.
I had vague memories of it.

2574
02:20:54.291 --> 02:20:56.180
69 71 my dad was in the,

2575
02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:59.870
in the service and we lived there and I have vague memories of,
you know,

2576
02:20:59.871 --> 02:21:03.600
just a sky and booking salmon and amazing.

2577
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:06.710
I went with Ari,
Ari and I should fear,
oh we did a,

2578
02:21:06.711 --> 02:21:10.130
we did some fishing up there for a couple of days and we did some stand up and

2579
02:21:10.131 --> 02:21:13.610
it was great.
There was,
the best thing about it was the people,

2580
02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.650
the Alaska,

2581
02:21:15.651 --> 02:21:19.130
there's something about people where they have this like sense of community.

2582
02:21:19.350 --> 02:21:22.310
Oh yeah.
Cause freeze to death.
You can get eaten by a bear.

2583
02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:25.760
They're like off the grid in a way.
They're like,
fuck the rest of the world.

2584
02:21:25.761 --> 02:21:29.870
We're going as far away from the rest of it as possible.

2585
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:32.750
But they were very civil and they were also very liberal.

2586
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:35.930
That was one of the interesting things.
They're very progressive.
Like there was,

2587
02:21:35.931 --> 02:21:40.490
um,
Christians for equality and there was this big demonstration for all these

2588
02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:44.630
Christians that were supporting marriage equality and they were like holding up

2589
02:21:44.631 --> 02:21:48.650
these signs and people were honking and I was like,
what a trippy place,
you know,

2590
02:21:48.651 --> 02:21:52.970
this is a trippy place.
Like we,
you know,
we were really impressed.

2591
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:55.790
Ari and I both felt the same way or like this is a pretty radical place.

2592
02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:57.350
I haven't been up there as a grown up.

2593
02:21:57.351 --> 02:22:02.300
I went up to a fair banks wants to do a college gig and I remember it was very

2594
02:22:02.301 --> 02:22:05.210
funny because when you fly into the center of Alaska,
if I'm,

2595
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:08.120
I think that's where I went.
I think it's sort of towards the center bit.

2596
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:11.150
You just flying over Tundra.
I mean there's nothing,
nothing.

2597
02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:14.690
And I remember getting out and I remember asking Ck,
I said,
well,
you know,

2598
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:16.910
you did that Gig,
right?
And He's,
and I'm like,
how is it?

2599
02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:20.220
And he looks at me and goes,
they're just happy you're came there.

2600
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:23.310
They're happy to see you.
And like,

2601
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:26.130
I remember getting picked up by a woman who worked at the school

2602
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:27.840
<v 1>and just driving through nothing.</v>

2603
02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:31.680
And I remember we drove by like these three little apartment buildings that were

2604
02:22:31.681 --> 02:22:34.830
sitting by themselves and she goes to,
that's the bad neighborhood.

2605
02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:43.130
<v 0>That's hilarious.
Yeah.
There's the bad miners.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2606
02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:47.600
Whatever's going on there.
And our kids,
I think as I get older,

2607
02:22:47.601 --> 02:22:49.940
I appreciate smaller and smaller towns.
You know,

2608
02:22:49.941 --> 02:22:54.240
I think where I'm going eventually wound up settling is probably boulder.
Yeah.

2609
02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:57.870
I really liked boulder.
I wonder where to get out area.

2610
02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:02.870
I think also what you're doing now,
my children,
my family,

2611
02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:06.810
my wife,
um,
and the podcast and my friends.
There's,

2612
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:10.120
I have a lot of friends here and you know,
all,
all my best friends live.
Right.

2613
02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:12.950
Right.
And one of the things that I did realize,

2614
02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:14.690
even though I only lived in Colorado for a few months,

2615
02:23:14.691 --> 02:23:16.760
I lived there for about three months,
about four years ago.

2616
02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:20.220
But one of the things that I,
uh,
I really,
uh,
realize about it is I,

2617
02:23:20.221 --> 02:23:22.970
I really missed my friends when I have,

2618
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.270
when you have a lot of people in your life that you,
you get a lot out of,

2619
02:23:26.271 --> 02:23:26.511
you know,

2620
02:23:26.511 --> 02:23:30.560
you get a lot of happiness and friendship and when those people aren't around,

2621
02:23:30.561 --> 02:23:32.510
it's like,
Ooh,
this is kind of weird.
You know,

2622
02:23:32.511 --> 02:23:34.250
like now all of a sudden I'm in this new place

2623
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.450
<v 1>and you and you,
you don't have the,
the,
the,
yeah.</v>

2624
02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:41.990
I don't know because I think like,
I,
I'd like to live someplace simpler,

2625
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:46.640
but like,
I'm sort of tethered here because of the way that my,
the work is going.

2626
02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:50.330
But like there's this fantasy about it.
Yeah.
Cause I,
I don't have enough fun.

2627
02:23:50.331 --> 02:23:51.350
I don't hang out enough.

2628
02:23:51.530 --> 02:23:55.250
Like I just went to Seattle for this sub pop silver jubilee thing and I was

2629
02:23:55.251 --> 02:23:59.990
hanging out with Eugene Mirman,
Jon Glaser,
John Benjamin,
uh,
and uh,

2630
02:23:59.991 --> 02:24:03.410
and we went and saw music but that,
but those guys I had forgotten,
man,

2631
02:24:03.411 --> 02:24:07.790
I fucking laughed so fucking much.
Glazer and Benjamin are fucking hilarious.

2632
02:24:07.850 --> 02:24:11.900
I don't know them.
They,
uh,
well he,
Jon Benjamin,
he's done a lot of voice work.

2633
02:24:11.901 --> 02:24:15.820
He's on Bob's burgers.
He did.
He was the son on Doctor Katz.
He also did a,

2634
02:24:15.890 --> 02:24:20.870
Jon Benjamin has a van on a comedy central.
He's gotten Glazer's also.

2635
02:24:20.871 --> 02:24:24.470
He used to write for Conan and he's done,
he does d located on comedy central,

2636
02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:28.550
that show with the guy who's in the witness protection program.
I don't know.

2637
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:32.780
They're not standups per se,
but their comic guys and they do bits,
well no,

2638
02:24:32.781 --> 02:24:35.570
they did a bit,
they did this weird bit.
They're improvisers in a way,

2639
02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:39.990
but fucking dude,
it was just like,
I'd forgotten.
Like I was just hysterical for,

2640
02:24:39.991 --> 02:24:43.550
for an hour.
Like,
you know when you really laughed.
Oh yeah.
And then I think like,

2641
02:24:43.551 --> 02:24:47.720
why the fuck am I not doing this more?
You know,

2642
02:24:47.730 --> 02:24:49.190
like got to get out and be like,
and then you,

2643
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:50.690
and then you've got to go through the list of people.

2644
02:24:50.691 --> 02:24:53.120
That makes me laugh that much.
Well,
that's a shorter listen,
I thought,

2645
02:24:53.490 --> 02:24:55.070
and I don't wanna get too far away from them.

2646
02:24:55.310 --> 02:24:55.521
<v 0>Well,</v>

2647
02:24:55.521 --> 02:24:58.370
I had one of the best times I had recently was a Stan hope and I were in the

2648
02:24:58.371 --> 02:25:02.030
same town just coincidentally.
We were both in Cincinnati at the same time.

2649
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:06.830
So after my show was over,
I drove to his show and watched his show.

2650
02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:09.440
And then afterwards we went next door and tended bar.

2651
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:14.180
We tended bar together and uh,
I was pouring people drinks.

2652
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:16.370
I don't know how to make drinks.
I was just pouring,

2653
02:25:16.371 --> 02:25:17.990
it was pouring people a lot of shots of whiskey.

2654
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:21.710
And I know the bar wasn't getting enough money so I wasn't collecting any money.

2655
02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:24.040
Right.
So then I would take some money of my wallet,
just

2656
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.860
<v 2>throw it into the tail,
just like,
here's 100 bucks,</v>

2657
02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:30.550
depending on what I just gave away.
It was craziness.
It was fun.

2658
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:34.030
Cause it's Cincinnati,
you know,
it's not la,
right.
There's some,

2659
02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:38.080
there's things you,
things that you can do is fun.

2660
02:25:38.081 --> 02:25:42.500
You can have in a smaller place that you just can't have in this month's trust.

2661
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:44.960
Monstrous.
I don't even know.
Propolis.
Yeah.

2662
02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:48.010
I don't even like I right now I'm just trying to,
you know,
we were going to,

2663
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:51.250
I was going to try to get a little bigger house cause I got the,
the woman,

2664
02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:51.521
you know,

2665
02:25:51.521 --> 02:25:54.790
I'm going to get married again and she apparently needs a second bathroom.

2666
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:55.930
I live in a fucking cabin.

2667
02:25:56.170 --> 02:25:59.290
I've got a two bedroom house up on a hill and I've been to your place,

2668
02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:04.360
but you know,
chicks the place though.
It's a nice neighborhood.
Nice.
Okay.

2669
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:07.260
So I think we're going to build on,
that's what we're doing know in the backyard.

2670
02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:10.080
Yeah.
Oh that's cool.
I'm going to try that on too,
because you know,

2671
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:13.210
it's like you create something together.
You don't just need to,
I need to,

2672
02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:17.560
I gotta erase whatever remnants or are the ex wife,
oh,
that's whatever.

2673
02:26:17.561 --> 02:26:21.280
Reminders.
She tried to steal that from you,
didn't she?
Yeah,
but she couldn't.

2674
02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:22.510
Beautiful.

2675
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:25.330
It was the end of that funny though that someone would try to steal your house.

2676
02:26:25.390 --> 02:26:29.110
Dude,
it's some woman you put your penis in.
She's like,
I'd like your house.

2677
02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:33.340
It's horrible.
It's horrible.
Like I gotta be honest with you.
I mean,

2678
02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:37.840
that whole process that almost killed me.
I believe it.

2679
02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:41.650
And that the,
the only gift of it was if it was that,
you know,

2680
02:26:41.651 --> 02:26:44.230
I bought that thing before we were married.
We were together,

2681
02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:47.020
but it was in my name and there was nothing she could do legal,

2682
02:26:47.021 --> 02:26:50.000
she's trying to get you to put it in her name,
right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2683
02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.860
That's so scary,
man.
And I knew it though.
I knew it innately.
Like you,
you know,

2684
02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:56.470
like,
you know when a calculation,
yeah.
Because all I would say is like,

2685
02:26:56.471 --> 02:26:59.110
what difference does it make?
We're married with different,
you know,

2686
02:26:59.111 --> 02:27:00.490
what difference does it make?
Right.

2687
02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.670
And I kept pushing it off and I'm so fucking grateful.

2688
02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:06.100
She almost bankrupted me out of it.
But uh,

2689
02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:09.730
but he tried to bleed you by prolonging lawyers do,

2690
02:27:09.970 --> 02:27:11.680
you don't even know how much it is them.

2691
02:27:11.681 --> 02:27:15.820
Because like the weird thing about divorce is that,
you know,
both sides,

2692
02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:19.430
my attorney and their attorney and her attorney,
they're just wanted,

2693
02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:22.810
they were just running money through you.
So you don't know who to trust.
Really.

2694
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:23.561
The big,
you know,

2695
02:27:23.561 --> 02:27:28.180
if you ever get divorced to best thing you can fucking do is just agree

2696
02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:31.060
together.
You know what,
how are we going to do this?

2697
02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:35.260
You know what mediate because as soon as someone gets a lawyer involved,

2698
02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.120
they're like,
they're almost like pimps.

2699
02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:40.660
They'll turn that person out and they'll put ideas in their head that they

2700
02:27:40.661 --> 02:27:44.200
didn't have before and they've got every angle possible cause whoever's got the

2701
02:27:44.201 --> 02:27:47.820
money,
that's the money that's going to run through both,
you know,
you know,

2702
02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:51.460
profit and resolving things.
They profit and arguing and dre dragging them out.

2703
02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:54.970
But also they fill the minds up with this sort of like,
oh,
he's hiding money.

2704
02:27:54.971 --> 02:27:58.630
I'm like,
I think money,
you know,
like I didn't even have that much money.

2705
02:27:58.631 --> 02:27:59.500
I mean I had money,

2706
02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:04.480
but like if you can somehow she threw the fucking anger and bullshit just to

2707
02:28:04.481 --> 02:28:08.710
fucking media.
Even if it gets ugly,
as soon as you both,
you know,
lawyer up,

2708
02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:09.603
you're fucked.

2709
02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.230
All your money's going to go to pay for her defense to pay for your defense.

2710
02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:17.260
Whoever's got the money,
that money's going to go out.

2711
02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:22.190
I had a whole bit about it because I watched a friend lose.
I mean he

2712
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:26.390
<v 3>was a very wealthy guy and he lost a giant chunk of everything that he earned</v>

2713
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:30.290
over a long marriage.
She was in a marriage for like 15 years,
no children,

2714
02:28:30.291 --> 02:28:32.600
nothing.
And it was that thing where the merit,

2715
02:28:32.601 --> 02:28:34.670
the divorce took more than a year and a half.

2716
02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:37.670
And I know it didn't even go to them.
No,
they all went to the,

2717
02:28:37.810 --> 02:28:41.000
went to the lawyers.
That's it.
Man.
And his wife did it on purpose.

2718
02:28:41.001 --> 02:28:44.180
Like she wanted to meet him.
He was paying for her lawyer as well.

2719
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:47.210
The guy's got the money going to pay for everything.
That's what's incredible.

2720
02:28:47.211 --> 02:28:50.030
It's like going to war and you're paying for the enemy's general.
Yeah,

2721
02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.170
I mean it was insane.

2722
02:28:51.171 --> 02:28:54.350
I watched my friend like literally get to the point of murder,

2723
02:28:54.351 --> 02:28:56.330
suicide and it's insanity,

2724
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:59.480
losing everything and you can't stop it and still working.

2725
02:28:59.510 --> 02:29:03.110
It's still working every day.
He had a regular job,
so he's working every day,

2726
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:07.160
you know,
eight,
nine,
10 hours a day and all of it's going all of it.

2727
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:09.560
It's the only resources.
You can't stop it.

2728
02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:12.140
That's the fucked up thing is like every time you think like,
okay,

2729
02:29:12.141 --> 02:29:14.390
so this is going to finish,
then your lawyer will go,
no,

2730
02:29:14.391 --> 02:29:17.750
but they can always do this.
I'm like,
why didn't you tell me about that before?

2731
02:29:17.770 --> 02:29:21.740
Right?
So now what does that even mean?
Right?
Because here's how divorces end.

2732
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:26.530
Whoever's got the money goes,
all right,
how much?
How much does it,

2733
02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.600
how would you going to take to stop this?
Look at you.
You can so fired up.

2734
02:29:29.601 --> 02:29:30.434
Look at your eyes.

2735
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:35.180
You have a fucking inferno behind your eyes when I don't talk about it anymore

2736
02:29:35.390 --> 02:29:39.230
because I know why we didn't talk about,
I know why the marriage went to shit.

2737
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:42.170
You know?
And I can own my side of that,
but I do.

2738
02:29:42.171 --> 02:29:47.030
I cannot forgive her for what she put.
Know what you mean?
Yeah,
no,

2739
02:29:47.031 --> 02:29:47.790
I know what you mean.

2740
02:29:47.790 --> 02:29:50.780
It's the saddest thing in the world when someone you used to love turns against

2741
02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:54.590
you,
um,
like,
and you become the enemy.
I've seen it happen with people.

2742
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:58.640
I've seen it happen on both sides,
men and women.
And this is the weirdest,

2743
02:29:58.641 --> 02:30:00.440
saddest,
most horrific thing.

2744
02:30:00.441 --> 02:30:05.441
This violent springback from ultimate love to you becoming the enemy.

2745
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:06.110
Don't,

2746
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:10.970
don't underestimate the power of the lawyers to prey on the vulnerability of

2747
02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:16.040
that.
See,
what happens is like,
I don't know necessarily that my wife said,

2748
02:30:16.041 --> 02:30:17.930
you know,
I want everything I know.

2749
02:30:17.931 --> 02:30:20.900
She felt she entitled it the House and I knew I wasn't going to give that up.

2750
02:30:20.930 --> 02:30:25.610
That's so crazy that someone feels entitled to Your House.
Well,
she lived there.

2751
02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:29.090
She decorated it.
I know.

2752
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:32.540
How was somewhat entitled to Your House if you to live there for free.
I know.

2753
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:37.430
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah.
That's amazing.
To me.
It's,
it's,
it's fucking horrifying.

2754
02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:40.790
But you can't,
the decline disclosure process,
all these tactics,

2755
02:30:40.970 --> 02:30:45.970
like I spent a year just making copies of fucking electric bills,

2756
02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:50.750
bank statements,
fucking like,
because when you have a business,
you know,

2757
02:30:50.751 --> 02:30:53.150
you run a lot of money through the business because you can,
right?

2758
02:30:53.151 --> 02:30:56.360
Because he's a business expenses and then you pay yourself at the end of your

2759
02:30:56.361 --> 02:31:00.470
business here.
So like that's your money.
But see this way or said no,

2760
02:31:00.471 --> 02:31:03.860
like all the money that he had coming in business or otherwise you're entitled,

2761
02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:07.910
you know,
so now I'm fucking,
I'm going to Kinko's with boxes of Shit,

2762
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:11.060
you know,
and they subpoenaed this shit and they we,

2763
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:14.060
and it's like it's a fucking nightmare.
Becomes your day.

2764
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:15.440
I've never been more organized,

2765
02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.040
but you know what?

2766
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:24.340
<v 2>I love relationships.
I love love but legal when you,
you,</v>

2767
02:31:24.350 --> 02:31:27.690
you connect the legal system to love.

2768
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:30.650
I mean I have friends that don't have girlfriends and he doesn't,

2769
02:31:30.651 --> 02:31:33.510
don't have someone they're close to and they don't have good friends.

2770
02:31:33.511 --> 02:31:35.550
And when I watched that,
it's,

2771
02:31:35.551 --> 02:31:38.910
it's a weird thing to see someone where I know there's a deficit in

2772
02:31:38.911 --> 02:31:41.900
companionship,
whether it's boyfriend,
girlfriend or whatever,

2773
02:31:41.901 --> 02:31:43.740
it's buddies or whether it's,
there's a,

2774
02:31:43.741 --> 02:31:46.080
there's some people who have deficits and companionship,

2775
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:50.070
but when you come connect friendship and money,

2776
02:31:50.340 --> 02:31:55.140
when even when two people who were buddies have some sort of a contract together

2777
02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:57.480
and one person leaves,
the other person has to pay them.

2778
02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:00.840
Could you imagine if you had a best friend and the the deal with the best friend

2779
02:32:00.841 --> 02:32:04.110
is,
yeah,
man,
let's fucking become roommates.
All right dude.
Hey man,

2780
02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:07.410
we're roommates.
Fucking love each other,
right?
Yeah.
Signed some shit right here.

2781
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:09.660
So on this shit right here.
Yeah.
And if we don't,

2782
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:13.170
not any friends anymore and then,
you know,
we just have to work it out.

2783
02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:15.450
See how much of your shit I can get from you.

2784
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:19.880
Like what the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah.
That happiness to someone.

2785
02:32:19.890 --> 02:32:23.760
They're like,
hmm,
that does make sense.
I should probably connect to you legally.

2786
02:32:23.790 --> 02:32:26.340
It's also had these walls are exploited because the one thing I didn't know

2787
02:32:26.341 --> 02:32:29.370
about,
well you know,
after all was said and done was there like,
you know,

2788
02:32:29.371 --> 02:32:32.900
when I thought things were like starting to look up there,
you're good at,

2789
02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:36.730
the money's going to get fucking tapped no matter what.
You know,

2790
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:39.210
I was able to keep the house,
but it was that close.
I mean,

2791
02:32:39.211 --> 02:32:41.160
I had a call my fucking mother

2792
02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:46.140
to borrow fucking money in the last thing,
you know,
towards the end of it,

2793
02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:49.350
like ours tapped off illegal stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2794
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:53.070
And ultimately what happens is then after all said and done,

2795
02:32:53.071 --> 02:32:55.050
then it's sort of like you got to do what spousal support.

2796
02:32:55.051 --> 02:32:56.640
Now this is the fucking yeah.

2797
02:32:56.870 --> 02:33:00.000
That you have to send money to someone who's trying to break you and steal your

2798
02:33:00.001 --> 02:33:03.880
house.
Even if there's no kids,
they're entitled to half a,
you know,

2799
02:33:03.930 --> 02:33:06.750
to spousal support for half of the term of the marriage.

2800
02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:08.910
Now originally when that was put in place,

2801
02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:12.000
it made sense because if you had a woman who was,
you know,

2802
02:33:12.001 --> 02:33:14.790
doing the standard housewife thing for 25 years,

2803
02:33:14.970 --> 02:33:17.190
her old man finds a younger chick and cuts her loose.

2804
02:33:17.310 --> 02:33:18.750
She got no way to enter the world.

2805
02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:22.500
So like I can see how the law made sense were women that like,
you know,
if the,

2806
02:33:22.501 --> 02:33:25.440
if the,
if the dude says I'm done,
I'm going to go fuck her.

2807
02:33:25.530 --> 02:33:29.580
She's the only one working.
Yeah.
Basically.
You know,
but she,
well,

2808
02:33:29.581 --> 02:33:32.010
she worked and she was writing and she was doing her standup and stuff,

2809
02:33:32.011 --> 02:33:35.940
but the spousal support thing gets exploited,
you know,
because like it's,
it,

2810
02:33:35.941 --> 02:33:39.090
you know,
she can earn money.
She is a person that can live in the world.

2811
02:33:39.210 --> 02:33:42.690
We weren't married 25 years.
I didn't take her out of the workforce.

2812
02:33:42.930 --> 02:33:45.870
So they exploit that to,
and they try to maximize that shit.

2813
02:33:46.410 --> 02:33:48.480
Ultimately what happened was I took a Gig,

2814
02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:52.650
like I was done with Air America and I was fucking going broke.

2815
02:33:52.651 --> 02:33:53.520
And that was when I was,
you know,

2816
02:33:53.521 --> 02:33:56.250
it was before the podcast and I was fucking miserable.
And I was like,

2817
02:33:56.251 --> 02:33:57.210
I was going down,

2818
02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:02.010
I had to call my mother for to loan me money and I took this Gig,
uh,
you know,

2819
02:34:02.011 --> 02:34:05.280
a new version of Air America where they had some money and they,

2820
02:34:05.281 --> 02:34:07.490
in someone who was part of the older American said,

2821
02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:11.280
let's try to do a streaming video show.
So me and Cedar did it,
you know,

2822
02:34:11.310 --> 02:34:12.121
they wanted me on my own,

2823
02:34:12.121 --> 02:34:15.280
but I was too fucking emotionally broken to fucking deal with the job.

2824
02:34:15.281 --> 02:34:17.680
But all I said going in and said,
look,
all I need,

2825
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:21.580
I need you to give me this amount of money so I can stop hemorrhaging money to

2826
02:34:21.581 --> 02:34:25.060
this fucking idiot.
And you know,
so that was part of my deal.
I said,

2827
02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:28.370
you give me this money upfront so I can stop this.
Wow.

2828
02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:31.750
So like no matter what justice you think you're going to get or whatever you and

2829
02:34:31.751 --> 02:34:35.590
everyone ends up losing.
So basically it came down to I,
I called her up,
I said,

2830
02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:39.550
how much do you need to stop this?

2831
02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:45.780
How much was it at that time it was like 50 or 60 k o

2832
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:51.470
<v 3>oh,
it's so crazy.
That's so crazy.</v>

2833
02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:55.010
It's so crazy.
And it happens to fucking everyone.

2834
02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:57.290
And the only way I was able to frame this ultimately,

2835
02:34:57.291 --> 02:34:59.030
it was funny because you know,

2836
02:34:59.031 --> 02:35:03.800
I loved her and she also introduced me to,
you know,
sobriety I can,

2837
02:35:03.801 --> 02:35:07.760
when she met me,
I was pretty much a mess and she got me into that groove,

2838
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:09.380
you know,
into the recovery groups.
So,
you know,

2839
02:35:09.381 --> 02:35:13.610
she got me like I got sober so I could get her pussy.
Like,

2840
02:35:13.611 --> 02:35:15.990
you know that like I wasn't really thinking about getting sober,

2841
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:18.770
<v 2>but when she said,
you know,
you're,
you,
you know,
I know who you are,</v>

2842
02:35:18.771 --> 02:35:21.740
you are great and now you look like you're dying,
you know,
do you need help?

2843
02:35:21.741 --> 02:35:23.650
And I'm like,
I ain't anything that I can,

2844
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:30.330
<v 3>I'll eat fucking [inaudible] backer man with you.</v>

2845
02:35:30.370 --> 02:35:32.720
That's just going to follow you home.
And I was married at the time.
I'm like,

2846
02:35:32.721 --> 02:35:33.554
I'm going to leave her.

2847
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:38.620
<v 2>So like,
you know,
and I'm still sober.
So like on some,</v>

2848
02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.260
on some level I owe her a debt for that.
Right.

2849
02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:44.370
So I remember like during the divorce,
after it was all done,
you know,

2850
02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:48.970
Geraldo was still alive and I know he'd been battling drugs for years and I knew

2851
02:35:48.971 --> 02:35:51.340
how much a divorce costs me,
you know,
all in all.

2852
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:53.410
And I remember saying to him at the cellar,
I'm like,

2853
02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.800
so you've been in Rehab a few times,

2854
02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:59.110
like how much money do you think you've spent,
you know,
on Rehab,
you know,

2855
02:35:59.111 --> 02:36:01.960
in your life to try to get sober?
And he's like,
I don't know,

2856
02:36:01.961 --> 02:36:05.410
probably about 200 k.
I'm like,
all right,
I,
okay,

2857
02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:07.020
I'm going to look at that as that kind of spending.

2858
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:10.900
I'm going to rationalize it.

2859
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:15.910
<v 3>That was
exactly the same just to get me out of trouble.</v>

2860
02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.160
Oh well listen man,
I'm glad you pulled through it.
You're a success story.

2861
02:36:21.550 --> 02:36:24.100
You know,
you really are.
You know,
you're,
you're a,

2862
02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:28.210
you're a guy who figured out what you were doing wrong and you're a different

2863
02:36:28.211 --> 02:36:30.490
guy because of that,
like you're different,
interact with,

2864
02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:33.280
and it's been nice watching you have success.

2865
02:36:33.281 --> 02:36:37.280
It's been nice seeing you become this like softer,
easier to deal with.

2866
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.330
<v 2>I appreciate that.
It's been cool.
I mean,</v>

2867
02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:43.240
and I think even since we last talked on microphones,
it's,
I've gotten better.

2868
02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:46.530
<v 3>Well,
I think we needed to have a conversation for sure.
We needed,</v>

2869
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:47.400
we didn't know each other,
right?

2870
02:36:47.730 --> 02:36:49.650
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
But I think that,
you know,</v>

2871
02:36:49.651 --> 02:36:53.280
I had some idea in my head that you know,

2872
02:36:53.281 --> 02:36:57.150
that you know you very earnestly and,
and,
and reasonably fought you.

2873
02:36:57.151 --> 02:37:02.151
Basically you were talking to me fighting my insistence that my idea of who you

2874
02:37:02.281 --> 02:37:05.510
were was really you and you were literally like,
yeah,

2875
02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.960
I don't know what you've made up something.
Well,
you also had to talk to Andy.

2876
02:37:09.961 --> 02:37:14.880
Dick can flavor things in different ways,
but there was also a weird,

2877
02:37:15.490 --> 02:37:16.190
we have just

2878
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:18.050
<v 0>because of who we were over the years.
But I,
I'm,</v>

2879
02:37:18.051 --> 02:37:20.350
I'm glad we were able to do this and this finally happened.
I'm glad too.

2880
02:37:20.351 --> 02:37:23.390
There's a lot of fun.
Let's say more often.
Anytime we,

2881
02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:25.550
you and I can talk for days like this.
Absolutely.

2882
02:37:25.551 --> 02:37:27.030
Have to stop now because we're running out of time.
It was,

2883
02:37:27.031 --> 02:37:30.170
we were out at the end of three hours.
Yeah,
we're at the end of it.
Well,

2884
02:37:30.171 --> 02:37:33.650
thanks for having me.
Please.
Uh,
what the fuck would mark Marin,
uh,

2885
02:37:33.651 --> 02:37:35.660
that's the podcast.
Check it out,
download it.

2886
02:37:35.661 --> 02:37:38.750
He's got how many episodes you have now?
Over 400.

2887
02:37:38.751 --> 02:37:40.520
The most recent 50 are always available.

2888
02:37:40.521 --> 02:37:42.680
I think I got right and what's going up on Thursday?

2889
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:46.600
I'm doing a live one from Boston and I put Jonah Hill up last week and I had to

2890
02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:49.790
run around today.
Mike Eagle,
beautiful alternative snapper.

2891
02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:53.990
You have 50 that are available for free and then,
and then you can get the cast.

2892
02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:57.200
You can get the APP,
go to WTF pod.
Dot.
How much does the APP cost?
Well,

2893
02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:59.900
you get a free app and then if it's like for a year it's like eight bucks.

2894
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:02.360
You can stream all 400 beautiful,
beautiful.

2895
02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:04.160
And you know for people who are doing it's food to him,

2896
02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:06.980
let me tell you something.
Bandwidth is expensive.

2897
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:10.910
It gets really weird in the podcast world and we are working,
we're working,

2898
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:14.830
we're working over here.
We're giving you 50 for free.
You fuck.
Yeah.

2899
02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:18.350
That's the model that Dan Carlin uses as well.
You ever have him on your podcast?

2900
02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:22.650
Oh,
it's my favorite.
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.
He's a historian.
Yeah,

2901
02:38:22.700 --> 02:38:26.420
he's got the fucking most brilliant podcast online.
A fucking check it out.

2902
02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.880
You mean get the wrath of the cons of all about Gingiss con.

2903
02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:33.440
It's fucking credit.
I need to learn more.

2904
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:38.470
It's like five hours of amazing black book on tape about Gang Iskcon and it gets

2905
02:38:39.291 --> 02:38:43.850
back in it.
I got to get out of me and out into the world again.
I'm doing it.

2906
02:38:43.851 --> 02:38:45.860
I'm doing it.
All right.
What the what the fuck?

the informational tweets too.
I mean,

2927
02:40:02.211 --> 02:40:06.590
I think some people yesterday on Twitter just because I checked my Twitter and I

2928
02:40:06.591 --> 02:40:11.591
had like a hundred bad ass stories and articles that people were posting and

2929
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:14.280
connecting me to things and I retweet as many of them that I think that are

2930
02:40:14.281 --> 02:40:17.250
really interesting,
but thanks a lot.
It's amazing.
It's a,

2932
02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:24.420
wanted to let everybody know.
I appreciate the fuck out of it.
All right.

Thank you.
