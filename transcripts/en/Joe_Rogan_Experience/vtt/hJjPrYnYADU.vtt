00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>when you started lifting weights when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were 12,</v>

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 12th grade and you want more like a </v>

4
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>ninth or 10th?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninth to 10th grade.</v>

5
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:10.734
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early to when you stopped taking the </v>

6
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:12.504
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you feel like the exercise did for </v>

7
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>you what the pills were kind of supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do for you?</v>

8
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>The weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

11
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:22.144
<v Speaker 1>this coach he's mentioned in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>article that you were talking about the </v>

12
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Mr Pepperman and he is,</v>

13
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

14
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I was in his car pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a Vietnam vet.</v>

15
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he once said to me,</v>

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I have to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

17
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a skinny little faggot.</v>

18
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

19
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.063
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you how to lift </v>

20
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:42.391
<v Speaker 1>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

21
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more attention than my dad gave me.</v>

22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.023
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

23
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And so he taught me compound lifts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the school gym.</v>

24
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So I bought a sears and Roebuck sand </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill the weights set,</v>

25
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>which I couldn't drag too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom's station,</v>

26
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>a VW fastback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually I did buy three months of</v>

27
00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:58.134
<v Speaker 1>that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm fairly throwing it across the </v>

28
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>room cause you know you're growing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

29
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>like your muscles are recovering </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>

30
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>You just do the same workout every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even feel it.</v>

31
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.853
<v Speaker 1>And he said you're not allowed to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at yourself until Christmas break after </v>

32
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Christmas exams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was like in September.</v>

33
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.543
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything he told me to and then </v>

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>he dropped me off before the Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

35
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>He said now today you can look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the mirror.</v>

36
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.523
<v Speaker 1>And I ran home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ran home and I tore my stupid </v>

37
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>school uniform off and I stood in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror and my body had definition.</v>

38
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.383
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

39
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.313
<v Speaker 1>those are packs of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I looked like I was a guy </v>

40
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>who lifted some weights and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was self validating like wow,</v>

41
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

42
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at myself going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

43
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.593
<v Speaker 1>No one can lift those weights for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the feeling of achievement it gave </v>

44
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:46.524
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I accomplished that was a shot in </v>

45
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>the arm that I still feel to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mile.</v>

46
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause it was so like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this.</v>

47
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Because every other time trying to meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls at the school dance,</v>

49
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I had no guts to talk to the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were alien creatures.</v>

50
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do well in school so you can </v>

51
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:06.504
<v Speaker 1>make fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't throw the ball straight so </v>

52
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>they would throw it at my head to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>me run.</v>

53
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't have any traction </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

54
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>And then when I had the weights I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

55
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm filling out my tee shirt,</v>

56
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noticeable improvement.</v>

57
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.264
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost effort equals results and I </v>

58
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:25.404
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make my grades better cause I </v>

59
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:27.411
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>was all of Swahili to me as a school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And was this let twos to,</v>

61
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>it's probably too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

62
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not good at sitting still.</v>

63
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>But when I had the summer jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I kicked ass.</v>

64
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>I never had an allowance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

65
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>when my mom said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never said,</v>

66
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>here's 20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

67
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>where'd Henry Go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got three jobs over the weekend.</v>

68
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up in the morning,</v>

69
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>go to the pet shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work all day.</v>

70
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>They're run home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do the night shift at the movie theater,</v>

72
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.050

<v Speaker 1>suburbs and,</v>

73
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>and repair skateboards and whatever on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sundays.</v>

74
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>So I always had pocket money because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

75
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I liked having working a cash register </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my key chain in school.</v>

76
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:06.394
<v Speaker 1>I had the keys to stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses trusted me cause I'd never steal </v>

77
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.070
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would work like,</v>

78
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 hours a week and go to school in</v>

79
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that was informed by the </v>

80
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.094
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like getting out of the house and </v>

81
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>being responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in school it didn't mean much to me,</v>

82
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but showing up on time at the pet shop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cleaning out 20 cat pans,</v>

83
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

84
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I had to be there at eight o'clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not eight oh one man,</v>

85
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>because we got things to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt a real fealty.</v>

86
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm ever on a film shoot,</v>

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Like where can I go now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how I,</v>

102
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I live to achieve and to output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

103
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a thing on my computer,</v>

104
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>it's called the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I keep a list of like every show,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every book I've written,</v>

106
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.820

<v Speaker 1>every album I've ever made.</v>

107
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intense.</v>

108
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like you keep a list of every show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've ever done.</v>

109
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.510

<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody who does that.</v>

111
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I write down the set </v>

112
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take a lot of notes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So why do you record it then?</v>

130
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.564
<v Speaker 1>Why do you write all that stuff down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like leaving a good trail of evidence </v>

131
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.920

<v Speaker 1>as a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just</v>

148
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.350
<v Speaker 2>some people could look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>something like that will change the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>a person looks at the world.</v>

154
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 2>To know that someone like Henry Rollins </v>
<v Speaker 2>is out there recording every single show</v>

<v Speaker 2>getting this feeling when I'm talking to</v>

157
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to go do something for real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to fucking accomplish something.</v>

161
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 2>Like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something that I like when I </v>

162
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 2>talked to people that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated and really passionate it,</v>

163
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>it gets me fired up and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

164
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to you talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and I want to go do something.</v>

165
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

166
00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>that's all you get to do in life and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to do stuff and then you die.</v>

167
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over and it's over fast enough.</v>

168
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

169
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't tell people</v>

170
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 2>this is a very compelling and attractive</v>
<v Speaker 2>a attitude you have though.</v>

171
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interest.</v>

172
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps me going and it never gets,</v>

173
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I never get to that point where I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to enough places where I've written</v>

174
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:02.494
<v Speaker 1>enough books or have done enough radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows or I bought enough records is </v>

175
00:07:05.981 --> 00:07:06.814
<v Speaker 1>never enough records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never enough time to do </v>

176
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like living with that kind of,</v>

177
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.354
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of desperation who you're always </v>

178
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:17.021
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

179
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

180
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked that because it keeps the,</v>

181
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.723
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps the blood thin and it keeps </v>

182
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>complacency at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my bad days.</v>

183
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else?</v>

184
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>burnt your bad days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably ridiculous.</v>

186
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 2>You're burning so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

187
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:34.814
<v Speaker 2>your bad days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably like an average ambitious </v>

188
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 2>persons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 2>quality time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

190
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

191
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:40.950
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

192
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:41.610
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

193
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I picked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I work with.</v>

194
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Like today you met Heidi who manages not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only me,</v>

195
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but all my companies and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

196
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.153
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she and I had been working together for </v>

197
00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Damn near 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's amazing.</v>

198
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And she's air traffic control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I'm not,</v>

199
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm never careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say yes to every damn thing.</v>

200
00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say yes to that because you're</v>

201
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:05.274
<v Speaker 1>going to be over here on this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes like to stop answering the </v>

202
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

203
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.993
<v Speaker 1>So she like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the one who coordinated all this </v>

204
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

205
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

206
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

207
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go and do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not good at setting it up.</v>

208
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.633
<v Speaker 1>And so she locks in the coordinates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I work with people who are used </v>

209
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 1>to kind of my velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the road manager.</v>

210
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.943
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way I'm very easy on road manager </v>

211
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:30.630
<v Speaker 1>ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

212
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.463
<v Speaker 1>I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the front of the bus and he's </v>

213
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>already written out the map for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk to a gym.</v>

214
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.433
<v Speaker 1>So I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go right to the gym and I always want </v>

215
00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to gym,</v>

216
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I want this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to Gig.</v>

217
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And then I want some Sushi and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to sleep.</v>

218
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

219
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's intense and there's hardly any days</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

220
00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:52.611
<v Speaker 1>So he knows how to keep all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and the phone is ringing because I</v>

221
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:54.624
<v Speaker 1>work in different media all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Heidi is always juggling </v>

222
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.053
<v Speaker 1>chainsaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm around people who can allow </v>

223
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:06.321
<v Speaker 1>me just to really run at it and go as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and as hard as I want to.</v>

224
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I call it living at the speed of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just kind of go,</v>

225
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.860
<v Speaker 1>you let your imagination and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve dictate everything.</v>

226
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And to be able to do that and still keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lights on,</v>

227
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a lucky bastard.</v>

228
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.390
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
