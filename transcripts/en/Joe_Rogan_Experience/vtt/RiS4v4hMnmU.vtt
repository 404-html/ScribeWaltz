00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very different than a regular movie.</v>

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>What did he start doing these cereal?</v>

5
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I think of like game of Thrones is a serial movie,</v>

7
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a hundred parts to this movie,</v>

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big giant ass movie.</v>

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

11
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

12
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>it's so much better than a regular television show in terms of like it's special</v>

13
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>effects and the grandness of it all.</v>

14
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>If they can figure out how to film something like that,</v>

15
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but let you participate in it.</v>

16
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you strap on to some three d treadmill type thing and move around in</v>

18
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>this fucking weird world and follow these people on their journeys.</v>

19
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Be Right there when the ORC slaughter the people like God,</v>

20
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>like the blood splatter in front of you and you're watching them get chopped up</v>

21
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to go over the mountain to where the castle is.</v>

22
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to actually walk over the mountain,</v>

23
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>but as you walk over the mountain,</v>

24
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>horses ride beside you,</v>

25
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you get to see them.</v>

26
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.863
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we're real close to something like that.</v>

28
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's only a few years away.</v>

29
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Avatar world coming out soon.</v>

30
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Like in Disney at Disney.</v>

31
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Disney world.</v>

32
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

33
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.943
<v Speaker 2>what are I going to do?</v>

34
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>How's that going to work?</v>

35
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

36
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>they've been showing some things like this is,</v>

37
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I think this is just a imagineering whoa idea,</v>

38
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>but this like you're gonna be able to take a boat ride through the middle of the</v>

39
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Navi forest.</v>

40
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

41
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:30.831
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

42
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Well that sounds like it's a small world.</v>

43
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lower step,</v>

44
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to have some VR stuff you're gonna be able to float through</v>

45
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and go on the,</v>

46
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

47
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's how they are looking to Disney world right now.</v>

48
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

49
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.011
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>

50
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 2>they're building it right now,</v>

51
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 2>but you're obviously not to be able to walk on that.</v>

52
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 2>When is this going to take place?</v>

53
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it opens this later this year.</v>

54
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland does next years.</v>

55
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.503
<v Speaker 2>But what you're saying,</v>

56
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 2>what if they just took the extension of that and just instead of like making the</v>

57
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.371
<v Speaker 2>avatar movie,</v>

58
00:01:58.371 --> 00:01:58.911
<v Speaker 2>they just went,</v>

59
00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:59.121
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

60
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Avatar five is avatar world and if you want to come live it out,</v>

61
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 2>you've got to come to Disney world and pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks or 150 bucks,</v>

62
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.313
<v Speaker 2>300 bucks,</v>

63
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 2>something crazy to do it.</v>

64
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking.</v>

65
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.481
<v Speaker 1>That would be all,</v>

66
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:13.271
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do.</v>

67
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 1>You construct that world.</v>

68
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And then once you're in that world,</v>

69
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>then you put on the VR goggles and it turns everything into fluorescent neon</v>

70
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Greens and Blues and like the Avatar world.</v>

71
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>You could see everything and then you actually watched the movie play out in</v>

72
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

73
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

74
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a nerd gas me.</v>

75
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.413
<v Speaker 1>I feel like</v>

76
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 2>closer to something like that then.</v>

77
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Well we are everyone being able to do with this probably span.</v>

78
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing about that though is it's going to require so much resources and</v>

79
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 2>land and money and that doesn't change,</v>

80
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

81
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 2>But we have these notions of fairness play out in different ways as we're</v>

82
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

83
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>but different political groups and different tribes favor these other notions of</v>

84
00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 2>fairness more than some others.</v>

85
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So take for example,</v>

86
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 2>the issue of pro life versus pro choice.</v>

87
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

88
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.551
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>So you have,</v>

90
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 2>let's just,</v>

91
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 2>here's the question.</v>

92
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Are Liberals prolife or are liberals pro choice,</v>

93
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 2>they're more pro choice on the issue of abortion.</v>

94
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

95
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>So on abortion it's about freedom,</v>

96
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

97
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

98
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

99
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

100
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>it's very much about women's rights,</v>

101
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>women's freedom.</v>

102
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>

103
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.301
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

105
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not even thought of it like as a human freedom because,</v>

106
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

107
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

108
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it's about the woman,</v>

109
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 2>not about the child.</v>

110
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

111
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's about the woman's freedom,</v>

112
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

113
00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 2>So they've hooked up to that idea of freedom,</v>

114
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

115
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

116
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

117
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are pro life.</v>

119
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>This is about caring and protecting from harm and all that sort of stuff.</v>

120
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

121
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're talking about war,</v>

122
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 2>unless you're talking about war.</v>

123
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly the point is,</v>

124
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

125
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 2>are all humans hypocrites or is it that we selectively use these same intuitions</v>

127
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>that we all have for different causes?</v>

128
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.861
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at,</v>

129
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.341
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

130
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 2>gun control are liberals pro choice or pro life,</v>

131
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 2>they're definitely prolife.</v>

132
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Aha.</v>

133
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So what you see is that on abortion they're pro choice and on gun control</v>

134
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>they're pro life.</v>

135
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 2>But then when it comes the other way,</v>

136
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.234
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

137
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Publicans are pro choice when it comes to guns.</v>

138
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>So we all have the same intuitions,</v>

139
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but we use them in different ways to justify our political arguments.</v>

140
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

141
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting too is that there's two positions that are taking place in</v>

142
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>the American psyche,</v>

143
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:23.171
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>

144
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:28.171
<v Speaker 2>that were almost reluctantly agreeing to and is that the Republicans are,</v>

145
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>or the Conservatives are more realistic,</v>

146
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 2>more hardcore,</v>

147
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 2>ready to kick ass ready to fight for what's right.</v>

148
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Whereas liberals are bunch of whiny crybabies looking to give away their money</v>

149
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 2>and they creating welfare babies.</v>

150
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

151
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.840
<v Speaker 2>that certainly just if it wasn't for,</v>

152
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for the conservatives,</v>

153
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 2>these fucking people would be speaking German and living in Vietnam.</v>

154
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

155
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 2>all tribes,</v>

157
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the nature of tribes,</v>

158
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you tell something that makes your tribe look like the good guys,</v>

159
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

160
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.433
<v Speaker 2>That the sport,</v>

161
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 2>is it ever going to be clean?</v>

162
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's way cleaner now in the UFC that it's ever been before.</v>

163
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's also,</v>

164
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that one fcs available for guys who don't want to be clean.</v>

165
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:09.400

<v Speaker 2>We don't want to be clean.</v>

168
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.781
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument either way,</v>

170
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument for the pride way,</v>

171
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>which was everybody knew that everybody was on it.</v>

175
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 3>We're [inaudible].</v>

176
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.781

179
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:25.871

180
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:26.704
<v Speaker 3>I mean buddy,</v>

181
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 3>I did it cold or the boss store.</v>

182
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I was going backstage with the camera showing everybody,</v>

183
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:32.801
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

184
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.161
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

185
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Hey you,</v>

186
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 3>this is how you look at that.</v>

187
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's frighteningly training and you know what?</v>

188
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:36.311
<v Speaker 3>Then I say,</v>

189
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

190
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 3>we walk into the room from the doctors.</v>

191
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 3>So I opened the door and I looked at the side and I see all the pts there would</v>

192
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>hold little sticks on them,</v>

193
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

194
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 3>And I close the door right away and I look in the camera,</v>

195
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:46.631
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

196
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>give me one moment to the very busy,</v>

197
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 3>let me walk in and ask for permission.</v>

198
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:52.130
<v Speaker 3>So I walk in and I grab one of those cups and I,</v>

199
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:52.781
<v Speaker 3>she green tea,</v>

200
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 3>I fill it up and it put the same cup next to it.</v>

201
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 3>So then when you weren't even,</v>

202
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 3>you should open it allowed to that and be that close.</v>

203
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.190
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

204
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.381
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

205
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.931
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

208
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I could have got,</v>

209
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.411
<v Speaker 3>can contaminate it,</v>

210
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

211
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 3>So I'm walking in and I'm saying,</v>

212
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.821
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

213

<v Speaker 3>these are the doctors here.</v>

214
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:06.760
<v Speaker 3>And they looked at us and think,</v>

215
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh hey,</v>

216

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:09.724
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

219
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.860

220
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 3>and these people,</v>

221
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.580
<v Speaker 3>they looked at me as,</v>

222
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I take my green tea and I take the thing off.</v>

223
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.730
<v Speaker 3>And they go like,</v>

224

225
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:22.001
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

229
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.160
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

230
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Can I take a little sip?</v>

231
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

232
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

233

<v Speaker 1>not water.</v>

238
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's all at the end of the day,</v>

239
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:43.690
<v Speaker 1>a manifestation of probably some shit you haven't worked out,</v>

240
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>which is still a feeling of insecurity.</v>

241
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Still a hole you can't fill.</v>

242
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
