<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I used to make it taste good,</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but now I don't even make the gel shake</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste good anymore.</v>

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to slam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just tastes terrible because I'd give</v>

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>a giant chunks of ginger and garlic now</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll have like a,</v>

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>like seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember what pagers used to look like?</v>

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>A chunk of ginger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking camera shake.</v>

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Put in one shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You slammed that Ninja turtles have</v>

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>about half of that in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shake.</v>

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I slam it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slam it in four or five cloves of</v>

12
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smells so bad afterwards.</v>

13
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Smelling like garlic can take for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>good jokes man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smell</v>

15
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>like garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just train you.</v>

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>just ate some garlic loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Become horrible.</v>

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time you're in the</v>

20
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>tests and mood to make a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>to youtube hits off of that.</v>

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>All you'd have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just I would come on the desk and</v>

22
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>just dip your finger and go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you would have to do.</v>

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>It's over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the you youtube would break.</v>

24
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've got the curdled kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could just pick up.</v>

25
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my login.</v>

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Very normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertile time.</v>

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>This shit took a lot of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

28
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.763
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

29
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My loads of quite fluid taste like</v>

30
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>garlic and this is back at the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male crew right here.</v>

31
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if dudes or chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas women have a certain amount of</v>

32
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>eggs and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

33
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if dudes were like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a certain amount of loads.</v>

34
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>You're like checking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pulled your balls up the sun to see</v>

35
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>like where your load line is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that have to do.</v>

36
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would have blue balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

37
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>The next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

38
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Girls would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

39
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>give me some low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not worth it.</v>

40
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.193
<v Speaker 1>You're not worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

41
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Should become until like a gambling</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational thing.</v>

42
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Guys would go in and they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tantric where you squeeze it down to</v>

43
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that was the tip of your Dick and</v>

44
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>like a lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that was a case that was the</v>

45
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys would have more power and getting</v>

46
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

47
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>On the girls side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 1>like it's easy for easier for a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a whole lot easier for a guy if</v>

49
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>you had so many innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we all fucking band together,</v>

50
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>we can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

51
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's to start this right now with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

52
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Podcast is powerful to have a Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

53
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Take back your loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save him.</v>

54
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not valued right now in the equation,</v>

55
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be stopped wasting them.</v>

56
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a key ingredient and making people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

57
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Without the loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got nothing.</v>

58
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem though is that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like starting a fighters' union.</v>

59
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not really going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>but just dude's like fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what dudes would say when it</v>

61
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>comes to the Deq Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we all got together and said,</v>

62
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>

63
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to make our dicks more valuable.</v>

64
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to make it harder to get to.</v>

65
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Let's work something out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys.</v>

66
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>The first ones are going to sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 2>big time and the ones that are starting</v>

67
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 2>this thing because now they're the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones not getting laid.</v>

68
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.810
<v Speaker 2>You just start this whole trend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>same as with the fighter union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only one not getting paid.</v>

70
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is really tough.</v>

71
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to say,</v>

72
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voters are lazy or whatever they</v>

73
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but honestly,</v>

74
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got real lives to live and I</v>

75
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 2>haven't got time for all this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a really big part of why we want</v>

76
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>to make it simple.</v>

77
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're assuming that people want to spend</v>

78
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 2>less time doing this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not more time and I think a lot of the</v>

79
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

80
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>organizations and people that have tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get people mobilized,</v>

81
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civic organization and the kind of</v>

82
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.251
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worked to a certain extent with</v>

84
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the majority of people they just</v>

85
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't do it actually.</v>

86
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 2>There literally too busy with things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are higher priorities,</v>

87
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>like their kids and their family and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their job or whatever it may be.</v>

88
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Hobbies doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stuff that they choose to do and</v>

89
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's their life and we shouldn't kind</v>

90
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:27.241
<v Speaker 2>of require that you have to spend ages</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out this political stuff and</v>

91
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 2>that's why we're trying to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really simple for people,</v>

92
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 2>but based on quite a lot of compost and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what technology allows you to do.</v>

93
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 2>You can take quite a lot of complex data</v>
<v Speaker 2>and information like we're doing with</v>

94
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 2>the campaign finance records where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally hundreds of millions of pieces</v>

95
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
<v Speaker 2>of information and we're boiling it down</v>
<v Speaker 2>into one piece of information which is a</v>

96
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>score like where is this candidate on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

97
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 2>On the scale of liberal to conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do they sit and where are they on</v>

98
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 2>each issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're trying to do to make</v>

99
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 2>it really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it sort of analogous in a way to</v>

100
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 2>what we were talking about about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people that you can keep in</v>

101
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunbar's number is that if you lived in</v>

102
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>a small tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if safe,</v>

103
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 2>we all live 50 of us together in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>small village somewhere.</v>

104
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.480
<v Speaker 2>We really wouldn't have votes about gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage and we really wouldn't have</v>

105
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>coats about could be a million different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that would never be up for vote</v>

106
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 2>and if someone really did start micro</v>
<v Speaker 2>managing everyone's lives,</v>

107
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you'd be.</v>

108
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

109
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike is an asshole.</v>

110
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>We got to kick him out of his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe.</v>

111
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.190
<v Speaker 2>This guy's trying to get people to wear</v>
<v Speaker 2>purple and you know,</v>

112
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>where certain Nike's during different</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon cycles and make tribal rules and</v>

113
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>rituals and make all these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>standard and you know,</v>

114
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason he doesn't like men</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping with men.</v>

115
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Like he's got some weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

116
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 2>he believes it's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just so agree with that.</v>

117
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.760
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite things that I'm one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these experiments that was in</v>

118
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got that right in in,</v>

119
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.090
<v Speaker 2>in Europe and they did this brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment with traffic where they are</v>

120
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>in a town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was friesland or something</v>

121
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably got that wrong where they</v>

122
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 2>literally took away all the traffic</v>
<v Speaker 2>signals,</v>

123
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 2>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

124
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took away traffic lights.</v>

125
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>They even took you stop signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

126
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the markings on the road.</v>

127
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 2>So they took away the white line in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the road,</v>

128
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.881
<v Speaker 2>everything all gone and their theory was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that without that kind of external rule</v>

129
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 2>making and kind of stuff going on to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you what to do,</v>

130
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 2>people would have to kind of relate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other as other people and just</v>

131
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 2>figure it out amongst themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would,</v>

132
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 2>have to look other people in the eye and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of work it out between them.</v>

134
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>And they found they had this brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>

135
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 2>which was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

136
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 2>accidents felt a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The traffic improve,</v>

137
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 2>the traffic speed was lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the traffic flow was much better.</v>

138
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>It just worked all around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the kinds of things that you try and</v>

139
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>do when all these people thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic planning and whatever.</v>

140
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>They achieved those aims by literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking everything away and just allowing</v>

141
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>people to relate to each other as</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

142
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 2>And was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was such a great little</v>

143
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 2>story and I think that you could do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all sorts of areas.</v>

144
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>If you just leave it to people to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out on a small scale where they can</v>

145
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>relate to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get a much better result.</v>
