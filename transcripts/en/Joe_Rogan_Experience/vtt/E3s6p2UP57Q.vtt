00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>one Yamaha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And realize my good friend Doug Dorin.</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Hello Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Joe Rogan,</v>

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>who to see or so away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.524
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Brian Richards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend,</v>

8
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>a wildlife biologist and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to talk about a bunch</v>

9
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I wanted to</v>

10
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>talk about is this scary disease that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>well when Ted nugent was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>he downplayed the consequences and</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of something called cwd or</v>

13
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>chronic wasting disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has made it onto your farm and you</v>

14
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>live in Wisconsin and you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful place that we visited when we</v>

15
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>did the immediate or television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a new thing that this</v>

16
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>chronic wasting disease was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

17
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it decimates the deer's health and kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And the suspicion is that some of us at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least comes from these high fence</v>

19
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>operations where people grow dear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and treat them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like a wild animal,</v>

21
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>they treat them like a domesticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and have them all feeding off of</v>

22
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>the same pile of food and they share</v>
<v Speaker 1>this disease.</v>

23
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Is this all correct and accurate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian</v>

24
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just started out about an hour's</v>

25
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 2>worth of congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit.</v>

27
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a wildlife biologist with the</v>

28
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 2>national wildlife health center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>US geological survey up in Madison,</v>

29
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

30
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I spend a lot of</v>

31
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>time on is chronic wasting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that makes me necessarily</v>

32
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 2>an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've gotten to know a lot of people</v>

33
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that I would call experts over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

34
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So I've gained a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your,</v>

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.710
<v Speaker 2>your statement there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could start a number of different</v>

37
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:48.544
<v Speaker 2>places</v>

38
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>describe what it does do these animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why it's such a major concern.</v>

41
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't jumped to humans yet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're aware that we're aware of,</v>

42
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but it is a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very real possibility.</v>

43
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 2>We can't rule it out at this point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

44
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Science is unable to rule it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

45
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great place to start.</v>

46
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Why would we care about this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>called chronic wasting disease?</v>

47
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 2>And I would argue in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some other scientists have argued</v>

48
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>there's two major reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one is the impacts of this</v>

49
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>disease on members of the deer family</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

50
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 2>And the other is that we cannot rule out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that cwd could become a</v>

51
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>human health issue at some point down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

52
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of nailed those two with regard</v>

53
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 2>to deer or members of the deer family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whitetail deer,</v>

54
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 2>mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk,</v>

55
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most recently it was picked up in,</v>

56
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 2>in reindeer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Norway of all places.</v>

57
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

58
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 2>we could articulate some reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some rationale why this disease might be</v>

59
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 2>thought of as being important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First we look at is would be geographic</v>

60
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.304
<v Speaker 2>spread.</v>

61
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.811
<v Speaker 2>cwd 20 years ago was thought to be this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really novel thing in a very restricted</v>

63
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>geographic range in south eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming,</v>

64
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>adjacent North Eastern Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a little spill over and in</v>

65
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wildlife biologist,</v>

66
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>wildlife disease specialist looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this disease.</v>

67
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.780
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know much about it at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>

69
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed to be very isolated there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it do to the dear Kilz dare,</v>

70
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how does it kill him?</v>

71
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a member of a family of</v>

72
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.610
<v Speaker 2>diseases called transmissible spongiform</v>
<v Speaker 2>encephalopathy.</v>

73
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 2>These are tss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So big long words.</v>

74
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Transmissible means it can go from</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal aid.</v>

75
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Animal be spongiform means looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sponge and encephalopathy means disease</v>

76
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you put it together.</v>

77
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 2>And so this disease results in holes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain resulting in progressive</v>

78
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 2>neurological degeneration followed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

79
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

80
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a death sentence and there's no,</v>

81
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>or for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can capture the deer</v>

82
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and give them some sort of metal</v>

83
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>cation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No cure for these diseases.</v>

84
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 2>The sweeter diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

85
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a members of the TSC group of</v>

86
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>diseases in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most familiar is,</v>

87
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>is one called crites veiled Jacobes</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

88
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's very similar to mad cow disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same family.</v>

89
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Second one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the champions.</v>

90
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say [inaudible] you could say price,</v>

91
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just read it.</v>

92
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.684
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

94
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back and forth on whether it's pre</v>

95
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prion stand poisoner to receive the</v>

96
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Nobel laureate for his work on these</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>

97
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 2>coined the term to prion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in his first publication describing</v>

98
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>these diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did a phonetic spelling and it's</v>

99
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 2>prion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So other researchers,</v>

100
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.870
<v Speaker 2>it's especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some from across the pond,</v>

102
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it's gotta be prion.</v>

103
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And the main reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>some of them I've talked to about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that an ERC stand poizner when he</v>

105
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>hears it called Prion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

106
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Speaker 2>so we'll say Priyanka.</v>

107
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll say prion from now on this</v>

108
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people know as mad cow disease,</v>

109
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

110
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is transmissible to humans.</v>

111
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why people are</v>

112
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:17.400
<v Speaker 1>very scared that this could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump from deer into humans.</v>

113
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also is making its way into the</v>

114
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>actual plants that these animals eat.</v>

115
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 2>You're correct on both accounts show</v>
<v Speaker 2>with BSE,</v>

116
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 2>mad cow disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting disease where it</v>

117
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 2>resulted from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in essence,</v>

118
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>turning cows into cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

119
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>which all cyclists in New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right with KCC,</v>

120
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Coatesville with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with crew,</v>

121
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 2>which is a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

122
00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:47.621
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A tsc likely started when one individual</v>

123
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>developed Roitfeld Jacobes disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That individual died.</v>

124
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a practice was the practice in the,</v>

125
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>for a tribe in Papa New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

126
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>they practice ritualized cannibalism to</v>
<v Speaker 2>honor the dead and to help release the</v>

127
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 2>spirits from you now deceased family</v>
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>

128
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>So they would feed upon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

129
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 2>upon the corpse and port and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bodies of their deceased.</v>

130
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 2>So when one individual died of probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>some variant of Coatesville Jakob's</v>

131
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the causative agent,</v>

132
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 2>the prion protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is concentrated in the central</v>

133
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 2>nervous system and lymphatic systems of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 2>of disease patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was fed back to other members of</v>

135
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the family and the extended family.</v>

136
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And so when they got sick and died</v>
<v Speaker 2>veteran again,</v>

137
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.220
<v Speaker 2>so we saw that with brew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

138
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.063
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 abused in 1960 around there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

140
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 2>it was realized that this cannibalistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior was likely the result,</v>

141
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the right view,</v>

142
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 2>the cause of disease transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism was outlawed.</v>

143
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 2>And at that point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you broke completely the d disease</v>

144
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 2>transmission cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no more new cases of Kourou,</v>

145
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>but they had lingering cases with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>extended incubation period up to 40</v>

146
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 2>years later before Kourou finally burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that population.</v>

147
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>So now with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with BSC or mad cow disease,</v>

148
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 2>we were doing exactly in essence the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

149
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 2>not exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in essence.</v>

150
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.170
<v Speaker 2>So in an effort to maximize production</v>
<v Speaker 2>and reduce the amount of waste when they</v>

151
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:29.070
<v Speaker 2>butchered cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would take all the awful Oh ffa l you</v>

152
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 2>have the high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bones,</v>

153
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 2>the parts that are inedible and we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>had rendered them cook them at high</v>

154
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 2>temperature and typically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 2>high pressure as well.</v>

156
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 2>And it turns into a slurry high protein</v>
<v Speaker 2>slurry.</v>

157
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>You skim the fat off the top of that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then dehydrate the rest of it.</v>

158
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 2>kind of a meat and bone meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high protein supplement,</v>

160
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 2>realizing that cattle grow faster and</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce better when they're,</v>

161
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>when on a hyper higher protein diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed reasonable to use waste</v>

162
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>material from cows to feed back to cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at some point,</v>

163
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.113
<v Speaker 2>turning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning,</v>

164
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 2>turning thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the candles.</v>

165
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>So at some point in time a cow developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a TSC,</v>

166
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>a prion disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it came from scrapey,</v>

167
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 2>the tsc of sheep or arose on its own is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

168
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 2>But that cow died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was rendered into meat and bone meal</v>

169
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>and this high protein feed was then fed</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to hundreds to thousands.</v>

170
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.130
<v Speaker 2>And correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for these crayons,</v>

171
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>they could survive up to more than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand degree temperature.</v>

172
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surviving is kind of a,</v>

173
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 2>a strange term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe in,</v>

174
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 2>they're not alive to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a protein a,</v>

175
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 2>they can persist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot be inactivated.</v>

176
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to,</v>

177
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 2>he's to Cook Pretty Harley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These premiums are not necessarily the</v>

178
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 2>living thing like a disease or a virus</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a bacteria.</v>

179
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a disease causing agent,</v>

180
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but they are incredibly unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so,</v>

181
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:01.791
<v Speaker 2>they're an edl logic agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a virus or bacteria or a parasite</v>

182
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>could be causing disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all these other things have genetic</v>

183
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're alive,</v>

184
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 2>which allows them to change rapidly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve over time.</v>

185
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole concept that you have a</v>

186
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a protein that all mammals produce in a</v>

187
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.391
<v Speaker 2>normal form can be converted after</v>
<v Speaker 2>production into a disease associated</v>

188
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 2>form that has these radically different</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>

189
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 2>One that you mentioned was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>resistance to heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat treatment,</v>

191
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 2>a normal prion protein.</v>

192
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And we have billions of them circulating</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our bodies right now.</v>

193
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a specific purposes,</v>

194
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 2>cellular purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know exactly what it is,</v>

195
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's likely involved in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intracellular communication.</v>

196
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a string of around 250 amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so relatively short protein.</v>

197
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It does whatever it's does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the body recycles,</v>

198
00:09:55.771 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>breaks that chain of amino acids down</v>
<v Speaker 2>into its component parts and recycles</v>

199
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that normal.</v>

200
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>So we would preamp protein likely has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half life of maybe four to six hours.</v>

201
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're producing them relatively</v>

202
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:12.260
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the disease associated form</v>

203
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.390
<v Speaker 2>in all diseases associated prions start</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the normal cellular Priya.</v>

204
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>So they're converted from one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three dimensional form to a different</v>

205
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

206
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 2>And this different form has these</v>
<v Speaker 2>radically different characteristics.</v>

207
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 2>One is heat resistance and other is UV</v>
<v Speaker 2>light resistance.</v>

208
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned that the normal cellular</v>

209
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 2>prion protein has a half life of maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to six hours.</v>

210
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 2>The disease associated ones can persist</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the environment for years and</v>

211
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>potentially up to decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

212
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:43.824
<v Speaker 2>And when you say persistent,</v>

213
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 3>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean in like on the ground on</v>

214
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 3>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on like how would they be,</v>

215
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

216
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Just through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if a deer,</v>

217
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Moose sheds infectious agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this prion protein,</v>

218
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 2>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the time of deer is infected,</v>

219
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.330
<v Speaker 2>it's probably around two years before it</v>
<v Speaker 2>develops.</v>

220
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Clinical signs of disease goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll lose as it's fear,</v>

221
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>a human's dramatic weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

222
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.360
<v Speaker 2>all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that incubation period,</v>

223
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably shedding infectious agent</v>

224
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.570
<v Speaker 2>for the vast majority of that time</v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

225
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>So it looks healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's able of transmitting disease.</v>

226
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.710
<v Speaker 2>We'd call that Ala typhoid Mary Syndrome</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syndrome.</v>

227
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 3>The two deer that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

228
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.270
<v Speaker 3>that were positive on our farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two bucks,</v>

229
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.210
<v Speaker 3>two and a half year old bucks were we</v>
<v Speaker 3>had them tested.</v>

230
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:34.900
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

231
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.310
<v Speaker 3>for the last several years we've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

232
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>initially we got our,</v>

233
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only bucks tested and then the last</v>

234
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.770
<v Speaker 3>three or four years we've gotten all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer tested.</v>

235
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.020
<v Speaker 3>They were a two and a half year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>

236
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.730
<v Speaker 3>perfectly look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly healthy.</v>

237
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.210
<v Speaker 3>And these are the first ones that you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested that tested positive and we</v>

238
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.133
<v Speaker 3>tested</v>

239
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.250
<v Speaker 4>in excess of 35 deer over the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well more than happy,</v>

240
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 4>more than like 50 during the incubation</v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

241
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Would they still test positive at some</v>
<v Speaker 4>point?</v>

242
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 4>They will at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that could be spreading infectious</v>

243
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:07.980
<v Speaker 4>agents without testing positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

244
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's say it's probably between three</v>
<v Speaker 4>and six months out when we can test an</v>

245
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 4>animal test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's likely shedding infectious</v>

246
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 4>agent at least at lower quantities prior</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that point in time.</v>

247
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 4>And so then he said it's shedding</v>
<v Speaker 4>infectious agent.</v>

248
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 4>It's capable of transmitting disease and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cave long before it looks clinically</v>

249
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 4>ill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

250
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the real challenges with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this disease.</v>

251
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 4>From a management standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look perfectly healthy,</v>

252
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 4>they act perfectly healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're starting to have that</v>

253
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:46.981
<v Speaker 4>progressive neurological degeneration</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can only see very near the end</v>

254
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 4>of disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

255
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this seems like we could potentially</v>

256
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 4>be facing a ticking time bomb of many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

257
00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 4>many deer that are wandering around out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there right now that look totally</v>

258
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 4>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are spreading this stuff all over</v>

259
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 4>the place and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're acting normally look perfectly</v>

260
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.074
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

261
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 4>And then obviously with this multi year</v>
<v Speaker 4>incubation period,</v>

262
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 4>this kid just cascade and I think we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen evidence of that now.</v>

263
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>started at,</v>

264
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he talked about being isolated disease.</v>

265
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 4>It was picked up in Wisconsin at the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 2001 as of today,</v>

266
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 4>cwd has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now penn picked up in 25 states in</v>

267
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 4>captive and or free ranging populations</v>
<v Speaker 4>in whitetail deer,</v>

268
00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 4>mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk or Moose,</v>

269
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.610
<v Speaker 4>two Canadian provinces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

270
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 4>in addition to two is picked up in South</v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea.</v>

271
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 4>And that was real interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in captive elk and those elk</v>

272
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:47.731
<v Speaker 4>still had Canadian ear tags in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we pretty much know how cwd those</v>

273
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:53.251
<v Speaker 4>Elkton swim across the Pacific pond.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most recently it was picked up two years</v>

274
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:59.131
<v Speaker 4>ago in free ranging reindeer in Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And subsequent to that,</v>

275
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 4>it was picked up in a small handful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like three or four moose and a red deer</v>

276
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 4>in Norway in a single moose in Finland.</v>

277
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a real concern over in Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

278
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>with reindeer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

279
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:17.420
<v Speaker 4>So reindeer are very gregarious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

280
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 4>whitetail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

281
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Caribou,</v>

282
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 4>reindeer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not unusual to see him in herds of</v>

283
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So very,</v>

284
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 4>very different than what we see with</v>
<v Speaker 4>whitetail deer,</v>

285
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.640
<v Speaker 4>mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk,</v>

286
00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:32.880
<v Speaker 4>or Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't see those huge hurts.</v>

287
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 4>Met with elk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can in the wintertime.</v>

288
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's thought that this gregarious</v>

289
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 4>behavior might really facilitate</v>
<v Speaker 4>transmission in reindeer.</v>

290
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it was picked up in reindeer,</v>

291
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 4>nor we said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

292
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 4>we maybe should do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting story.</v>

293
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:50.700
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

294
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 4>Norway has got experience with scrapey</v>
<v Speaker 4>in sheep and so they have a long</v>

295
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is scrappy?</v>

296
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Scrappy is the same as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same family diseases and sheep.</v>

297
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the first one that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>described scrapey we've known about</v>

298
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 4>since the early 17 hundreds a disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a domestic sheep,</v>

299
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 4>and it's called scrapey because of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior of these animals,</v>

300
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 4>once they enter the clinical phase of</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease display and they,</v>

301
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 4>they seem like they itch bat.</v>

302
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 4>And so they'll go up to fence posts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>other objects and they will literally</v>

303
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 4>rub their hide off of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the name scraping.</v>

304
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 4>And it's the same progressive</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurological disorder followed by death.</v>

305
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 4>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as this disease creates vacuums in</v>

306
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's killing off neurons.</v>

307
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 4>And so without those neurons firing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fall into that progressive</v>

308
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 4>degeneration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet at some point your body can no</v>

309
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 4>longer survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's really spooky about</v>

310
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 4>how this thing kills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

311
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 4>go back to Norway when they detected</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwt.</v>

312
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 4>Trying to keep this a little bit closer</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>

313
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.860
<v Speaker 4>You're very soft spoken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no worries.</v>

314
00:15:56.861 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hear myself.</v>

315
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Plenty of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that recording?</v>

316
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.103
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

317
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 4>no worries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when they picked up cwd and reindeer</v>

318
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:09.851
<v Speaker 4>in Norway and the researchers over there</v>
<v Speaker 4>had witnessed what we are lack of</v>

319
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:14.480
<v Speaker 4>success on this side of the pond over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the course of the last 20 years,</v>

320
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 4>they took it very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very seriously.</v>

321
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they took kind of some harsh</v>

322
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:20.470
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

323
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 4>they announced their plans that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to eliminate a herd unit.</v>

324
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:29.420
<v Speaker 4>They were going to kill every rain deer</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an entire herd unit in Norway.</v>

325
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>The idea is to eliminate the host</v>
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

326
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 4>It's called stamping out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it works in a pen.</v>

327
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 4>This is the first time had been done</v>
<v Speaker 4>realistically in a free ranging</v>

328
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:41.390
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

329
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have effective tools for</v>

330
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 4>management as disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were very fearful of what would</v>

331
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 4>happen if this spread throughout that</v>
<v Speaker 4>reindeer population and throughout other</v>

332
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 4>reindeer herds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like Alaska,</v>

333
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:57.750
<v Speaker 4>they have multiple herds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like last year I hunted Caribou with,</v>

334
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.930
<v Speaker 4>with Steve up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

335
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40 mile river area,</v>

336
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 4>but there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they're very,</v>

337
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll localize.</v>

338
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:07.280
<v Speaker 4>This is probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least they have a range that they</v>

339
00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:07.850
<v Speaker 4>move through.</v>

340
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then in Norway they have two or</v>

341
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 4>three different herds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many more than that.</v>

342
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.190
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know exactly how many heard</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could isolate of the herd.</v>

343
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.590
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is before this gets to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>any worse before it gets any farther,</v>

344
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 4>let's take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had a hunting season,</v>

345
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 4>they allowed a hunter's to take as many</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they could,</v>

346
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 4>which was a little over a thousand range</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

347
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 4>And then they came in with government</v>
<v Speaker 4>agents.</v>

348
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 4>But it's sharp concern that the hunters</v>
<v Speaker 4>could eat something with cwd and then</v>

349
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 4>catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's always a concern.</v>

350
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 4>But what we can talk about human health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me finish this one up though,</v>

351
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 4>with Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it took,</v>

352
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 4>literally took the bull by the horns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They decided to do what was very</v>

353
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 4>unpopular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we have not been able to do in</v>

354
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 4>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

355
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 4>and so after the hunting season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>government agent sharpshooters took an</v>

356
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 4>additional 1400 reindeer as they killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>every reindeer in this herd unit and</v>

357
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 4>they're going to keep it foul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allow no reindeer in there for a minimum</v>

358
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 4>of five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it says every bit of promise of being</v>

359
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 4>the first large scale success with</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with this disease in a free</v>

360
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 4>ranging heard pretty different than what</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been able to accomplish over here</v>

361
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 4>five years.</v>

362
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

363
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.150
<v Speaker 3>with it being in the soil and dirt from</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was reading,</v>

364
00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:28.370
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't everything else is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

365
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.180
<v Speaker 3>so at some point there becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

366
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diminishing population or they die out</v>

367
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.320
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the proper word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not living so they don't</v>

368
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:41.630
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I become viable anymore,</v>

369
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five years is probably a pretty good,</v>

370
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a guesstimate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

371
00:18:45.451 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 4>As well with regard to how long these</v>
<v Speaker 4>prions remain viable in the,</v>

372
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 4>in the environment and in the substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>

373
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a good first guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what,</v>

374
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.380
<v Speaker 4>what they'll do then is slowly allowed</v>
<v Speaker 4>reindeer to repopulate.</v>

375
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 4>And as they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll be harvested periodically and</v>

376
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 4>every one of those will be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

377
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean it will be a long term experiment</v>
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>

378
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful management and also learned</v>

379
00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit about whether how far along</v>
<v Speaker 4>the environment was contaminated.</v>

380
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 4>So those thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they caught this disease very early.</v>

381
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 4>So after killing off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

382
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 4>2,400 reindeer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they had around 20 positives.</v>

383
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.020
<v Speaker 4>So very low prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suggesting the disease was very,</v>

384
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 4>very new in this system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to be successful with a</v>

385
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 4>disease where animals are shedding</v>
<v Speaker 4>infectious agent out into the</v>

386
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it persist for years to decades.</v>

387
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.650
<v Speaker 4>Do it early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're gunna get on it,</v>

388
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 4>get detected early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get on it fast,</v>

389
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 4>get on at heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why the decision to let human beings</v>

390
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 4>consumed them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well at this point in time that we</v>

391
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 4>really don't have any evidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that humans can get cwd could that</v>

392
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 4>potentially though be an incubation</v>
<v Speaker 4>period issue?</v>

393
00:19:53.221 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Just like it is with deer may be</v>
<v Speaker 4>extended with humans.</v>

394
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 4>Cause you were talking about how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the correct pronunciation.</v>

395
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I was pronouncing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

396
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:01.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

397
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.130
<v Speaker 4>W or Jakub [inaudible] disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that has a long incubation period in</v>

398
00:20:09.331 --> 00:20:10.260
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct?</v>

399
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

400
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.070
<v Speaker 4>And mad cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>

401
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Extended incubation period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kourou could,</v>

402
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the cases,</v>

403
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 4>it looks like we're up maybe even to 40,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even 50 year incubation.</v>

404
00:20:20.911 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Prts individually,</v>

405
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about crew for me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I talked to this guy,</v>

406
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've learned a lot from him about</v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of things and diseases.</v>

407
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:31.704
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

408
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 3>yesterday we were talking about Kourou</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

409
00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that was interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me about it is that these tribes,</v>

410
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 3>the women and children contracted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

411
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that interesting?</v>

412
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why was the man ate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>meat and the women</v>

413
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 4>and children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

414
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:53.750
<v Speaker 4>the internal organs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the internal organs as well as</v>

415
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.830
<v Speaker 4>concentrated as coolaroo took off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the features as the</v>

416
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 4>researchers in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

417
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 4>in the 50s and in 1950s we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the population.</v>

418
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few adult males had Kourou and it</v>

419
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 4>was more focused in the females and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

420
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 4>And so it came back to that ritualistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll cannibalism and he hit it right</v>

421
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 4>on the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

422
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 4>the women and children got to internal</v>
<v Speaker 4>organs,</v>

423
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 4>including the brain that have the</v>
<v Speaker 4>highest concentration of the,</v>

424
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 4>of the prion protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the man,</v>

425
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 4>if they consumed anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consumed the finer cuts of meat,</v>

426
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 4>which have a lower concentration but not</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

427
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just one of those social things</v>

428
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.360
<v Speaker 4>that just kind of stuck with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

429
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.650
<v Speaker 4>it is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty,</v>

430
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 4>pretty interesting story.</v>

431
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people reached out and some,</v>

432
00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.960
<v Speaker 1>some were very angry after Ted nugent</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the podcast.</v>

433
00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:49.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

434
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how cwd got brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

435
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the context was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

436
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But I remember him saying that winter</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills more animals than cwd does.</v>

437
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people were very angry that this</v>

438
00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:05.850
<v Speaker 1>was a gross simplification of what could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a ticking time bomb.</v>

439
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I guess I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

440
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

441
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.650
<v Speaker 4>his other disease out there called</v>
<v Speaker 4>epizootic hemorrhagic disease,</v>

442
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.670
<v Speaker 4>he ahd and periodically you'll have</v>
<v Speaker 4>significant outbreaks of this disease.</v>

443
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.020
<v Speaker 4>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in northern latitudes where the disease</v>

444
00:22:24.021 --> 00:22:28.780
<v Speaker 4>is not been present has often you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>see dramatic mortality.</v>

445
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.550
<v Speaker 4>80 90% of our herd can be killed in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>single event,</v>

446
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 4>but a very distinction between these</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>

447
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ehd is spread by midges little black,</v>

448
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 4>no seams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

449
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 4>Sabbagh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually transmits,</v>

450
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 4>transmits the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the virus from Adelaide animal be here</v>

451
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 4>from the environment to animal a either</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

452
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.940
<v Speaker 4>So while you have these pretty dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>die offs,</v>

453
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 4>as soon as the weather changes after the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first frost,</v>

454
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:04.990
<v Speaker 4>the first hard frost kills off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>midges and within about two weeks,</v>

455
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:09.991
<v Speaker 4>the disease cycle is broken completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it has significant impacts on a</v>

456
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 4>localized level periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the disease cycle,</v>

457
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 4>there's a definite end to the disease</v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle and then it's no longer present.</v>

458
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Well then for that period of time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a period of time anywhere the virus</v>

459
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 4>may persist in the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once the transmission cycle is</v>

460
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 4>broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mortality he snob and isn't there,</v>

461
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically engineered food plots that</v>

462
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:37.520
<v Speaker 1>they're putting together now or</v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of seed that a inhibits</v>

463
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.970
<v Speaker 1>midge growth and inhibits the HD?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of that,</v>

464
00:23:40.971 --> 00:23:43.310
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's also some stuff</v>

465
00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that bolsters animal's</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune</v>

466
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>

467
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 4>they're supplementing some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

468
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 4>the food with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're using,</v>

469
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 4>but it bolsters the animal's immune</v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

470
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:58.380
<v Speaker 4>It makes them less susceptible to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And populations that had been histo just</v>

471
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.490
<v Speaker 4>are exposed to Ehd over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely develop a herd immunity to</v>

472
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as the HD transferable to humans,</v>

473
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>

474
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 4>not that we've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence that it is,</v>

475
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 4>this is a disease that deer and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

476
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also can get into livestock.</v>

477
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 4>So even if people get bitten by these</v>
<v Speaker 4>midges,</v>

478
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.790
<v Speaker 4>there's still no concern that we could</v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially get adhd.</v>

479
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So contrast that this disease ehd with a</v>

480
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 4>very definite end to the transmission</v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle.</v>

481
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 4>First Frost kills off the midges with</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd.</v>

482
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 4>There's no known ecological factor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which signals the end of the</v>

483
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 4>transmission cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's why we see prevalence or the</v>

484
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:44.000
<v Speaker 4>proportion of animals that are positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>in individual locations in individual</v>

485
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 4>hurts.</v>

486
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 4>It just keeps going up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

487
00:24:46.131 --> 00:24:48.330
<v Speaker 4>up in captive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

488
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 4>facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

489
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:52.370
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hall farm in Wisconsin where cewd</v>

490
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 4>was first detected in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

491
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:59.561
<v Speaker 4>the place was depopulated in 2006</v>
<v Speaker 4>prevalence was nearly 80%.</v>

492
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 4>So four out of five deer in that cap of</v>
<v Speaker 4>servant facility had it.</v>

493
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More recently we had a farm,</v>

494
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:12.401
<v Speaker 4>a deer farm in Iowa where in know</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease had gone undetected for some</v>

495
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:16.280
<v Speaker 4>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when the herd was depopulated again</v>

496
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 4>about 80% prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this was a big hurts.</v>

497
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 4>There were over 200 positives in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>single high fenced enclosure.</v>

498
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 4>And so winners not going to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It grows.</v>

499
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.160
<v Speaker 4>So no stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no known feature which stops the</v>

500
00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:35.810
<v Speaker 4>transmission cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you say that something like</v>

501
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.880
<v Speaker 4>ehd kills a lot of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

502
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:40.820
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With the disease transmission cycle</v>

503
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 4>stops with cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know anything that's not</v>

504
00:25:44.521 --> 00:25:45.354
<v Speaker 4>opposite.</v>

505
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.800
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ehd is more like the flu or you had it</v>

506
00:25:51.221 --> 00:25:52.510
<v Speaker 3>on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your farm esd?</v>

507
00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:53.344
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

508
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.240
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me rephrase that.</v>

509
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I not that I'm aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

510
00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:58.983
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

511
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.840
<v Speaker 3>so when I learned about Ehd and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

512
00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Speaker 3>comparative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

513
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.130
<v Speaker 3>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you chronic wasting diseases,</v>

514
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.130
<v Speaker 3>like none other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

515
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.023
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

516
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it develops within the herd,</v>

517
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.020
<v Speaker 3>as it develops within the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just continues to grow.</v>

518
00:26:17.021 --> 00:26:19.480
<v Speaker 3>So it'll start out as a very small</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

519
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some maps of how it developed or</v>

520
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:26.530
<v Speaker 3>how it spread in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the southwest Wisconsin and we're on</v>

521
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:28.510
<v Speaker 3>the front edge of it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

522
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's all correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>

523
00:26:31.571 --> 00:26:34.210
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like the way it develops</v>

524
00:26:34.211 --> 00:26:39.211
<v Speaker 3>within the deer taking that period of</v>
<v Speaker 3>time before it becomes a clinical and</v>

525
00:26:39.851 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 3>the deer dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost as if that's reflective</v>

526
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 4>of how it moves from the landscape and</v>
<v Speaker 4>moves very slowly.</v>

527
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.960
<v Speaker 4>But once it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>

528
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Now I have read about hunters eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat from some sort of disease,</v>

529
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 4>deer and getting sick and dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would that be?</v>

530
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Misreporting would have been possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

531
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say that.</v>

532
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:05.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the,</v>

533
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.080
<v Speaker 4>there there've been instances where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

534
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:14.150
<v Speaker 4>people that hunted deer later died of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>prion disease likely developed</v>

535
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Crutchfield,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the outcomes disease.</v>

536
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so was it the deer that gave it to</v>

537
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:22.381
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

538
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 4>there's no epidemiological evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>this occurs at this point in time.</v>

539
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 4>And we've hinted about some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human health issues.</v>

540
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:35.391
<v Speaker 4>So there's a few things we can look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>in areas where cwd is known to exist.</v>

541
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Do we see higher mortality rates from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ spelled Jacobes disease?</v>

542
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.060
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does he have a prion disease,</v>

543
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 4>have humans than we do elsewhere?</v>

544
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 4>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

545
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 4>So from an epidemiological standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that cwd has crossed</v>

546
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:56.181
<v Speaker 4>over that species barrier into humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we can take a look at a number of,</v>

547
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 4>of science experiments that have been</v>
<v Speaker 4>conducted and at least in,</v>

548
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 4>in some of these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in experimental models,</v>

549
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.700
<v Speaker 4>we have evidence that the cwd prion</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein can cause human normal prions to</v>

550
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 4>convert to a disease associated form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

551
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 4>But now these are models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

552
00:28:19.171 --> 00:28:22.440
<v Speaker 4>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not quite the same as pumping cwd</v>

553
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.800
<v Speaker 4>into the brain of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a human patient and seeing what's</v>

554
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 4>what developed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

555
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.630
<v Speaker 4>So the science suggests that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>small nonzero chance that cwd could</v>

556
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 4>become a human health issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also some of the more recent</v>

557
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 4>science that's been conducted suggest</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this barrier,</v>

558
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 4>we call it the species barrier and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it really is a very robust barrier.</v>

559
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240
<v Speaker 4>One would think that keeps CD wg cwd</v>
<v Speaker 4>from crossing into human hosts.</v>

560
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.770
<v Speaker 4>That barrier may not be as tough as we</v>
<v Speaker 4>think it is and that barrier may be</v>

561
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 4>changing over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that because one of the things we've</v>

562
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:06.780
<v Speaker 4>talked about before is that they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered different strains of cwd.</v>

563
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sure is.</v>

564
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes ma'am.</v>

565
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.640
<v Speaker 4>It gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>

566
00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:17.210
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to get to that point.</v>

567
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely fascinating,</v>

568
00:29:19.621 --> 00:29:21.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's scaring the shit out of me</v>
<v Speaker 4>already.</v>

569
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is strange.</v>

570
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting with scraping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned that disease a sheep,</v>

571
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:31.851
<v Speaker 4>we recognize some 30 different strains</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's still all that same identical</v>

572
00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:37.110
<v Speaker 4>strand of amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's shaped that tertiary form must</v>

573
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 4>be slightly different and it manifests</v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly differently and sheep.</v>

574
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

575
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:48.450
<v Speaker 4>now with cwd there's at least two are</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognized strains that have been</v>

576
00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 4>published in peer reviewed literature.</v>

577
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 4>There's probably more strains out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

578
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of interesting.</v>

579
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a paper done a couple years</v>

580
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 4>ago which looked at the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the architecture of this disease</v>

581
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 4>associated prion protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>

582
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a portion of it that's referred</v>
<v Speaker 4>to as a loop structure and it's just</v>

583
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:09.581
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

584
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 4>if you take a rubber band and or a piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>of yarn or something and ball it up into</v>

585
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:16.600
<v Speaker 4>a three dimensional shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little loop hanging off the</v>

586
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:21.601
<v Speaker 4>side of this disease associated prion</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein and in deer and cwd,</v>

587
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.660
<v Speaker 4>that loop is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rigid.</v>

588
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very inflexible,</v>

589
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.710
<v Speaker 4>shall we say in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is more of a flexible loop as opposed</v>

590
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:38.890
<v Speaker 4>to the rigid loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's thought that this difference in</v>

591
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 4>that architecture is part is partially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

592
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:45.470
<v Speaker 4>controls that species barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

593
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.160
<v Speaker 4>So I was telling Doug that paper</v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>

594
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.483
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool.</v>

595
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty neat stuff actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was right zone.</v>

596
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.760
<v Speaker 4>So now it turns out mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experimental laboratory mice,</v>

597
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.830
<v Speaker 4>they're prion protein has the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>structure as the human pre Honda's.</v>

598
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you cannot give cwd to a normal</v>

599
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 4>laboratory mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just don't get it.</v>

600
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.650
<v Speaker 4>And it's likely this different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of this difference in their prion</v>

601
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one cannot convert that one to a</v>

602
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:20.440
<v Speaker 4>different form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So some researchers in Alberta,</v>

603
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>identified a strain of cwd which came</v>

604
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 4>from wild deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not something they engineered in</v>

605
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 4>the laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a strain from wild deer that</v>

606
00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.630
<v Speaker 4>does give mice cwd fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So most of the strains out there,</v>

607
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.270
<v Speaker 4>mice can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they discovered one that mice do</v>

608
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So researchers from a few years ago,</v>

609
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:47.560
<v Speaker 4>and lately I've seen it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the popular media that hey,</v>

610
00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 4>this difference in this loop structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to keep people from getting</v>

611
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 4>cwd.</v>

612
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.861
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

613
00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the assumptions that people can't</v>

614
00:31:56.561 --> 00:32:01.561
<v Speaker 4>get cwd are based that on this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwt is cwd and it will always be exactly</v>

615
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But our experience with scrapey strongly</v>

616
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:09.660
<v Speaker 4>suggests that even though there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

617
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 4>there's no dna in these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they do change over time.</v>

618
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 4>They morph over time into slightly</v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

619
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease characteristics and etiologic</v>

620
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.290
<v Speaker 4>agents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

621
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.160
<v Speaker 4>in the hunting community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there skepticism about this as Ted</v>

622
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 4>nugent's ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are these unique or is this a common</v>

623
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 4>thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is it a convenient thought for them</v>

624
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:34.730
<v Speaker 4>because they don't want it to be real?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

625
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 4>it's a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

626
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 4>of education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

627
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Mostly</v>

628
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.090
<v Speaker 3>just in whatever period of time that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked here and it's,</v>

629
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really complicated in it it,</v>

630
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.850
<v Speaker 3>and to get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you almost want to stick your head in</v>

631
00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:52.030
<v Speaker 3>the sand and just forget about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

632
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 3>besides of the sort of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

633
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 3>your friend that we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>before that like I was doing on the farm</v>

634
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

635
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.760
<v Speaker 3>managing deer in a particular way for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular kind of deer,</v>

636
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which might be contrary to the,</v>

637
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.370
<v Speaker 3>to the spread of the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

638
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.520
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to hear that I can't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I want it</v>

639
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.830
<v Speaker 4>do management.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about management wise and</v>

640
00:33:11.831 --> 00:33:13.390
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about my friend John</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dudley's,</v>

641
00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:18.391
<v Speaker 4>a farm in Iowa is that he only shoots</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big mature males and he lets all the</v>

642
00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:23.800
<v Speaker 4>other deal grow to a very large size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he has a really healthy population of</v>

643
00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:27.910
<v Speaker 4>big deer on his farm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what are you doing in your place?</v>

644
00:33:27.911 --> 00:33:30.460
<v Speaker 4>I understand you're just on a mass call.</v>

645
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm on the front edge of,</v>

646
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I am on the front end</v>

647
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:40.940
<v Speaker 3>of the spread of this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some in Wisconsin and</v>

648
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>southwest Wisconsin.</v>

649
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>So 15 years ago when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

650
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.630
<v Speaker 3>or 16 years ago when cwd was discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a lot of changes in,</v>

651
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.513
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

652
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 3>hunting structure and there was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>effort by the Department of natural</v>

653
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:59.170
<v Speaker 3>resources to eradicate the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

654
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.290
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

655
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.750
<v Speaker 3>the core area south of the Wisconsin</v>
<v Speaker 3>River,</v>

656
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.190
<v Speaker 3>about 70 miles from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

657
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 3>in 15 years the disease has moved 70</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles north.</v>

658
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that effort that the dnr started was,</v>

659
00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became political.</v>

660
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

661
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

662
00:34:17.311 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 3>and quite honestly that many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

663
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 3>I would have likely been a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptic.</v>

664
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I would have been skeptical.</v>

665
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 3>You want me to do what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to kill all the deer in a</v>

666
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:30.530
<v Speaker 3>particular area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

667
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 3>that many years ago had they come to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>farm and said,</v>

668
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 3>we're going to kill all the deer here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the near the neighboring dear,</v>

669
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 3>I would have had some real hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

670
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how I would react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I continued to do like buck management</v>

671
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:44.900
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there when we were still doing</v>

672
00:34:44.901 --> 00:34:46.160
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

673
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>

674
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

675
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how bucks contribute to the spread of</v>

676
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:56.390
<v Speaker 3>the disease and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that sort of thing.</v>

677
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Uniquely versus doe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

678
00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 4>we see different prevalence or curves</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on the demographic faction of</v>

679
00:35:07.861 --> 00:35:09.840
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adult males,</v>

680
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.510
<v Speaker 4>the ones with the big hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

681
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.860
<v Speaker 4>but gears on the law over there tend to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have higher prevalence sometimes,</v>

682
00:35:16.861 --> 00:35:17.820
<v Speaker 4>maybe two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

683
00:35:17.821 --> 00:35:21.660
<v Speaker 4>four times as high as other segments of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the population.</v>

684
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.220
<v Speaker 4>So highest prevalence and adult males</v>
<v Speaker 4>followed by adult females and then by</v>

685
00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:28.080
<v Speaker 4>juvenile animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

686
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's likely behavioral reasons why we</v>

687
00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:36.570
<v Speaker 4>see that in adult males.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So adult male deer,</v>

688
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the Rut or</v>

689
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 2>breeding season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they greatly expand their home range.</v>

690
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:44.250
<v Speaker 2>They contact multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a female or a family,</v>

691
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 2>groups of females earlier in the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with the white tail deer,</v>

692
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 2>adult males tend to gather in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>bachelor groups.</v>

693
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of social contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm grooming,</v>

694
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of their behavior,</v>

695
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.990
<v Speaker 2>they contact more animals at different</v>
<v Speaker 2>times of the year.</v>

696
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>And this number of contacts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's believed it's likely responsible</v>

697
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

698
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.710
<v Speaker 2>becoming infected at a higher rate than</v>
<v Speaker 2>other members out in the herd.</v>

699
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 2>So now if you are an adult male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're in the,</v>

700
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>in this group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have a higher likelihood of</v>

701
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 2>being able to transmit disease to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals because you're out there during</v>

702
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:22.880
<v Speaker 2>breeding season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

703
00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Is there any evidence that w that any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these deer have transferred this to</v>

704
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:31.340
<v Speaker 1>livestock or that it's God into</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>

705
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the food sources to corn and what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that could,</v>

706
00:36:34.011 --> 00:36:35.800
<v Speaker 1>could be consumed by people even that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are veggies.</v>

707
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting questions.</v>

708
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:41.760
<v Speaker 2>So with regard to transmission into</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle,</v>

709
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it's basically the same situation as</v>
<v Speaker 2>with humans.</v>

710
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 2>No evidence that it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in an experimental sense we can push</v>

711
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.710
<v Speaker 2>it over that species bear here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

712
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting you bring up plants because</v>

713
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>we have shown a research that we've done</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the National Wildlife Health Center</v>

714
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.910
<v Speaker 2>has shown that if you grow some plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>types in a slurry,</v>

715
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I concentrate a prion protein that those</v>
<v Speaker 2>odds can be uptaken through the roots</v>

716
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.550
<v Speaker 2>and deposited into stems and leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

717
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's one possible mechanism.</v>

718
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:24.410
<v Speaker 2>A second is that Cypriots himselves a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease associated pre hands tend to</v>

719
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 2>form very tight chemical bonds with</v>
<v Speaker 2>various surfaces.</v>

720
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Like showed him a paper on the way out</v>
<v Speaker 2>here yesterday where they bind to just</v>

721
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:34.860
<v Speaker 2>about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bind the plants as well.</v>

722
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So that deer that's out there with cwd</v>
<v Speaker 2>positives,</v>

723
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:40.860
<v Speaker 2>shedding infectious agent out into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

724
00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 2>through its urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through its saliva,</v>

725
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 2>through its feces.</v>

726
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.690
<v Speaker 2>So if a deer urinates as dear cwd</v>
<v Speaker 2>urinates on plants,</v>

727
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.200
<v Speaker 2>the prions have a tendency to bind to</v>
<v Speaker 2>those plants form a chemical bond.</v>

728
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not just drying on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forms a chemical bond to the plants</v>

729
00:37:57.991 --> 00:37:59.970
<v Speaker 2>and literally become part of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

730
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

731
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So a deer could eat those plants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be one of the possible</v>

732
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 2>transmission mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a second one.</v>

733
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.260
<v Speaker 2>The third one has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we speculated about and some folks</v>

734
00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>who've looked at in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it has potential impacts for,</v>

735
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agricultural commodities.</v>

736
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 2>So when cdot video was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:26.070
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago was really,</v>

738
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:28.380
<v Speaker 2>really rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably couldn't happen.</v>

739
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 2>But now it's in 25 states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast geographic areas we have,</v>

740
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm just south of where he lives</v>

741
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 4>in adult males,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly 50% prevalence.</v>

742
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 4>So when you kill that big buck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a coin out of your pocket,</v>

743
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 4>flip it in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's odds at that deer.</v>

744
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:46.960
<v Speaker 4>I cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he says just south,</v>

745
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 4>just 15 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

746
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 4>so now let's go out west.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

747
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

748
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 4>So let's go out to overall in the county</v>
<v Speaker 4>at this point,</v>

749
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.470
<v Speaker 4>let's go up into the big agricultural</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas in Saskatchewan or out west.</v>

750
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you got a mule deer herd out there.</v>

751
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:09.841
<v Speaker 4>We cwd and let's say maybe 20% overall</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that herd is cwd positives.</v>

752
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.800
<v Speaker 4>You've been out in some of those big</v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat fields and hayfields how many mule</v>

753
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 4>deer standing up there before sunset?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shitload.</v>

754
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

755
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 4>So take that amount times 20% or that</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount,</v>

756
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 4>whatever prep sent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have cwd figuring out how many times</v>

757
00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 4>it's a deer defecate or urinate on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>daily basis.</v>

758
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 4>And that's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now think about the possibility that</v>

759
00:39:34.031 --> 00:39:38.890
<v Speaker 4>when you harvest those agricultural food</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuffs and roll it up into big bales,</v>

760
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 4>that you might have fecal material</v>
<v Speaker 4>rolled up into those big bales,</v>

761
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.100
<v Speaker 4>not just Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

762
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely,</v>

763
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd need a graduate student that we</v>

764
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:50.021
<v Speaker 4>could have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

765
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:53.080
<v Speaker 4>pick apart large bales of hay to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>prove that.</v>

766
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

767
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 4>if someone was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly now we're now we're putting</v>

768
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 4>those on semi trailers and moving them</v>
<v Speaker 4>across borders and are those,</v>

769
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a possibility that these</v>

770
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:10.350
<v Speaker 4>agricultural commodities then deer could</v>
<v Speaker 4>come up to them and be infected by</v>

771
00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 4>contact?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we don't know</v>

772
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.750
<v Speaker 3>wharton to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

773
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Brian's a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other folks studying that are</v>

774
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:22.200
<v Speaker 3>scientists and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

775
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.800
<v Speaker 3>it's evidence and it suggests and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get attacked for that,</v>

776
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by people who don't want it to be true.</v>

777
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.061
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

778
00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:32.430
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how science is attacked anyway,</v>

779
00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:36.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's hard to speak in absolutes</v>

780
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:38.250
<v Speaker 3>is a real hard thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

781
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.110
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear him say,</v>

782
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.200
<v Speaker 3>the evidence suggests the information is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

783
00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:47.340
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's a real important</v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction to draw here.</v>

784
00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:48.720
<v Speaker 3>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having those kinds of</v>

785
00:40:48.721 --> 00:40:49.441
<v Speaker 3>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

786
00:40:49.441 --> 00:40:51.120
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people want absolute proof.</v>

787
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Proof is hard in a biological world</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's so many factors out</v>

788
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:57.730
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't control for them all.</v>

789
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>But there are certain tactics that had</v>
<v Speaker 4>been used quite successfully.</v>

790
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Speaker 4>It goes all the way back to smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You now when,</v>

791
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:05.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

792
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

793
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 4>what the tobacco companies were</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking science and the whole idea is</v>

794
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.390
<v Speaker 4>to sow the seeds of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

795
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 4>we've seen actually merchants of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen that.</v>

796
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 4>We see the same thing going on with cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you mentioned it earlier.</v>

797
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

798
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd it's not so bad.</v>

799
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.310
<v Speaker 4>What about winter kill?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about Ehd?</v>

800
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.480
<v Speaker 4>So instead of focusing on that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't look here,</v>

801
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.920
<v Speaker 4>look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is worse.</v>

802
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 4>Why</v>

803
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 2>aren't you doing something about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>

804
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:39.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's a simple diversion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another tactic which is,</v>

805
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and I mean there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a body of scientific</v>

806
00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:46.060
<v Speaker 1>approach this because these are an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrelated issues like Ehd does kill</v>

807
00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:48.130
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winter Til most certainly kills animals,</v>

808
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.510
<v Speaker 1>but we're not talking about the same,</v>

809
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to divert the conversation,</v>

810
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is,</v>

811
00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.670
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.530
<v Speaker 2>it's Cherry picking the literature</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's out that's out there.</v>

813
00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.820
<v Speaker 2>We saw a real great example of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year ago where,</v>

814
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of letters to the editor</v>

815
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.670
<v Speaker 2>being sent into newspapers in areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>where cewd is.</v>

816
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

817
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an attempt to change the conversation.</v>

818
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So they were very careful to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>citations from peer reviewed literature.</v>

819
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ones they used was they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found that in researchers in Wisconsin</v>

820
00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:30.690
<v Speaker 2>found that cwd was not having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant effect on mortality rates</v>

821
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:35.950
<v Speaker 2>when they studied the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a true statement taken</v>

822
00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:40.951
<v Speaker 2>directly from peer reviewed science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they didn't identify was that when</v>

823
00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 2>they studied that disease was between</v>
<v Speaker 2>2003 and 2007 10 12.</v>

824
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 years ago.</v>

825
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Then the next sentence in the paper was</v>
<v Speaker 2>our study can use as a baseline for</v>

826
00:42:55.181 --> 00:42:59.590
<v Speaker 2>comparison at a later point in time</v>
<v Speaker 2>should disease change over time.</v>

827
00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:05.130
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned that exponential growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>curve and how early on back in 2003 to</v>

828
00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:10.351
<v Speaker 2>2007 this area disease prevalence was</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably lower than 5%.</v>

829
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it shot up in that curve and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably in that,</v>

830
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 30,</v>

831
00:43:15.941 --> 00:43:20.680
<v Speaker 2>30 plus percentage range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're cherry picking literature to</v>

832
00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:25.090
<v Speaker 2>make your arguments that even scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>say this is not having a big effect when</v>

833
00:43:25.091 --> 00:43:28.000
<v Speaker 2>they studied it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just not saying when they</v>

834
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:28.750
<v Speaker 2>studied it.</v>

835
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a non scientist,</v>

836
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.370
<v Speaker 1>when I'm looking at here is everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always terrified or the next pandemic</v>

837
00:43:36.371 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the reasons why I</v>

838
00:43:37.841 --> 00:43:40.600
<v Speaker 1>felt was so important to discuss this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

839
00:43:40.601 --> 00:43:43.030
<v Speaker 1>people would say they look at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>casually good,</v>

840
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:45.310
<v Speaker 1>don't eat animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat deer.</v>

841
00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not that.</v>

842
00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 1>This is something that has a potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach large scale agriculture.</v>

843
00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.040
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

844
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about your farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about this when we're</v>

845
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.030
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these animals are farm animals</v>

846
00:43:58.031 --> 00:44:00.670
<v Speaker 1>almost because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely free range.</v>

847
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.650
<v Speaker 1>They're absolutely wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about the deer on your</v>

848
00:44:02.651 --> 00:44:03.760
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

849
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't have them controlled in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

850
00:44:05.531 --> 00:44:07.620
<v Speaker 1>but they're feeding off of your corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

851
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:10.930
<v Speaker 1>They're eating all this stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people eat their eating.</v>

852
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they eat.</v>

853
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.750
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why the deer</v>

854
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 1>populations are so enormous in farm</v>
<v Speaker 1>lands is because it's a massive who</v>

855
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.000
<v Speaker 1>super perfect environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

856
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's also one of the reasons why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>so delicious,</v>

857
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.010
<v Speaker 1>so well fed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

858
00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:25.300
<v Speaker 1>there's so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.300
<v Speaker 1>nutritionally balanced diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

860
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what what's horrifies me is this</v>

861
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 1>potential for a pandemic disease also</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes with an incubation period and that</v>

862
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 1>we are looking potentially at like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just objectively look with no</v>

863
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>hysteria and no hyperbole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the history of diseases,</v>

864
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutate and,</v>

865
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and many of them come from animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why swine flu and avian flu and</v>

866
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:59.841
<v Speaker 1>all these different things have actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from either farm animals or wild</v>

867
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 1>animals that have somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager transmit diseases that have</v>

868
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>morphed to mutated and become dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deadly to human beings.</v>

869
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.410
<v Speaker 1>This to me seems like a ticking time</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>

870
00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 1>He has a potential one switch one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other like you've observed or</v>

871
00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 1>they've observed rather with mice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could potentially infect human</v>

872
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:24.690
<v Speaker 1>beings and spread across the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

873
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:25.524
<v Speaker 1>Like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

874
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing that spread right now in</v>

875
00:45:28.401 --> 00:45:29.480
<v Speaker 2>deere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

876
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Salian dear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing Yale clear geographic</v>

877
00:45:32.961 --> 00:45:35.540
<v Speaker 2>spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing clear increases in</v>

878
00:45:35.541 --> 00:45:39.590
<v Speaker 2>prevalence and in areas where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease has been present the longest</v>

879
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.700
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing population level impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a locations in Wyoming where</v>

880
00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:48.701
<v Speaker 2>we've demonstrated where we've proven</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cwd is driving population decline</v>

881
00:45:48.741 --> 00:45:49.780
<v Speaker 2>and dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's uh,</v>

882
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:53.390
<v Speaker 2>that encapsulates why we should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned about deer.</v>

883
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 2>And is this an mule deer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a mule deer and in wait,</v>

884
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

885
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Speaker 1>And the mule deer have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extended range in terms of like their</v>

886
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 1>migration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that we've</v>

887
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe over the last decade,</v>

888
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that mule deer travel far mall far</v>

889
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 1>longer and far longer distances on</v>
<v Speaker 1>average</v>

890
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we ever saw before I even whitetail</v>

891
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:16.070
<v Speaker 2>scan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an interesting,</v>

892
00:46:16.071 --> 00:46:17.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research tidbit.</v>

893
00:46:17.391 --> 00:46:19.250
<v Speaker 2>The state of Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

894
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got,</v>

895
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.753
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

896
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.160
<v Speaker 2>appears to be a fairly recent cwt</v>
<v Speaker 2>outbreak in the southeastern part of the</v>

897
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're researchers are really trying</v>

898
00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>to get ahead of this and figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>could move this around.</v>

899
00:46:30.291 --> 00:46:33.230
<v Speaker 2>So they went in and captured deer in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjacent area,</v>

900
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but radio telemetry collars on these to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

901
00:46:35.901 --> 00:46:38.440
<v Speaker 2>well just how far do they go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

902
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.850
<v Speaker 2>this was in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an article just about a week ago,</v>

903
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.460
<v Speaker 2>pop popular media article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not published yet,</v>

904
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.180
<v Speaker 2>but they had a doe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single doe coward that went 80 miles,</v>

905
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:52.350
<v Speaker 1>pretty long distance now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 miles circular or 80 miles,</v>

906
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>40 miles as the crow flies from</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Christ.</v>

907
00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.320
<v Speaker 1>So in that 80 miles could potentially be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spreading cwd if it was an infected</v>

908
00:47:00.321 --> 00:47:02.870
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout crops throughout.</v>

909
00:47:02.871 --> 00:47:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

910
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:06.320
<v Speaker 1>and then there's that exponential</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

911
00:47:06.321 --> 00:47:07.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

912
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

913
00:47:08.301 --> 00:47:13.100
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time for it to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>large problem.</v>

914
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And we're seeing that and we're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in richland county.</v>

915
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it crossed the river,</v>

916
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.880
<v Speaker 1>the testing has begun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surveillance testing has been going on.</v>

917
00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>It crossed the river and it just keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and it be in,</v>

918
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different plants,</v>

919
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.620
<v Speaker 1>all these different berries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People could be eating these berries,</v>

920
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 1>eating these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>

921
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>

922
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And they could be potentially consuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pre</v>

923
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.720
<v Speaker 4>well they're being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very clear that there's</v>

924
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 4>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

925
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 4>and I talk with Doug quite a bit about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between exposure and</v>

926
00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 4>disease transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

927
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it is certain that lots of humans are</v>

928
00:47:57.701 --> 00:48:02.530
<v Speaker 4>exposed to disease associated prion</v>
<v Speaker 4>protein from cwd,</v>

929
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 4>unlikely from plant materials as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether that will result in transmission</v>

930
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:11.380
<v Speaker 4>of disease across that species barrier</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an open question.</v>

931
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.680
<v Speaker 4>We absolutely cannot say it will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We absolutely cannot say it will not.</v>

932
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.760
<v Speaker 4>It's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one thing we can though I identify</v>

933
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:26.761
<v Speaker 4>very clearly is that the rate of</v>
<v Speaker 4>exposure is increasing exponentially.</v>

934
00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.900
<v Speaker 4>As disease has a larger geographic</v>
<v Speaker 4>footprint and prevalence goes up.</v>

935
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:37.230
<v Speaker 4>More and more hunters are just by simple</v>
<v Speaker 4>math being exposed to that positive</v>

936
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.870
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're rolling the dice.</v>

937
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.880
<v Speaker 4>And when you do biological experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

938
00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:47.881
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain likelihood that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>see outcome a or outcome be.</v>

939
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 4>So if you keep rolling the dice enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>

940
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you might see an alternative outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We cannot rule that out.</v>

941
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.900
<v Speaker 3>So when we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were on with,</v>

942
00:48:56.901 --> 00:48:57.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

943
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:00.710
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Rinella and I at the farm</v>

944
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.530
<v Speaker 3>immediately podcast number 70 of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

945
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it as the chances are very small</v>

946
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 3>at this point that it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what the CDC and the World</v>

947
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Health Organization says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

948
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.870
<v Speaker 3>the chances are very small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minuscule even,</v>

949
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.930
<v Speaker 3>but they're not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

950
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that we continue to,</v>

951
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.930
<v Speaker 3>that continues to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

952
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:32.480
<v Speaker 3>the concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know you're talking a lot of joe</v>

953
00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:33.500
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

954
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.610
<v Speaker 3>and I get it because after all humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

955
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:42.710
<v Speaker 3>but I've actually begun to focus more on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the effect on the,</v>

956
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:44.390
<v Speaker 3>on the resource,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

957
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.130
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the deer.</v>

958
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tested positive animals.</v>

959
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

960
00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.210
<v Speaker 3>we properly disposed of the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

961
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:54.890
<v Speaker 3>which is a whole nother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

962
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.060
<v Speaker 3>line of discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

963
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm still eating venison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not eating.</v>

964
00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Are you testing the animals to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every one of them.</v>

965
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.630
<v Speaker 3>We test every deer killed on the farm</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

966
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long when you raise a cow,</v>

967
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.320
<v Speaker 3>how long before you kill it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

968
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:14.330
<v Speaker 3>how long do you do grass fed beef?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is actually kind of</v>

969
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.460
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about the deer</v>

970
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.430
<v Speaker 3>whitetail deer on our place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating corn and beans and gmo corn,</v>

971
00:50:22.431 --> 00:50:23.930
<v Speaker 3>gmo beans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alfalfa,</v>

972
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 3>whatever they want to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I control it.</v>

973
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.970
<v Speaker 3>What my grass fed beef eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

974
00:50:27.971 --> 00:50:28.260
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

975
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking my couch now the one</v>

976
00:50:30.451 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>says hello by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling us</v>

977
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

978
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's very controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though my dear [inaudible]</v>

979
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 1>affected your cow well and that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not organic,</v>

980
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.290
<v Speaker 1>my cattle are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

981
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 1>because it is controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How ironic.</v>

982
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have farm animals in</v>

983
00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:57.851
<v Speaker 1>captivity that organic purely eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass as nature intended and you got</v>

984
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:00.360
<v Speaker 1>deer eating Monsanto corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

985
00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:06.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

986
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

987
00:51:08.361 --> 00:51:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and before anybody out there,</v>

988
00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:13.600
<v Speaker 1>it gets the idea that my cattle are</v>
<v Speaker 1>confined in a little barnyard or</v>

989
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big law,</v>

990
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large area,</v>

991
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.290
<v Speaker 1>big pasture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

992
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free ranging within that pasture,</v>

993
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.140
<v Speaker 1>pasture raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

994
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.470
<v Speaker 1>so short answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

995
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 1>with grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

996
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I just sent for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

997
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 1>none of it was ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to bring you some,</v>

998
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:32.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

999
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 1>they just went in on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh</v>

1000
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh would like to see him go through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>security checkpoint caring,</v>

1001
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bags of beef with him.</v>

1002
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.983
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

1003
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:47.060
<v Speaker 1>26 so they were two years old and two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and two months or three</v>

1004
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:47.990
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1005
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.170
<v Speaker 1>what the incubation period that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing earlier,</v>

1006
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you talking about a two year incubation</v>
<v Speaker 1>period with deer before they potentially</v>

1007
00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 1>show any effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these animals would fall into that</v>

1008
00:51:57.591 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 1>line between birth and slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that would be inside that</v>

1009
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:04.190
<v Speaker 1>incubation window for deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1010
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.920
<v Speaker 1>it could be potentially larger for cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

1011
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 2>PSC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the incubation period is between</v>

1012
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 2>three and five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why one of the</v>

1013
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 2>precautionary measures for BSC in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States is we don't allow those</v>

1014
00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 2>older aged cattle into the human food</v>
<v Speaker 2>chain.</v>

1015
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.390
<v Speaker 2>What does BSC stand for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,</v>

1016
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Aka mad cow disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1017
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.470
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the precautionary</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures has not aligned cause to get</v>

1018
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 2>old co for mad cow disease.</v>

1019
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from my standpoint,</v>

1020
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 1>they're prime at 26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 months.</v>

1021
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And so when they are in an incubation</v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

1022
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:45.490
<v Speaker 1>they're still capable of distributing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disease though.</v>

1023
00:52:45.491 --> 00:52:46.324
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>

1024
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what cwd and with scrapey and</v>

1025
00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:54.261
<v Speaker 2>sheep as well with BSC and clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if cwt went into a cow in a,</v>

1026
00:52:55.861 --> 00:52:59.760
<v Speaker 2>in a natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know exactly what it would look</v>

1027
00:52:59.761 --> 00:53:01.770
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what it looks like when we</v>

1028
00:53:01.771 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 2>injected into the brain of account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what it would really</v>

1029
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:08.490
<v Speaker 2>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But BSE is quite different in that.</v>

1030
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>similarly with,</v>

1031
00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.860
<v Speaker 2>with the human prion diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1032
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual with Kourou could not give</v>

1033
00:53:16.741 --> 00:53:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Kourou to another human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to consume it.</v>

1034
00:53:20.101 --> 00:53:23.250
<v Speaker 2>So that with a verse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that artificial process involved,</v>

1035
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>same thing with BSC cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cow</v>

1036
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 4>would be s he can't give BSE to another</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're not shedding that</v>

1037
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:32.520
<v Speaker 4>infectious agent out into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

1038
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:37.570
<v Speaker 3>So when they stopped it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they stop feeding the cows,</v>

1039
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:42.650
<v Speaker 4>that's called transmission cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cwd is a different animal.</v>

1040
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 4>So uwd and just our deputy Yazzie Times</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 on steroids,</v>

1041
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 4>while they're contagious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of freaking me out a little bit</v>

1042
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:53.390
<v Speaker 4>freaky because these animals are</v>
<v Speaker 4>shedding.</v>

1043
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1044
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 4>that infectious agent cows with BSE or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not shedding infectious agent cwd</v>

1045
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:05.020
<v Speaker 4>positive deer and scrape the positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep are these two diseases are unique</v>

1046
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.270
<v Speaker 4>in the world of TSC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>TSC is a prion.</v>

1047
00:54:08.271 --> 00:54:13.271
<v Speaker 4>Diseases are unique amongst themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but scrapey and cwd are in a different</v>

1048
00:54:13.281 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 4>world of their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1049
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.130
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1050
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.050
<v Speaker 4>if anything can be done?</v>

1051
00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to break this stuff down to like</v>

1052
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the most basic level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like me can understand it.</v>

1053
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By time pay for science.</v>

1054
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of one of the things slow</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1055
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.510
<v Speaker 3>this slow the spread of the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of work being done.</v>

1056
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1057
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.750
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of studies being done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1058
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.870
<v Speaker 3>different organizations and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1059
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.040
<v Speaker 3>and the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1060
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:53.380
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as much as we should be doing where,</v>

1061
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a hotbed of it.</v>

1062
00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I think that in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite honestly,</v>

1063
00:54:56.681 --> 00:55:00.310
<v Speaker 3>that we've become an example of how not</v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle the disease.</v>

1064
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of the other states have begun</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1065
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:07.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that idea that if you don't have</v>

1067
00:55:07.391 --> 00:55:08.410
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want it.</v>

1068
00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.940
<v Speaker 3>So let's do what we can to stop it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming here.</v>

1069
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:17.020
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're seeing things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not transfer carcasses that,</v>

1070
00:55:17.021 --> 00:55:18.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's bands on being able to transfer,</v>

1071
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carcasses in Wisconsin and in some cases</v>

1072
00:55:22.181 --> 00:55:26.140
<v Speaker 3>you can't take it to another county.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take the finished meat so you</v>

1073
00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 3>have to bone your meeting in the area</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can take it home.</v>

1074
00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you know,</v>

1075
00:55:31.251 --> 00:55:33.040
<v Speaker 3>is a bit of a problem for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1076
00:55:33.041 --> 00:55:34.660
<v Speaker 3>for some folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1077
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're beginning to stop the movement of,</v>

1078
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:43.240
<v Speaker 3>of captive deer from one farm to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1079
00:55:43.241 --> 00:55:46.870
<v Speaker 3>But that's just recent and there have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been hearings on that lately,</v>

1080
00:55:46.871 --> 00:55:47.704
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1081
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 4>So people resist that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1082
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your,</v>

1083
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:56.210
<v Speaker 4>if your economic vita buy him a vitality</v>
<v Speaker 4>depends on selling and moving live deer,</v>

1084
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.140
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be a post to</v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions on your economic activity.</v>

1085
00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:03.450
<v Speaker 4>That is one of the primary infection</v>
<v Speaker 4>sources.</v>

1086
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.850
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the infectious sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1087
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
<v Speaker 4>So they will always correct you when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>say something like Doug Skating had</v>

1088
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 4>mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like break it down.</v>

1089
00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's a world at 11.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'd think of,</v>

1090
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.150
<v Speaker 4>there's appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two mechanisms,</v>

1091
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:24.820
<v Speaker 4>primary mechanisms if we lump them for</v>
<v Speaker 4>how cwd moves.</v>

1092
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 4>One is dear to deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to deer,</v>

1093
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 4>to deer at slow diffusive process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neo moving out on the landscape that's</v>

1094
00:56:31.271 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 4>really hard to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other one is this anthropogenic or</v>

1095
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 4>human assisted movement where humans are</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving infectious material and that</v>

1096
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 4>might be how it got from Colorado and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin in the first place.</v>

1097
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 4>So highly unlikely that a mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whitetail deer got up,</v>

1098
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:51.300
<v Speaker 4>woke up one morning in Colorado and</v>
<v Speaker 4>decided to go 900 miles,</v>

1099
00:56:51.301 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 4>cross the Mississippi River and settle</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1100
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western Dane County.</v>

1101
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 3>And back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad and a bunch of his buddies used</v>

1102
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 3>to go out to Colorado and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1103
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.410
<v Speaker 3>are Wyoming's actually where they went</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they hunted,</v>

1104
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:04.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1105
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk and mule deer and it ran the whole</v>

1106
00:57:07.931 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 3>damn thing back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1107
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 3>just what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1108
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 3>You put it on the back of the truck and</v>
<v Speaker 3>off you went.</v>

1109
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.970
<v Speaker 3>And then a process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can remember doing it in the garage in</v>

1110
00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Cazenovia as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1111
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 3>working there with knives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great thing.</v>

1112
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Well what do you do with the bones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1113
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1114
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.320
<v Speaker 3>the non meat stuff when you're done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1115
00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 3>back in the day we used to and it still</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

1116
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:32.510
<v Speaker 3>we take it out and put it in a weed</v>
<v Speaker 3>called bone pile.</v>

1117
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Coyote pile or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dumped on the back 40 yeah.</v>

1118
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Well where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where</v>

1119
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:41.460
<v Speaker 4>that's still could have infectivity if</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a positive animal.</v>

1120
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:45.330
<v Speaker 4>So it's a hospital out to Wisconsin is</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows.</v>

1121
00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are so he's,</v>

1122
00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:51.180
<v Speaker 4>he's absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The 25 states that don't have cwd don't</v>

1123
00:57:51.181 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 4>want to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to do everything they can.</v>

1124
00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:54.270
<v Speaker 4>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

1125
00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:58.170
<v Speaker 4>Eastern states or southeastern states</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of the far western states</v>

1126
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 4>haven't picked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1127
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:04.140
<v Speaker 4>If you go to our website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see a map there that shows the</v>

1128
00:58:04.141 --> 00:58:07.200
<v Speaker 4>current known distribution of where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease is.</v>

1129
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.470
<v Speaker 4>So the other states really don't want it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't want it bad.</v>

1130
00:58:10.471 --> 00:58:12.590
<v Speaker 4>So it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1131
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.490
<v Speaker 4>to look at these anthropogenic factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human assisted identify the possible</v>

1132
00:58:17.491 --> 00:58:20.610
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how humans could bring cwd to him,</v>

1133
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:25.970
<v Speaker 4>to you and stop them either with</v>
<v Speaker 4>regulatory frameworks or with education</v>

1134
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:30.630
<v Speaker 4>teaching hunters that it's a risk to</v>
<v Speaker 4>move carcasses around is likely and much</v>

1135
00:58:30.631 --> 00:58:33.750
<v Speaker 4>more effective than just putting a rule</v>
<v Speaker 4>in place that says you can't.</v>

1136
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And there are unscrupulous people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchase dear from these high fence</v>

1137
00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:44.281
<v Speaker 1>operations and release them in the wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want big racks and animals</v>

1138
00:58:44.501 --> 00:58:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that it like people don't know there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>these high fence operations,</v>

1139
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't call them high fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>operations cause some of them are wild</v>

1140
00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:54.550
<v Speaker 1>animals that are contained in a fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are farms,</v>

1141
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>there are farms that grow deer and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow dear with special protein feed.</v>

1142
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:03.661
<v Speaker 1>So they have enormous racks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have these really perverse specie</v>

1143
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:11.230
<v Speaker 1>perverse examples of a deer and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that and it like to,</v>

1144
00:59:11.231 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 1>to someone who enjoys wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see those and you're like,</v>

1145
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like a stripper with triple f test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the fuck did you just do</v>

1146
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.750
<v Speaker 1>like these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look real.</v>

1147
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like 80 points.</v>

1148
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of like an eight point buck,</v>

1149
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:28.911
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>very typical or a 10 point buck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1151
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that monster.</v>

1152
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural animal that lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>

1153
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 1>They have these things that they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even look like deer.</v>

1154
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:37.920
<v Speaker 1>They look</v>

1155
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.680
<v Speaker 4>like some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some cartoon.</v>

1156
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Like that stripper with the triple f</v>
<v Speaker 4>tits.</v>

1157
00:59:45.271 --> 00:59:48.000
<v Speaker 4>There are dudes or go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm digging that.</v>

1158
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's</v>

1159
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.130
<v Speaker 1>vs to all who are in the know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you go over a guy's house and he</v>

1160
00:59:54.131 --> 00:59:55.690
<v Speaker 1>has one of those over his wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1161
00:59:55.691 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 1>did you just walk right out to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and put a pistol in its head?</v>

1162
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Like the deer hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1163
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:01.900
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1164
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not even an a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some weird science project.</v>

1165
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and genetics play a role in will correct</v>

1166
01:00:11.261 --> 01:00:13.780
<v Speaker 4>me when I start to veer off the science</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing here.</v>

1167
01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:15.850
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1168
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.710
<v Speaker 4>genetics play a role in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1169
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.580
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1170
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 4>in bigger deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1171
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.070
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your,</v>

1172
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.000
<v Speaker 4>your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1173
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.730
<v Speaker 4>John Dudley had say the number of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing it.</v>

1174
01:00:24.731 --> 01:00:27.670
<v Speaker 4>The number one way to get big antlered</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer as it's not let them grow.</v>

1175
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Let them get old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let them get old and give them plenty of</v>

1176
01:00:30.341 --> 01:00:31.030
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1177
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But genetics have a role in it.</v>

1178
01:00:33.221 --> 01:00:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

1179
01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:37.300
<v Speaker 4>three factors in production of antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's genetics,</v>

1180
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:41.140
<v Speaker 4>age and nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really the the key three there,</v>

1181
01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:46.740
<v Speaker 4>but now know a lot of places will</v>
<v Speaker 4>identify these as genetically superior.</v>

1182
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Well that's kind of a misnomer when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get back to the definition of fitness,</v>

1183
01:00:51.221 --> 01:00:54.550
<v Speaker 4>genetic fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only one measure of genetic</v>

1184
01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:58.930
<v Speaker 4>fitness and that's how well represented</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are in the next generation.</v>

1185
01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's take an example where we took</v>

1186
01:01:02.171 --> 01:01:07.171
<v Speaker 4>one of the cl 80 point whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's release it out into the wild.</v>

1187
01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.570
<v Speaker 4>And during breeding season it comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>across a prime,</v>

1188
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.680
<v Speaker 4>three and a half or four and a half year</v>
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

1189
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Eight pointer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1190
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.780
<v Speaker 4>This physical specimen that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>witnessed him,</v>

1191
01:01:18.781 --> 01:01:22.870
<v Speaker 4>they're unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now if you put those up against each</v>

1192
01:01:22.871 --> 01:01:27.871
<v Speaker 4>other in a mortal battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know who I'm putting mine my money on</v>

1193
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.630
<v Speaker 4>the wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1194
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1195
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.460
<v Speaker 4>Every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's just so,</v>

1196
01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:36.640
<v Speaker 4>so these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while they're bread,</v>

1197
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much like livestock for very</v>

1198
01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:41.830
<v Speaker 4>specific characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big antlers,</v>

1199
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.280
<v Speaker 4>these don't necessarily translate into</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that would be more fit out in</v>

1200
01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 4>the wall.</v>

1201
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's also point out that the reason why</v>

1202
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as these animals actually do fight to</v>

1203
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>the death and it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill each other in,</v>

1204
01:01:55.591 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>in combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why they have those</v>

1205
01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>antlers in the first pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have them to protect</v>

1206
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>themselves against wolves like Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

1207
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>They literally have them to fight with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>female Caribou have antlers as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have these antlers so that they</v>

1209
01:02:07.401 --> 01:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>could try to fend off animals that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to eat them.</v>

1210
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and elk and deer.</v>

1211
01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They have them for combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why once the breeding season's</v>

1212
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shed them.</v>

1213
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they start all over again.</v>

1214
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting example.</v>

1215
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.460
<v Speaker 2>If you look to history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1216
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 2>it's an animal called the Irish elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's things where they're,</v>

1217
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>they're extinct now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1218
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were twice,</v>

1219
01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 2>three times the size of our normal elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their antlers were measured in feet</v>

1220
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 2>instead of inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1221
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:40.340
<v Speaker 2>And so during their evolutionary time</v>
<v Speaker 2>period when they were on the face of the</v>

1222
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 2>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was when he,</v>

1223
01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>all animals were larger predators were</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger.</v>

1224
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>These things got Gargantuan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1225
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Then they disappeared from the landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at least,</v>

1226
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:51.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they offered author Stephen Jay Gould.</v>

1227
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

1228
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm Stephen Jay Gould has offered up</v>
<v Speaker 2>that likely what occurred was a change</v>

1229
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:04.551
<v Speaker 2>in the habitat that climate changed over</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and that forest grew up.</v>

1230
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the plains and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlers that are seven,</v>

1231
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 2>eight feet wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can walk around.</v>

1232
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:16.200
<v Speaker 2>But now when trees start to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you survive when the world</v>

1233
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 2>around you changed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd have to literally walk with</v>

1234
01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:23.190
<v Speaker 2>your head turned sideways and Irish</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schalchlin extinct.</v>

1235
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:26.310
<v Speaker 2>So there's a very real example of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1236
01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phenotypic characteristic.</v>

1237
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:31.750
<v Speaker 2>These mega antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really in the longterm.</v>

1238
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>We're not in the best interest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

1239
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up a photograph of these farm deer</v>

1240
01:03:37.911 --> 01:03:41.720
<v Speaker 1>antlers just right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just type in google,</v>

1241
01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous farm deer antlers and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of what we're talking about for</v>

1242
01:03:45.741 --> 01:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the people that are watching this on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube because until you see it you</v>

1243
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand how gross it's</v>

1244
01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I think one was called Goliath that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

1246
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Well there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1247
01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there good go.</v>

1248
01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a perfect example.</v>

1249
01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's not a deer like that.</v>

1250
01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy what they've done to that</v>

1251
01:04:07.641 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a product of selection.</v>

1252
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Give breeding there specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics that some people will</v>

1253
01:04:12.411 --> 01:04:13.430
<v Speaker 2>pay a lot of money for.</v>

1254
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a certain high fence</v>

1255
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>operations that you can go online and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they,</v>

1256
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what like look,</v>

1257
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.450
<v Speaker 1>go back to that photo you just had with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy standing there drawing.</v>

1258
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's a drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to so quick.</v>

1260
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing.</v>

1261
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the one behind it though.</v>

1262
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Very normal looking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1263
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a one year old.</v>

1264
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1265
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1266
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these places that have these</v>

1267
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>animals and some people will take these</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and then they import them to</v>

1268
01:04:46.481 --> 01:04:48.150
<v Speaker 1>purchase them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>import them,</v>

1269
01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>and then release them into the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes wild.</v>

1270
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll pretend that that's a</v>

1271
01:04:55.381 --> 01:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>wild animal they shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>

1272
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.300
<v Speaker 1>this is a source of cw.</v>

1273
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 2>They are potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1274
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.120
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So deer has to have cwt in order to be a</v>

1275
01:05:07.121 --> 01:05:07.954
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1276
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's been shown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1277
01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>in the lower 48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just,</v>

1278
01:05:11.651 --> 01:05:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we're at a hundred captive deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and elk facilities that have been shown</v>

1279
01:05:15.701 --> 01:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>to be cwd positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1280
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:18.140
<v Speaker 2>say</v>

1281
01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 4>we can definitively identify that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>captive service industry has been a part</v>

1282
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.680
<v Speaker 4>of moving cwd across the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1283
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 4>we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1284
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:28.490
<v Speaker 4>cwt positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do your,</v>

1285
01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.940
<v Speaker 4>have been moved by the industry even</v>
<v Speaker 4>across,</v>

1286
01:05:30.941 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>international and state lines.</v>

1287
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones in Korea are a great example.</v>

1288
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even we had a recent one where cewd</v>

1289
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:43.600
<v Speaker 4>positive farm in Wisconsin that can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>trace backs where this animal came from.</v>

1290
01:05:43.601 --> 01:05:46.780
<v Speaker 4>It turned out it came from Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a game farm in Pennsylvania,</v>

1291
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 4>and then a doing testing in that source</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard they found additional positives</v>

1292
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 4>there so definitively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now while that's me,</v>

1293
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll say that very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cwe or the captive industry is a</v>

1294
01:05:58.271 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 4>portion of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not the whole equation.</v>

1295
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not the whole equation.</v>

1296
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:04.750
<v Speaker 4>So where did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where did originate?</v>

1297
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 4>He said there were the first testing of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive testing of the stuff was,</v>

1298
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:14.670
<v Speaker 4>it was first described in 1967 in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>research facility in the state of</v>

1299
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:16.084
<v Speaker 4>Colorado.</v>

1300
01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not to say that was the first</v>

1301
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:22.070
<v Speaker 4>instance of cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the first time it was described.</v>

1302
01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Chan dear farms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think dear farms have been around</v>

1303
01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:28.120
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>

1304
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:29.470
<v Speaker 4>if you Google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1305
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.780
<v Speaker 4>tame dear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll find some from the you with the</v>

1306
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.800
<v Speaker 4>late 18 hundreds when photographs became</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible of a deer following people</v>

1307
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we've domesticated animals for a</v>

1308
01:06:41.261 --> 01:06:42.310
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

1309
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:46.340
<v Speaker 4>But as an industry probably really came</v>
<v Speaker 4>into vogue in the,</v>

1310
01:06:46.341 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe the sixties and seventies and more</v>

1311
01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:50.140
<v Speaker 4>recently now it's grown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1312
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 4>that industry has grown exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to work for Texas parks and law,</v>

1313
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 4>but before I worked for USG GS and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1314
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I did was I</v>
<v Speaker 4>administered the deer breeding program</v>

1315
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.630
<v Speaker 4>for the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when I started this,</v>

1316
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.770
<v Speaker 4>I didn't start the program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I came into that,</v>

1317
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:12.900
<v Speaker 4>that role there were administered a well</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer breeders in the state of Texas.</v>

1318
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like many states need a permit from a</v>

1319
01:07:15.821 --> 01:07:18.280
<v Speaker 4>state agency to conduct those</v>
<v Speaker 4>activities.</v>

1320
01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was administrating that</v>

1321
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:26.160
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are around 120 a licensed</v>

1322
01:07:26.161 --> 01:07:29.140
<v Speaker 4>to breeding facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whitetail deer breeding facilities in</v>

1323
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 4>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At that point in time,</v>

1324
01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years later when I left parks and</v>

1325
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 4>wildlife in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're around six or 700 so it just</v>

1326
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:42.931
<v Speaker 4>grew exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now I believe they're there around a</v>

1327
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 4>thousand captive deer facilities in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of Texas,</v>

1328
01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.730
<v Speaker 4>cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pennsylvania.</v>

1329
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 4>There's around a thousand of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ohio's got several hundred,</v>

1330
01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin's got a couple hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1331
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 4>so I'd say they're part of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to,</v>

1332
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to place all the blame for</v>

1333
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:05.500
<v Speaker 4>cwd moving it around because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>other possibilities for how this disease</v>

1334
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.010
<v Speaker 4>moves around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1335
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.780
<v Speaker 4>doug hit on a one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1336
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 4>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of carcass movement.</v>

1337
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:14.870
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't been proven that this occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

1338
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 4>when</v>

1339
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you look at it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific standpoint,</v>

1340
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:21.230
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to identify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

1341
01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1342
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I butcher my own deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I kill a deer,</v>

1343
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 2>it happens to have cwd a butcher my own</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear,</v>

1344
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do something with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1345
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1346
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat component in a deer is probably</v>

1347
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:34.850
<v Speaker 2>around 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35%,</v>

1348
01:08:34.851 --> 01:08:36.890
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got a lot of other stuff.</v>

1349
01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Landfills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out,</v>

1350
01:08:38.871 --> 01:08:42.380
<v Speaker 2>are very loathe to accept this material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1351
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.170
<v Speaker 2>it's almost taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know who it might have cwd so we don't</v>

1352
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>want it at our landfill because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>effluent might be pumped out onto a</v>

1353
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:50.570
<v Speaker 2>farmer's field and they could come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1354
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.390
<v Speaker 2>they see it as a liability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1355
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten my deer bones and,</v>

1356
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:01.220
<v Speaker 2>and awful the rest of the material and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive to the dump,</v>

1357
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.470
<v Speaker 2>which is 25 miles away.</v>

1358
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1359
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:07.280
<v Speaker 2>we're not taking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now what am I going to do with this</v>

1360
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could double bag it,</v>

1361
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit at a time and put it out in</v>

1362
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:11.900
<v Speaker 2>the trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1363
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.310
<v Speaker 2>or maybe on the way home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving past a state owned or state</v>

1364
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 2>park or a state natural area or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife management area,</v>

1365
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:23.700
<v Speaker 2>and I see a trail go down there and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive down that trail and there's a pile</v>

1366
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:28.120
<v Speaker 2>of deer bones and their heads here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops man.</v>

1367
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Did I knocked that over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that Joe.</v>

1368
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's easy to see how inadvertently</v>

1369
01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.270
<v Speaker 3>just hold your thought when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a microphone.</v>

1370
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.353
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1371
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.380
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1372
01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.590
<v Speaker 3>and it is one of the w one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerns is how are we,</v>

1373
01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

1374
01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.420
<v Speaker 3>what kind of hygiene do we have with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>carcasses?</v>

1375
01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.950
<v Speaker 3>So this is something that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a lot more in Wisconsin now and</v>

1376
01:09:55.951 --> 01:09:57.760
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's become an issue in one of the,</v>

1377
01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.430
<v Speaker 3>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the county deer advisory committee</v>

1378
01:10:00.431 --> 01:10:02.290
<v Speaker 3>for Richland County and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1379
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:05.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a citizen group and we have some</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in,</v>

1380
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1381
01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.080
<v Speaker 3>seasoned structure and then how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>antler this permits.</v>

1382
01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:12.580
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things we don't have</v>

1383
01:10:12.581 --> 01:10:16.180
<v Speaker 3>any say in which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather leave it to the biologists,</v>

1384
01:10:16.181 --> 01:10:19.060
<v Speaker 3>but because there are a hunter's</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved,</v>

1385
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1386
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:25.210
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happen in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>inner spring hearings is that we had</v>

1387
01:10:25.211 --> 01:10:27.040
<v Speaker 3>folks come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1388
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:28.560
<v Speaker 3>we're concerned about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1389
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:31.480
<v Speaker 3>chronic wasting disease and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to spread it on the landscape,</v>

1390
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:33.970
<v Speaker 3>but when we put the bones out on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>curb,</v>

1391
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:36.590
<v Speaker 3>they aren't taking it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1392
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin Dnr cewd website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a list of haulers who will take</v>

1393
01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:43.390
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are some that will take it.</v>

1394
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.260
<v Speaker 3>There are some who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my grandmas were they taking it?</v>

1395
01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking it to clay lined,</v>

1396
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>land landfills and</v>

1397
01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.020
<v Speaker 3>how it's being handled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1398
01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:57.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some question but it can be</v>

1399
01:10:57.791 --> 01:11:00.400
<v Speaker 3>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the effluent isn't being taken out</v>

1400
01:11:00.401 --> 01:11:01.900
<v Speaker 3>and pumped out the fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that you,</v>

1401
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:02.850
<v Speaker 3>we can do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1402
01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's PR,</v>

1403
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.920
<v Speaker 2>there's clear science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1404
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we noted how prions bind to various</v>

1405
01:11:08.461 --> 01:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>surfaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bind to clay particles very,</v>

1406
01:11:11.011 --> 01:11:14.240
<v Speaker 2>very tightly and say one of researchers</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Uwm,</v>

1407
01:11:14.241 --> 01:11:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Madison's name's Joel Patterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1408
01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Tom was looking at this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:21.280
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago to try and figure out is</v>
<v Speaker 2>can it be safe?</v>

1410
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:23.670
<v Speaker 2>We'd done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out if you put about an eight</v>

1411
01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>inch clay liner underneath Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one portion of your landfill,</v>

1412
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>you can put all the deer and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prions there that you want to and allow</v>

1413
01:11:32.161 --> 01:11:34.500
<v Speaker 2>the preop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will then migrate down,</v>

1414
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time through the soil.</v>

1415
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.450
<v Speaker 2>When they come in contact with a play</v>
<v Speaker 2>clay particles,</v>

1416
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:44.510
<v Speaker 2>they bind and they don't go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it can be completely safely done.</v>

1417
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a way to dispose of these</v>

1418
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:51.420
<v Speaker 2>materials very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very safely.</v>

1419
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:53.310
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1420
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:56.310
<v Speaker 2>the thought of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk associated with it,</v>

1421
01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:57.900
<v Speaker 2>the liability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1422
01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some landfill owners are just like,</v>

1423
01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd rather not,</v>

1424
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 3>interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were challenged about this,</v>

1425
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.070
<v Speaker 3>what are we supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can incinerate it,</v>

1426
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.241
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they'll,</v>

1427
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ends up being a budget issue in</v>

1428
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's a budget issue.</v>

1429
01:12:12.841 --> 01:12:15.150
<v Speaker 3>And the DNR is having,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1430
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.070
<v Speaker 3>issues with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is something that I'd like to talk</v>

1431
01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:17.904
<v Speaker 3>about a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1432
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1433
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.170
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1434
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 3>when this all first happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1435
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.360
<v Speaker 3>in 17 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were incinerating urine.</v>

1436
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 3>It became a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1438
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:31.740
<v Speaker 3>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1439
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 3>landfills that are taking it and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>our haulers who will take it.</v>

1440
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.890
<v Speaker 3>They have dumpsters that they use</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically for it.</v>

1441
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:39.650
<v Speaker 3>They're aligned with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1442
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy mil plastic that it's,</v>

1443
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:45.590
<v Speaker 3>they're very specific to deer bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1444
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.490
<v Speaker 3>but some haulers aren't doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I contacted the head of a solid waste</v>

1445
01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>for the state of Wisconsin and asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1446
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.590
<v Speaker 3>how is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go on your website and I see some take</v>

1447
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:56.424
<v Speaker 3>it and some don't.</v>

1448
01:12:56.610 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 3>And her response was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no legislative authority to</v>

1449
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:05.541
<v Speaker 3>require them to take this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some are doing it voluntarily.</v>

1450
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.400
<v Speaker 3>And actually one solid waste haulers</v>
<v Speaker 3>said to me,</v>

1451
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Geez,</v>

1452
01:13:10.021 --> 01:13:12.050
<v Speaker 3>we're putting a hell of a lot worse</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in the,</v>

1453
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:14.090
<v Speaker 3>in the landfills then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1454
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 3>some deer bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1455
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.071
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1456
01:13:17.071 --> 01:13:18.300
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's simple hygiene.</v>

1457
01:13:18.301 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 3>So one of the efforts that we're working</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in,</v>

1458
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:23.410
<v Speaker 3>in southwest Wisconsin right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1459
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a funding issue,</v>

1460
01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to put place dumpsters in areas</v>

1461
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.850
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1462
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm volunteering to have one on my</v>

1463
01:13:34.111 --> 01:13:36.030
<v Speaker 3>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a question of who's going to pay</v>

1464
01:13:36.031 --> 01:13:37.590
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it comes down to it,</v>

1465
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:41.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pay for the damn dumpster</v>
<v Speaker 3>on or about 500 bucks for a 20 yard</v>

1466
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:41.874
<v Speaker 3>dumpster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1467
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that then,</v>

1468
01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can come by,</v>

1469
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.620
<v Speaker 3>throw their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put their bones in that dumpster,</v>

1470
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.780
<v Speaker 3>and then there'll be properly disposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>of because we have a,</v>

1471
01:13:49.781 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 3>a hauler near us who's said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're willing to bring them there.</v>

1472
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.073
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1473
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring the dumpster there and then</v>

1474
01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.740
<v Speaker 3>dispose of the bones properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they do with,</v>

1475
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:00.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1476
01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 3>at our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1477
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.270
<v Speaker 3>and one of the lockers that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>butcher shops that,</v>

1478
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>processes deer,</v>

1479
01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 3>they have the setup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually when I saw this when I</v>

1480
01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well wait,</v>

1481
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.650
<v Speaker 3>why aren't we doing that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1482
01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>countywide and in various so that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't chucking them in the ditch.</v>

1483
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you're holding onto the damn</v>

1484
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 3>bones until you find out whether the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1485
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:23.110
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're being completely careful about</v>

1486
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 3>the hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we,</v>

1487
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to do and I'm telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1488
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.160
<v Speaker 3>you got a pile of bones in the old milk</v>
<v Speaker 3>house down there until you find out</v>

1489
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:33.850
<v Speaker 3>whether it's positive or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm literally keeping it the deer</v>

1490
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:39.540
<v Speaker 3>bones separate so that when I find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that deer a was non-positive well,</v>

1491
01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:42.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can put those out or something like</v>

1492
01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:43.024
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1493
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's one of the things,</v>

1494
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:46.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a difference between what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

1495
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's natural spreading of the disease</v>

1496
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.770
<v Speaker 3>and then there's human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like putting them on trucks and move</v>

1497
01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>them around or taking the bones around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and doing its carcass thing.</v>

1498
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Is it really a low hanging fruit and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that we can't fix this one,</v>

1499
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

1500
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:03.503
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1501
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:05.500
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>

1502
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 3>It seems easy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1503
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:10.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just a matter of will and money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1504
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.530
<v Speaker 3>and education obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1505
01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 3>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're providing opportunity for this.</v>

1506
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I've been working with the dnr a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit on this.</v>

1507
01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:20.040
<v Speaker 3>We're in some discussions about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1508
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:24.370
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is a self service kiosk,</v>

1509
01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 3>so to make getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1510
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 3>getting your deer test that easier where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to essentially cut the head off</v>

1511
01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:32.880
<v Speaker 3>the deer and leave it in a kiosk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1512
01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.630
<v Speaker 3>with some information about where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1513
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.081
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
01:15:35.081 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 3>they're fairly simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been doing this for a couple of</v>

1515
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.450
<v Speaker 3>years on an experimental basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1516
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:40.620
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a,</v>

1517
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a budget issue.</v>

1518
01:15:42.431 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 3>So we're hoping that we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do is start something called</v>

1519
01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:48.840
<v Speaker 3>adopt a kiosk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially that hunters and people who</v>

1520
01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:49.990
<v Speaker 3>are at sportsman's groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1521
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1522
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 3>gather those heads and then take them</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the testing facility and therefore,</v>

1523
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the budget money targeted at doing</v>

1524
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:05.311
<v Speaker 3>the actual testing right next to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a self service kiosk really should</v>

1525
01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:11.041
<v Speaker 3>be a dumpster that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can throw your deer bones into</v>

1526
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 3>whether you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's positive or not,</v>

1527
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:16.270
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you are holding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that the dnr suggests</v>

1528
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.790
<v Speaker 3>that we do is if you killed the deer on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your farm,</v>

1529
01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:23.620
<v Speaker 3>leave the bones on your farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes sense to me that way if it is</v>

1530
01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:28.621
<v Speaker 3>positive diseases already there and said</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking his grand a chance at</v>

1531
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>moving it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an optimal solution to leave</v>

1532
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 3>that stuff on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the ground surface.</v>

1533
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:39.520
<v Speaker 3>And an optimal solution is dig a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's pretty hard to take sometimes</v>

1534
01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:41.440
<v Speaker 3>in December in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1535
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:42.703
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

1536
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 3>if the dumpsters thing doesn't end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out with me,</v>

1537
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:48.580
<v Speaker 3>there will be a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean last year we just kept the bone</v>

1538
01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:50.680
<v Speaker 3>separate and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ones that we,</v>

1539
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:51.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually took the,</v>

1540
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the from the one deer was they went into</v>

1541
01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:56.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dumpster at the locker.</v>

1542
01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this all seems to me,</v>

1543
01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.230
<v Speaker 3>sorry to interrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this all seems to be like bandaids</v>

1544
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Speaker 3>on massive gunshot wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1545
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 3>But go back to what I was saying before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's buy time,</v>

1546
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:09.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause this</v>

1547
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>shit's spreading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1548
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's buy time and pay for science.</v>

1549
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Not Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing we can do about it or</v>

1550
01:17:15.891 --> 01:17:17.870
<v Speaker 2>the other one that it's always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1551
01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.340
<v Speaker 2>which I think the guitar player talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1552
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Is there any consideration whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there could potentially be a cure?</v>

1553
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1554
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:28.490
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hit on a couple of things.</v>

1555
01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important to talk just very</v>
<v Speaker 2>briefly about some paid generic disease</v>

1556
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 2>management practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one.</v>

1557
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beetle,</v>

1558
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 2>wildlife disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human disease,</v>

1559
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.340
<v Speaker 2>livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease prevention,</v>

1560
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.080
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have it,</v>

1561
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.670
<v Speaker 2>don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do everything you can.</v>

1562
01:17:43.671 --> 01:17:45.620
<v Speaker 2>That's why we get vaccinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1563
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:50.621
<v Speaker 2>For various diseases if you do get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see is do everything you can to keep</v>

1564
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:54.620
<v Speaker 2>from moving it artificially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why we don't want to move the</v>

1565
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 2>carcasses around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you know we don't want to</v>

1566
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:58.000
<v Speaker 2>move captive deer or not.</v>

1567
01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.280
<v Speaker 2>That's why we went when we had an ebola</v>
<v Speaker 2>outbreak in 2015 in Liberia and Ivory</v>

1568
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Coast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stopped commercial airline flights.</v>

1569
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We didn't want people inadvertently</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving it up.</v>

1570
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.500
<v Speaker 2>So prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't move it around.</v>

1571
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Conduct surveillance around areas where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is to see what's going on in states</v>

1572
01:18:17.871 --> 01:18:20.180
<v Speaker 2>are doing that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Largely.</v>

1573
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 2>The next one is a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do something about disease manage</v>

1574
01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 2>disease to try and knock down prevalence</v>
<v Speaker 2>incidence and get rid of the disease.</v>

1575
01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 2>So that's challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But two other things.</v>

1576
01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Number one is support research because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't have a cure today,</v>

1577
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:39.350
<v Speaker 2>we won't have one tomorrow either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is resorts funded right now?</v>

1578
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Either by states or by the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and there's not a ton of</v>

1579
01:18:43.881 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last one is being transparent with</v>

1580
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 2>your stakeholders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being open and communicative with them.</v>

1581
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's with many diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have good therapeutics,</v>

1582
01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can treat some diseases cwd and other</v>

1583
01:18:58.671 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 2>prion diseases.</v>

1584
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 2>We have no therapeutics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no treatments right now,</v>

1585
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 2>but people are certainly working towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1586
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:09.290
<v Speaker 2>That's so likely it's going to be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging to create a therapeutic,</v>

1587
01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:13.850
<v Speaker 2>something that treats a prion disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>because treatment would then mean you</v>

1588
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 2>would have to get past the blood brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>barrier.</v>

1589
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 2>And once you start this cascading</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction of normal prion to disease</v>

1590
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:23.510
<v Speaker 2>associated preamps in the central</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system,</v>

1591
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really challenging to stop that.</v>

1592
01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:27.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1593
01:19:27.411 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a roller coaster gone awry by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time it gets up into the brain.</v>

1594
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:33.710
<v Speaker 2>So then you're looking at preventative</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures,</v>

1595
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:38.830
<v Speaker 2>the idea of vaccines as number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And number two is looking at animals</v>

1596
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:43.340
<v Speaker 2>that through their genetic profile are</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistant to disease.</v>

1597
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's some advances on each front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can talk about vaccines for a</v>

1598
01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:50.370
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1599
01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 2>so people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual scientist's research outfits</v>

1600
01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:57.040
<v Speaker 2>have been trying to develop vaccines for</v>
<v Speaker 2>tss,</v>

1601
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:59.390
<v Speaker 2>for prion diseases for a long time.</v>

1602
01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None have been successful.</v>

1603
01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:04.880
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no human prion disease vaccines.</v>

1604
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:06.740
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing for BSC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing for,</v>

1605
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.010
<v Speaker 2>but there's research ongoing and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been some advances.</v>

1606
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:16.080
<v Speaker 2>There is a Canadian research group that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a vaccine candidate for cwd.</v>

1607
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:19.170
<v Speaker 2>They thought it looked very promising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to a field,</v>

1608
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 2>a production stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually tried deploying this</v>

1609
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 2>vaccine in a captive facility in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming.</v>

1610
01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.420
<v Speaker 2>Can I research facility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out that this vaccine was not</v>

1611
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 2>ready for prime time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually after,</v>

1612
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:35.910
<v Speaker 2>after a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving this vaccine to some elk,</v>

1613
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:40.850
<v Speaker 2>giving a placebo facebow to other elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then leaving him in a conceit obd</v>

1614
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 2>contaminated facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually the vaccinated animals got cwd</v>

1615
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:49.020
<v Speaker 2>faster and at a higher rate than the non</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinated animals.</v>

1616
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.450
<v Speaker 2>So it turned out to be almost an anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccine.</v>

1617
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't work.</v>

1618
01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:53.660
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1619
01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.020
<v Speaker 1>being an earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of active cwd in the</v>

1620
01:20:57.021 --> 01:20:57.530
<v Speaker 1>vaccine.</v>

1621
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1622
01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:00.470
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

1623
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.290
<v Speaker 2>it that exceed supposed it predisposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals.</v>

1624
01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.050
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a massive failure.</v>

1625
01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 2>But even from failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn,</v>

1626
01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're working now in base,</v>

1627
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learned a lot in that experiment.</v>

1628
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:17.150
<v Speaker 2>There's another research group centered</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the university in New York who</v>

1629
01:21:17.151 --> 01:21:21.410
<v Speaker 2>published a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in 2015 was her most recent</v>

1630
01:21:21.411 --> 01:21:25.160
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've got a vaccine candidate that</v>

1631
01:21:25.161 --> 01:21:28.280
<v Speaker 2>provides some degree of protection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote,</v>

1632
01:21:28.281 --> 01:21:32.720
<v Speaker 2>protection from disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all but one of the animals that they</v>

1633
01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:37.070
<v Speaker 2>gave this vaccine to and then challenged</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cwt got cwd.</v>

1634
01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not good news.</v>

1635
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But the average incubation time was</v>
<v Speaker 2>extended.</v>

1636
01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:45.530
<v Speaker 2>That's something like 300 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1637
01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So they're on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a mechanism that is somehow</v>

1638
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:54.970
<v Speaker 2>interfering with the conversion from</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal host prion protein to the disease</v>

1639
01:21:54.991 --> 01:21:57.680
<v Speaker 2>associated form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very valuable.</v>

1640
01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Now will they get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know so,</v>

1641
01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:05.330
<v Speaker 2>but think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if we do create a vaccine that</v>

1642
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:09.230
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that prevents cwd and prevent as opposed</v>

1643
01:22:09.231 --> 01:22:11.600
<v Speaker 2>to slowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very big distinction.</v>

1644
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:15.890
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a vaccine that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>average course of disease three years</v>

1645
01:22:15.891 --> 01:22:18.560
<v Speaker 2>instead of two years or four years</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of two years,</v>

1646
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 2>they still have cwd are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1647
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Dear farms that have 100% negative cwd</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer and them like none of them test</v>

1648
01:22:29.021 --> 01:22:29.854
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1649
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.170
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of dairy farms have</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had cwd the vast majority.</v>

1650
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:35.173
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1651
01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:40.290
<v Speaker 1>There is a potential that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate these populations of completely</v>

1652
01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:46.900
<v Speaker 1>cwd free deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if there's some sort of a mass die</v>

1653
01:22:46.901 --> 01:22:49.630
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could reintroduce these deer into</v>

1654
01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:50.464
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>

1655
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1656
01:22:51.261 --> 01:22:52.550
<v Speaker 2>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1657
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.610
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a giant,</v>

1658
01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.410
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at the difference there</v>
<v Speaker 2>between a herd that is cwd free,</v>

1659
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 2>which means it likely hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to cwd versus animals are cwd</v>

1660
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.870
<v Speaker 2>resistant through genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1661
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>So today we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have not seen any deer that are</v>

1662
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:18.820
<v Speaker 2>genetically completely resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are different genotypes of the</v>

1663
01:23:18.821 --> 01:23:23.821
<v Speaker 2>prion protein gene out there that do</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact the length of disease and also</v>

1664
01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:29.860
<v Speaker 2>seem to have some impact on how often</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frequency that these animals get</v>

1665
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even the genetically resistant deer</v>

1666
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:38.080
<v Speaker 2>do get cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1667
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:40.660
<v Speaker 2>They get admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get it at a lower rate,</v>

1668
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>they likely transmit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're likely shedding infectious</v>

1669
01:23:43.571 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 2>agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of that,</v>

1670
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 2>that kind of garden variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two year incubation period,</v>

1671
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 2>it might be closer to a five year</v>
<v Speaker 2>incubation period.</v>

1672
01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.960
<v Speaker 2>So now for on the one hand you're gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1673
01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Most deer die before they're five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old anyway,</v>

1674
01:23:58.241 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 2>so this would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the downside,</v>

1675
01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a population of</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that have cwd with all these</v>

1676
01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:09.640
<v Speaker 2>other side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're shedding infectious agent out</v>

1677
01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:10.830
<v Speaker 2>into the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1678
01:24:10.831 --> 01:24:13.670
<v Speaker 2>that and the other and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause a,</v>

1679
01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 2>a potential risk to human and other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other health impacts on the landscape.</v>

1680
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:22.450
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not so certain that this is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a success story,</v>

1681
01:24:22.451 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 2>just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a vaccine that results in a longer</v>

1682
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 2>course of disease where there are deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get cwd but they die from something</v>

1683
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:33.460
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A population of,</v>

1684
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 2>of resistant animals that have as a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence of cwd.</v>

1685
01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't see that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable end point because of the other</v>

1686
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>consequences and potential repercussions</v>
<v Speaker 2>must be more desirable for killed him</v>

1687
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 2>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A shorter incubation period would be</v>

1688
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.040
<v Speaker 2>preferable.</v>

1689
01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then you have the,</v>

1690
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like engineering deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive longer,</v>

1691
01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.790
<v Speaker 1>gives them more potential to spread it</v>

1692
01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:59.670
<v Speaker 2>absolutely sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1693
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:02.420
<v Speaker 2>recently sent out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's claims that,</v>

1694
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:04.580
<v Speaker 2>and there's research going on in some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1695
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>at farms to dear farms that they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>identified genetic markers,</v>

1696
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:13.160
<v Speaker 2>ones that are not published in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature yet that are affording a</v>

1697
01:25:13.161 --> 01:25:15.710
<v Speaker 2>higher degree of protection from</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1698
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:19.850
<v Speaker 2>But until it's published in the peer</v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewed literature and really tested</v>

1699
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:21.163
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1700
01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a speaking point until that point</v>
<v Speaker 2>in time.</v>

1701
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know if they'll get there.</v>

1702
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:30.260
<v Speaker 1>We've got to put a fence around</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin dog giant one 30 feet high.</v>

1703
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1704
01:25:31.071 --> 01:25:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 30 feet.</v>

1705
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:35.490
<v Speaker 1>The Northern Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no northeast style.</v>

1706
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:39.280
<v Speaker 1>All the places that have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 but so what happened?</v>

1707
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Half Alaska doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Alaska have it?</v>

1708
01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Not that we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1709
01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1710
01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.273
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1711
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:50.660
<v Speaker 1>So lower 48,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 it's more than 50% then more than 50%</v>

1712
01:25:50.661 --> 01:25:52.490
<v Speaker 1>of the states have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1713
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:54.720
<v Speaker 1>25 out of 48.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1714
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:58.970
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that it just can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be dismissed.</v>

1715
01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that's a hoax.</v>

1716
01:26:01.311 --> 01:26:04.150
<v Speaker 1>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason people were upset,</v>

1717
01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1718
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Ted said on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very good reason.</v>

1719
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1720
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.020
<v Speaker 3>if I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1721
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I play guitar and a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Want to learn some kickass Detroit</v>

1722
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Guitar riffs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to listen to Ted nugent.</v>

1723
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 3>If I want to learn about cwd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna listen to [inaudible] in</v>

1724
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Richardson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like him.</v>

1725
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:20.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

1726
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>ted does know a lot about hunting and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows a lot of wildlife.</v>

1727
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot about conservation,</v>

1728
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 3>but it appears that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1729
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.860
<v Speaker 3>very misinformed or under informed.</v>

1730
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Let me try and put this in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1731
01:26:34.691 --> 01:26:38.470
<v Speaker 2>So you have a disease which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>contagious,</v>

1732
01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.850
<v Speaker 2>so always fatal upon close clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always invitation,</v>

1733
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:46.000
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent fatal deer don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive if humans don't survive prion</v>

1734
01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:47.860
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it enters the central nervous</v>

1735
01:26:47.861 --> 01:26:49.750
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a death sentence.</v>

1736
01:26:50.230 --> 01:26:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's contagious.</v>

1737
01:26:53.290 --> 01:26:55.360
<v Speaker 2>It's fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neurodegenerative disorder,</v>

1738
01:26:55.361 --> 01:26:57.790
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be a horrible way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1739
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 2>So that's a pretty significant set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical signs or symptoms in an</v>

1740
01:27:02.621 --> 01:27:03.730
<v Speaker 2>individual animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1741
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let's look at the geographic spread.</v>

1742
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Rampid geographic spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has an ever expanding geographic</v>

1743
01:27:11.141 --> 01:27:15.160
<v Speaker 2>footprint in areas where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been known the longest.</v>

1744
01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:17.860
<v Speaker 2>We now have prevalence in a cohort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

1745
01:27:17.861 --> 01:27:21.880
<v Speaker 2>adult male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so around 50% and in adult females</v>

1746
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:26.860
<v Speaker 2>around 30%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you name any other disease of</v>

1747
01:27:26.861 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish,</v>

1748
01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:30.040
<v Speaker 2>domestic livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>

1749
01:27:30.041 --> 01:27:33.550
<v Speaker 2>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else that has that set of</v>

1750
01:27:33.551 --> 01:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>characteristics and that degree of</v>
<v Speaker 2>penetrants into the population and you</v>

1751
01:27:38.051 --> 01:27:40.360
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no big deal.</v>

1752
01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of one.</v>

1753
01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.140
<v Speaker 3>There was a one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is obviously very,</v>

1754
01:27:47.141 --> 01:27:49.090
<v Speaker 3>very significant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the reasons why I wanted</v>

1755
01:27:49.091 --> 01:27:53.320
<v Speaker 3>to have you guys off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask Jamie to pull up some</v>

1756
01:27:53.321 --> 01:27:56.800
<v Speaker 3>photos of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of clinical cwd deer or elk.</v>

1757
01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you had something and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of took him down photos of the ones</v>

1758
01:27:59.981 --> 01:28:01.630
<v Speaker 3>that are sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1759
01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:06.640
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>24 month plus or minus a incubation</v>

1760
01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:08.710
<v Speaker 3>period in the last six to eight weeks or</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical.</v>

1761
01:28:09.190 --> 01:28:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1762
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:12.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta tell you,</v>

1763
01:28:12.011 --> 01:28:13.120
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I killed this dear,</v>

1764
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:15.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti tested positive.</v>

1765
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tested positive in the office.</v>

1766
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:25.670
<v Speaker 2>That one's not cewd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the one before that one.</v>

1767
01:28:25.671 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 2>What is that Scott?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of that was called,</v>

1768
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:29.730
<v Speaker 2>that's a cutaneous fibromas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1769
01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.330
<v Speaker 2>there are tumors that grow on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface of the skin.</v>

1770
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Pretty grotesque looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are that,</v>

1771
01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a virus.</v>

1772
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1773
01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:44.270
<v Speaker 2>if you get those awards and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fibromas on your eyes and they block</v>

1774
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 2>your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

1775
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.560
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stressor on animals and you can</v>

1776
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:49.760
<v Speaker 2>actually eat down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

1777
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:50.623
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think</v>

1778
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 3>chronic wasting disease that Jamie's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>up there,</v>

1779
01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:56.690
<v Speaker 3>the larger image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll down what it is that,</v>

1780
01:28:56.691 --> 01:28:57.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1781
01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.750
<v Speaker 2>that's likely cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1782
01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pick the one that's on the row</v>

1783
01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>underneath</v>

1784
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.370
<v Speaker 4>the second one from the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one that the buck there.</v>

1785
01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:09.630
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1786
01:29:09.631 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a photograph.</v>

1787
01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had on there.</v>

1788
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.220
<v Speaker 4>So that was taken by a game warden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1789
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Michael A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopper is his name was in the state of</v>

1790
01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 4>Kansas and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1791
01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:27.540
<v Speaker 4>this diseases has a pretty decent</v>
<v Speaker 4>footprint in Kansas as a game warden.</v>

1792
01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 4>He had gets calls about deer acting</v>
<v Speaker 4>funny and so he's taken a number of good</v>

1793
01:29:34.531 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 4>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can zoom in on that photo,</v>

1794
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you can look at what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out of that.</v>

1795
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:45.291
<v Speaker 4>Deer is mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that stream of saliva that's all</v>

1796
01:29:45.811 --> 01:29:49.560
<v Speaker 4>filled with infectious material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's one of the clinical signs is</v>

1797
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:51.470
<v Speaker 4>it's hypersalivation well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

1798
01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:55.790
<v Speaker 4>that's a wild deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost like this disease's</v>

1799
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:59.130
<v Speaker 4>trying to spread itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been pretty efficient.</v>

1800
01:29:59.190 --> 01:29:59.941
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1801
01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by doing that,</v>

1802
01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:05.820
<v Speaker 4>by forcing these animals to have all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>saliva excretion,</v>

1803
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 4>this is a very effective means of</v>
<v Speaker 4>transmitting this disease throughout</v>

1804
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:13.320
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the set of characteristics of this whole</v>

1805
01:30:13.321 --> 01:30:17.810
<v Speaker 4>disease where the protracted incubation</v>
<v Speaker 4>period shedding infectious agents</v>

1806
01:30:17.811 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 4>through bodily fluids for the majority</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that incubation period,</v>

1807
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.291
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1808
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:26.190
<v Speaker 4>the infectious agent persistently</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment for years out to decades.</v>

1809
01:30:26.190 --> 01:30:28.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to stack the deck for</v>

1810
01:30:28.111 --> 01:30:30.060
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't come up with a better set</v>

1811
01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:33.390
<v Speaker 4>of characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus they look perfectly healthy.</v>

1812
01:30:33.391 --> 01:30:36.030
<v Speaker 4>So we have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1813
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:39.060
<v Speaker 4>that they're there that are diseased</v>
<v Speaker 4>until later on in,</v>

1814
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:40.860
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the disease progression.</v>

1815
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Now is there a prevalence in or is there</v>
<v Speaker 4>a higher prevalence in deer versus moose</v>

1816
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:51.711
<v Speaker 4>versus a elk or anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tend to see higher prevalence in the</v>

1817
01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Speaker 4>deer species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whitetail deer mule deer in isolated</v>

1818
01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we do in either elk moose,</v>

1819
01:30:59.611 --> 01:31:01.140
<v Speaker 4>there's only been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1820
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:04.140
<v Speaker 4>worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there may be only been 10 positive moose</v>

1821
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.490
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To date.</v>

1822
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:08.250
<v Speaker 4>And it's likely in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't seem that they're less</v>

1823
01:31:08.251 --> 01:31:10.500
<v Speaker 4>susceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just that they're likely haven't</v>

1824
01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:13.950
<v Speaker 4>been exposed because they're not in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same systems.</v>

1825
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:17.850
<v Speaker 4>And there are moose tend to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>solitary,</v>

1826
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:20.470
<v Speaker 4>solitary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely Wisconsin,</v>

1827
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:26.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>periodically a single a yearling,</v>

1828
01:31:26.011 --> 01:31:29.040
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll wander down from a northeastern</v>

1829
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:30.330
<v Speaker 4>part of Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very,</v>

1830
01:31:30.331 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 4>very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about wolves?</v>

1831
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Have Wolves contracted it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wolves are interesting story.</v>

1832
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.030
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1833
01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 4>to date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that any Canaan,</v>

1834
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:44.850
<v Speaker 4>any member of the dog family has ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>developed any TSC.</v>

1835
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.040
<v Speaker 4>They never got bse as far as we know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1836
01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.640
<v Speaker 4>no evidence at any Canaan has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd.</v>

1837
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Now that could be a real observation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could also be that we haven't done</v>

1838
01:31:56.161 --> 01:31:57.750
<v Speaker 4>enough science on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1839
01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.640
<v Speaker 4>But there's certainly exposure as</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposed to cats.</v>

1840
01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the BSE situation,</v>

1841
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:07.630
<v Speaker 2>both great cats and domestic cats got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>TLC.</v>

1842
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:10.000
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was referred to as feline spongiform</v>

1843
01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 2>encephalopathy and it was from consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>BSE contaminated meat.</v>

1844
01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very similar to how he wasn't mountain</v>

1845
01:32:17.051 --> 01:32:17.660
<v Speaker 2>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Great cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which most certainly consumed.</v>

1847
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regular basis.</v>

1848
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Now in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in with cwt in North America,</v>

1849
01:32:24.011 --> 01:32:24.491
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1850
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:28.210
<v Speaker 2>we have no evidence at any mountain lion</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any great cat or small cat,</v>

1851
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:31.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has contracted cwd and facts.</v>

1852
01:32:31.331 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a research study in Wyoming that I</v>

1853
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:36.060
<v Speaker 2>was a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1854
01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:41.120
<v Speaker 2>it turned out that the highest source of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality for cwt positive deer was</v>

1855
01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 2>mountain line predation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so somebody is going,</v>

1856
01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.153
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aha.</v>

1857
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.370
<v Speaker 2>CWT doesn't always kill deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1858
01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 2>but it predisposes them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about that.</v>

1859
01:32:51.461 --> 01:32:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Progressive neurological degeneration</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about how mountain lions hunt.</v>

1860
01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:59.920
<v Speaker 2>They're ambush hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a deer and you're not quite</v>

1861
01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1862
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean this disease is developing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

1863
01:33:04.031 --> 01:33:06.550
<v Speaker 2>you're progressing progressive dementia.</v>

1864
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:10.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not at the point where we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanized,</v>

1865
01:33:10.031 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>which really are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very poor.</v>

1866
01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:17.010
<v Speaker 2>We can't see disease yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but disease is progressing and an ambush</v>

1867
01:33:17.381 --> 01:33:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Predator can leverage that and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of that.</v>

1868
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.730
<v Speaker 2>And that weakness in the prey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see the same thing in Colorado.</v>

1869
01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies have identified that cwt</v>

1870
01:33:26.861 --> 01:33:29.260
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your tend to get hit by cars more</v>

1871
01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:31.100
<v Speaker 2>often than cwt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Negative negativity.</v>

1872
01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:33.550
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very logical.</v>

1873
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:37.690
<v Speaker 2>So now let's extend that to two wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and asked the question,</v>

1874
01:33:37.691 --> 01:33:41.410
<v Speaker 2>could wolves be a management tool for</v>
<v Speaker 2>cwd?</v>

1875
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolves are present in northern</v>

1876
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know a lot of them over there,</v>

1877
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.600
<v Speaker 2>a lot of other locations and at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point wolves and cwd we'll meet.</v>

1878
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.520
<v Speaker 2>So there's been mathematical models</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed,</v>

1879
01:33:57.610 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of assumptions built in</v>

1880
01:33:59.921 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 2>those models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it leaves it as an open question.</v>

1881
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:07.351
<v Speaker 2>Could a large coursing Predator who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision and senses are much more acute</v>

1882
01:34:08.951 --> 01:34:09.784
<v Speaker 2>than ours.</v>

1883
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Could they take advantage of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease in earlier stages?</v>

1884
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And so when disease meets</v>
<v Speaker 2>geographically,</v>

1885
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Wolf's could wolves slow or maybe stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>the progression of disease because</v>

1886
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:28.060
<v Speaker 2>they're taking the weak and the sick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old still wouldn't stop the</v>

1887
01:34:28.061 --> 01:34:33.061
<v Speaker 2>excretion and it still wouldn't stop all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the bodily fluids and they could they</v>

1888
01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:37.030
<v Speaker 2>could they slow the spread or stop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread?</v>

1889
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Maybe could they reverse disease?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could likely take all the predators.</v>

1890
01:34:41.981 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 2>You could find wolves and mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dump them into Iowa county just</v>

1891
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:51.130
<v Speaker 2>south of where Doug lives and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely would not be able to eliminate</v>

1892
01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:54.280
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at that [inaudible] has disease</v>

1893
01:34:54.281 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 2>spreads geographically at the interface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could predators</v>

1894
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 4>be an effective tool to slow or stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease from spreading?</v>

1895
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:07.810
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially when states are contemplating</v>

1896
01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.920
<v Speaker 4>more aggressive control measures opening</v>
<v Speaker 4>up hunting and trapping seasons to</v>

1897
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 4>reduce population densities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So woes.</v>

1898
01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:19.460
<v Speaker 4>So we don't have good tools and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave it an open question.</v>

1899
01:35:19.461 --> 01:35:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Do we want to take that potential tool</v>
<v Speaker 4>and take it out of the tool?</v>

1900
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.590
<v Speaker 4>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about,</v>

1901
01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1902
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:26.561
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1903
01:35:26.561 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Wolvercote well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyote by us,</v>

1904
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're eating deer die in our woods and</v>

1905
01:35:31.821 --> 01:35:32.654
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1906
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.020
<v Speaker 4>we found a dead one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1907
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 4>last time Steve was there and I was very</v>
<v Speaker 4>suspicious of it being a cw,</v>

1908
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:40.610
<v Speaker 4>cause it was a two and a half year old</v>
<v Speaker 4>buck.</v>

1909
01:35:40.611 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 4>It was laying there and it turns out it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably hit by a car,</v>

1910
01:35:43.761 --> 01:35:47.000
<v Speaker 4>but it was fairly well consumed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes by then.</v>

1911
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I cut the head off of it and sent it</v>

1912
01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:52.010
<v Speaker 4>in and it came back.</v>

1913
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Non-Positive um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens when that coyote,</v>

1914
01:35:56.481 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 4>which is going to travel while they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling huge distances,</v>

1915
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's eaten a cwd positive deer on the</v>

1916
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:07.400
<v Speaker 4>durian farm and he's running over to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunker hill seven or eight miles away</v>

1917
01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:11.230
<v Speaker 4>because they do that and he takes us to</v>
<v Speaker 4>dump over there.</v>

1918
01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done that.</v>

1919
01:36:12.291 --> 01:36:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Science has been done and so it turns</v>
<v Speaker 4>out if you take cwt,</v>

1920
01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 4>cwt positive material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put it in the front end of a coyote,</v>

1921
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 4>it comes out the backend of a coyote and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still capable.</v>

1922
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:27.050
<v Speaker 4>It's still infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They still infectivity and it is capable</v>

1923
01:36:27.051 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 4>of transmitting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said mice don't get it.</v>

1924
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.600
<v Speaker 4>A rats eat coyote poop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct?</v>

1925
01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:33.741
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1926
01:36:33.741 --> 01:36:34.720
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1927
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:37.430
<v Speaker 4>they don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that we're aware of.</v>

1928
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a potentially spread it and</v>

1929
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:41.690
<v Speaker 4>their urine because they would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>carrying it.</v>

1930
01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of,</v>

1931
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:47.060
<v Speaker 4>and I have to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you say he could eat cwd positive</v>

1932
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:50.000
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could poop it out x number of hours</v>

1933
01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 4>later and he might be a mile or two</v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

1934
01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a fairly local geographic</v>

1935
01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:58.400
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon that could be spreading</v>
<v Speaker 4>infectious material.</v>

1936
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.880
<v Speaker 4>Now you have to ask your self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1937
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 4>more questions when they defecate on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>

1938
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Is it dear likely to encounter and</v>
<v Speaker 4>consume that material?</v>

1939
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not now,</v>

1940
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:14.240
<v Speaker 4>but it might be fertilizer two years</v>
<v Speaker 4>down the road for plants if the deer</v>

1941
01:37:14.241 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 4>could eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1942
01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.300
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's just quite</v>
<v Speaker 4>restricted.</v>

1943
01:37:17.301 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 4>It's a localized geographic phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1944
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:23.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that we can do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell of a lot about.</v>

1945
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.530
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing with,</v>

1946
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:28.580
<v Speaker 4>with crows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put cwd in the front end of a</v>

1947
01:37:28.581 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 4>crow or probably other scavengers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd comes out the back end about four</v>

1948
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:35.660
<v Speaker 4>hours later she could ask her Christoph</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question,</v>

1949
01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 4>how far does it crow fly in for hours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is a deer likely to consume crow</v>

1950
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:44.591
<v Speaker 4>poop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these had been shown to be possible</v>

1951
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:50.410
<v Speaker 4>in a laboratory environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how much they really apply out in</v>

1952
01:37:50.721 --> 01:37:54.440
<v Speaker 4>the field is of Co of question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we go back,</v>

1953
01:37:54.441 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 4>we know that deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deer,</v>

1954
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:56.000
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

1955
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.641
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deer,</v>

1956
01:37:56.641 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>we see that slow diffusive process on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape.</v>

1957
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:04.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggie that's going on just</v>
<v Speaker 2>south of him and now his past him.</v>

1958
01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Then we have that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pathetic movement,</v>

1959
01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Yo humans moving long distances and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential for agricultural commodities</v>

1960
01:38:12.211 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 2>to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's likely other things like</v>

1961
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:20.130
<v Speaker 2>crows and coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a proof of concept in a laboratory,</v>

1962
01:38:20.131 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 2>but whether they're really happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the field as an isn't entirely open</v>

1963
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:25.170
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they are,</v>

1964
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>how big are they as compared to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other features?</v>

1965
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 3>So why not do the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1966
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:34.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1967
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 3>and some of the detractors will also</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1968
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:39.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't stop dear from doing dear</v>

1969
01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 3>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1970
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:44.610
<v Speaker 3>And branches licking each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1971
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:47.940
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1972
01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:52.470
<v Speaker 3>those normal dear activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we're concentrating them in an</v>

1973
01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:54.570
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say a mineral lick,</v>

1974
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:58.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where every deer in the area comes</v>

1975
01:38:58.881 --> 01:39:02.730
<v Speaker 3>through there and then looks at in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a feeder or a feeder,</v>

1976
01:39:03.190 --> 01:39:04.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1977
01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.420
<v Speaker 3>a bait pile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1978
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1979
01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:09.240
<v Speaker 3>and we've seen bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1980
01:39:09.241 --> 01:39:11.060
<v Speaker 3>I've seen bait piles where there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pile of corn.</v>

1981
01:39:11.061 --> 01:39:11.980
<v Speaker 3>It was a pile of apples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1982
01:39:11.981 --> 01:39:14.240
<v Speaker 3>they're all eating off the same pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got all these deer coming into</v>

1983
01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that we can do</v>

1984
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:20.640
<v Speaker 3>something about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are all these natural movements</v>

1985
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:24.300
<v Speaker 3>that we can't do anything about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we can slow the spread by</v>

1986
01:39:24.301 --> 01:39:28.530
<v Speaker 3>stopping these unnatural gatherings of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during these unnatural,</v>

1987
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading of the disease,</v>

1988
01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.860
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't we do that?</v>

1989
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few things.</v>

1990
01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:35.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep honing in on,</v>

1991
01:39:35.670 --> 01:39:38.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these anthropogenic factors and</v>

1992
01:39:38.371 --> 01:39:43.371
<v Speaker 2>then what can we do where disease is</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly his ear?</v>

1993
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:46.440
<v Speaker 2>The things you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baiting and feeding artificial</v>

1994
01:39:46.441 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 2>congregations of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1995
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in where TB is in,</v>

1996
01:39:51.991 --> 01:39:53.850
<v Speaker 2>in Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't bait and feed.</v>

1997
01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the other states where cewd is,</v>

1998
01:39:56.431 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 2>you can't bait and feed deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is you're artificially</v>

1999
01:40:00.091 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 2>congregating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remember that single deer,</v>

2000
01:40:02.731 --> 01:40:05.130
<v Speaker 2>we saw him up there on the screen is</v>
<v Speaker 2>shedding Mayo,</v>

2001
01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 2>copious amounts of saliva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that deer goes up to a pile of</v>

2002
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>corn on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's sharing spreading infectious agent</v>

2003
01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:15.690
<v Speaker 2>into that corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can persist on that corn for a long,</v>

2004
01:40:15.691 --> 01:40:17.070
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decades,</v>

2005
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:18.270
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naive,</v>

2006
01:40:18.271 --> 01:40:20.810
<v Speaker 2>susceptible animal comes up at each set</v>
<v Speaker 2>corner,</v>

2007
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 2>licks that mineral lick and it's likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that animal is ingesting viable</v>

2008
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 2>infectious agent can transmit disease.</v>

2009
01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2010
01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.791
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2011
01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>the analogy there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is his daycare.</v>

2012
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get your kid's sick,</v>

2013
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.780
<v Speaker 2>your three year old kids sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best place to do it?</v>

2014
01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Send them to send them to daycare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daycare is the analogy.</v>

2015
01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:48.120
<v Speaker 2>There is that pile of corn on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

2016
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:52.200
<v Speaker 2>So if every child that ever goes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>daycare is perfectly healthy,</v>

2017
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not little disease factories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that's not the case.</v>

2018
01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:00.580
<v Speaker 2>So they're in a great place in schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>are a great place to spread disease and</v>

2019
01:41:00.581 --> 01:41:03.550
<v Speaker 2>then those kids come home and share it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you and then you can share it with</v>

2020
01:41:03.551 --> 01:41:04.384
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2021
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Same thing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these artificial congregations,</v>

2022
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 2>if all the deer healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll then,</v>

2023
01:41:09.971 --> 01:41:12.190
<v Speaker 2>they can't be a place to transmit</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

2024
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.980
<v Speaker 2>but we know that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an iguana.</v>

2025
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Those risk factors we can control.</v>

2026
01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:18.380
<v Speaker 2>But now you hit doug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2027
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.790
<v Speaker 2>we get back to this area where disease</v>
<v Speaker 2>is established.</v>

2028
01:41:21.791 --> 01:41:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything we can do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly things we can try,</v>

2029
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we haven't,</v>

2030
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>we haven't exhausted the toolkit yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2031
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Mike Samuel at uws and I now retired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2032
01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.970
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looked at this from a mathematical</v>

2033
01:41:36.971 --> 01:41:41.440
<v Speaker 2>perspective and he's trying to leverage</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that adult males have higher</v>

2034
01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 2>prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2035
01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So there they are sync spur disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gathering disease and then</v>

2036
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 2>they're shedders of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2037
01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 2>So what if in our harvest regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in hunting season,</v>

2038
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:59.350
<v Speaker 2>we focused on adult males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2039
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:04.060
<v Speaker 2>we hammer the bucks because they're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones most likely to have disease.</v>

2040
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 2>So we would lower prevalence and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're reducing the proportion of the</v>

2041
01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 2>population with the highest prevalence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disease.</v>

2042
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:17.320
<v Speaker 2>The idea is if you knock that segment</v>
<v Speaker 2>down enough that you would interrupt</v>

2043
01:42:17.321 --> 01:42:22.321
<v Speaker 2>disease transmission cycles and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could actually lower herd prevalence</v>

2044
01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:23.650
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>

2045
01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Now you still have the persistence in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

2046
01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:29.800
<v Speaker 2>but on from a modeling basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

2047
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now think about the deer hunter out</v>

2048
01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:35.110
<v Speaker 2>there listening to me today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this show today.</v>

2049
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they want us to go out and kill all</v>

2050
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:42.571
<v Speaker 2>the bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not going to be a very desirable</v>

2051
01:42:42.671 --> 01:42:47.671
<v Speaker 2>from a hunter's perspective tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the tools we have,</v>

2052
01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you considered these like medicine for</v>
<v Speaker 2>bird disease.</v>

2053
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 2>They're very bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a bitter pill.</v>

2054
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2055
01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you were there when we were still doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wearing the Sombrero.</v>

2056
01:42:58.721 --> 01:42:59.554
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2057
01:42:59.850 --> 01:43:02.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot a smaller buck or whatever and uh,</v>

2058
01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a management idea that we wanted</v>

2059
01:43:05.381 --> 01:43:09.040
<v Speaker 2>to grow some bigger bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time we were pretty</v>

2060
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:10.810
<v Speaker 2>lenient about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2061
01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing that anymore.</v>

2062
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.850
<v Speaker 2>The deer I shot last year were deer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2063
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:16.360
<v Speaker 2>eight years ago.</v>

2064
01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even take another look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first bucket shot.</v>

2065
01:43:19.691 --> 01:43:21.960
<v Speaker 2>The first buck I had an ethical shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2066
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Or the I'm giving you more tags or give</v>
<v Speaker 2>housing.</v>

2067
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Know</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's resistance resistance in the</v>

2068
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:32.380
<v Speaker 2>hunting community to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2069
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 2>that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is unfortunate.</v>

2070
01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of those,</v>

2071
01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:39.550
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in my part of the county deer</v>

2072
01:43:39.551 --> 01:43:43.780
<v Speaker 2>advisory committee and we're giving more</v>
<v Speaker 2>doterra eggs or antlerless tags because</v>

2073
01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 2>the other part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2074
01:43:45.821 --> 01:43:46.660
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2075
01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:49.760
<v Speaker 2>a population in the box that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sinks as he said,</v>

2076
01:43:49.761 --> 01:43:51.760
<v Speaker 2>and they're spreading the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2077
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2078
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.620
<v Speaker 3>and they're traveling more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2079
01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.080
<v Speaker 3>a doe and her family tend to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in one area a little bit more where</v>

2080
01:43:57.081 --> 01:43:59.430
<v Speaker 3>the bucks have a bigger range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2081
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:01.530
<v Speaker 3>but the other thing is then is</v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

2082
01:44:01.531 --> 01:44:03.800
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of different reasons,</v>

2083
01:44:03.801 --> 01:44:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw the number of deer that we have</v>

2084
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:10.511
<v Speaker 3>in our place in richland county.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have in excess of 75 deer per square</v>

2085
01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:13.010
<v Speaker 3>mile of habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's places in the country</v>

2086
01:44:13.011 --> 01:44:14.990
<v Speaker 3>that are higher than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2087
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:16.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2088
01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:17.024
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a,</v>

2089
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.930
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big population and I'm,</v>

2090
01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I have issue with it for a few different</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

2091
01:44:22.911 --> 01:44:25.430
<v Speaker 3>One of them's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one is that when I have too</v>

2092
01:44:25.431 --> 01:44:27.770
<v Speaker 3>many deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my little oak trees are getting because</v>

2093
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 3>they love those little oak trees and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting chewed off and I'm</v>

2094
01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>trying to do multiple things.</v>

2095
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:34.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not just trying to raise deer on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>farm,</v>

2096
01:44:35.370 --> 01:44:36.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our woodlands.</v>

2097
01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2098
01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2099
01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.280
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this demographic issue that,</v>

2100
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2101
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Mike Samuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had been working on,</v>

2102
01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.960
<v Speaker 3>but then there's the population issue as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2103
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're given four.</v>

2104
01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:52.550
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid,</v>

2105
01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 3>when you bought up buck license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and four other dudes would get</v>

2106
01:44:56.931 --> 01:45:01.640
<v Speaker 3>together and then fill out this form and</v>
<v Speaker 3>send it in and like August to get a,</v>

2107
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:05.960
<v Speaker 3>what was called a party tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could shoot one doe between four</v>

2108
01:45:05.961 --> 01:45:08.840
<v Speaker 3>people because we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2109
01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:12.060
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to manage the herd to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have mortier.</v>

2110
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid seeing deer,</v>

2111
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 3>it was a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exact opposite now.</v>

2112
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:21.490
<v Speaker 3>So now you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a buck tag and you get for a</v>

2113
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.920
<v Speaker 3>antlerless tags with every tag that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy in our county.</v>

2114
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 3>What changed from when you were a kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the population exploded?</v>

2115
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2116
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:32.810
<v Speaker 3>management was a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2117
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:35.780
<v Speaker 3>and the management exploded is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2118
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be 60 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was an exotic and look.</v>

2119
01:45:38.781 --> 01:45:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2120
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

2121
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:44.900
<v Speaker 3>and Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look pretty good too.</v>

2122
01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good.</v>

2123
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Jamie on the other hand over that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's still a young buck,</v>

2124
01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 3>no kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2125
01:45:54.231 --> 01:45:55.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2126
01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.073
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2127
01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty long period of time.</v>

2128
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 3>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2129
01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.140
<v Speaker 3>when you're controlling because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have many deer and your managing</v>

2130
01:46:06.141 --> 01:46:10.140
<v Speaker 3>to increase the deer herd and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality out there that will,</v>

2131
01:46:10.141 --> 01:46:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to shoot a dope because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:46:11.691 --> 01:46:13.410
<v Speaker 3>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2133
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 3>and they're having to fonts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this year,</v>

2134
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.930
<v Speaker 3>at least in my area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing a lot of those having three</v>

2135
01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 3>fonts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2136
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:24.400
<v Speaker 3>you can see how that growth of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

2137
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:25.603
<v Speaker 3>the herd.</v>

2138
01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to hurt to grow,</v>

2139
01:46:27.411 --> 01:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>stop shooting dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to take a her down,</v>

2140
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:31.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot does,</v>

2141
01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna get back in Grad School in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illinois,</v>

2142
01:46:33.951 --> 01:46:36.920
<v Speaker 2>they gave away these little pins that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters collected.</v>

2143
01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>And when you brought a dough into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>registration station,</v>

2144
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:41.690
<v Speaker 2>you got a pin that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot a doe.</v>

2145
01:46:41.691 --> 01:46:43.750
<v Speaker 2>So the herd won't grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2146
01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.780
<v Speaker 2>people collected these little momentos</v>
<v Speaker 2>during that time frame.</v>

2147
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up,</v>

2148
01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:50.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale,</v>

2149
01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.940
<v Speaker 2>a couple counties to the north and west</v>
<v Speaker 2>of where Doug was in,</v>

2150
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:55.840
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 1960s.</v>

2151
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there weren't a lot of deer around there</v>

2152
01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 2>and watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2153
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:01.130
<v Speaker 2>as I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.950
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't shoot many dose.</v>

2155
01:47:02.951 --> 01:47:07.320
<v Speaker 2>The regulations in the state didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to shoot dose by 1980 on</v>

2156
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:10.920
<v Speaker 2>opening day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I counted 160 dear on opening</v>

2157
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.810
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years before that,</v>

2158
01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>probably saw three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2159
01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So exponential growth in the deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>population over that point in time.</v>

2160
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.780
<v Speaker 2>The deer management program worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

2161
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how to go out there.</v>

2162
01:47:23.131 --> 01:47:25.920
<v Speaker 2>And that along with all of that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've already talked about the</v>

2163
01:47:25.921 --> 01:47:30.921
<v Speaker 2>agriculture and the agriculture expanded</v>
<v Speaker 2>well agriculture but the uh,</v>

2164
01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:33.570
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always there so it had the</v>

2165
01:47:33.571 --> 01:47:37.430
<v Speaker 2>potential for all of the explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2166
01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:40.080
<v Speaker 2>so there's a interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2167
01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I talk with folks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the state of Michigan and they've got</v>

2168
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:43.740
<v Speaker 2>a shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2169
01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 2>pro relatively recent likely issue is</v>
<v Speaker 2>cwd and yeah,</v>

2170
01:47:48.301 --> 01:47:53.070
<v Speaker 2>there's user groups out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to advise the state on how to</v>

2171
01:47:53.071 --> 01:47:56.160
<v Speaker 2>manage cwd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the groups is,</v>

2172
01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.520
<v Speaker 2>is talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2173
01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it's called antler point restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2174
01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.610
<v Speaker 2>The idea is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2175
01:48:02.611 --> 01:48:06.660
<v Speaker 2>a yearling buck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 months old has fairly small antlers</v>

2176
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:11.780
<v Speaker 2>and then as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they typically get successively larger</v>

2177
01:48:12.031 --> 01:48:12.864
<v Speaker 2>antlers.</v>

2178
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.920
<v Speaker 2>So a group is out there right now as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>active proponent of implementing antler</v>

2179
01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:24.411
<v Speaker 2>point restrictions and promoting</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlerless harvest at the same time.</v>

2180
01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a disease management tool.</v>

2181
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.450
<v Speaker 2>So as we noted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2182
01:48:30.451 --> 01:48:35.451
<v Speaker 2>lowering the population that already how</v>
<v Speaker 2>cwd is beneficial in it.</v>

2183
01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 2>If we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have a herd of 500 animals with</v>

2184
01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:47.331
<v Speaker 2>10% prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 50 positives versus a herd of 20</v>

2185
01:48:47.341 --> 01:48:52.260
<v Speaker 2>animals with 5% which would be one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a dramatic difference.</v>

2186
01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.560
<v Speaker 2>The prevalence is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have fewer positives out there.</v>

2187
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lowering populations overall does</v>

2188
01:48:59.041 --> 01:49:01.740
<v Speaker 2>make sense with regard to disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2189
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>But now the other part of antler point</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions is allowing males to get</v>

2190
01:49:06.961 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they argue that that will keep</v>

2191
01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 2>hunters engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if hunters are engaged,</v>

2192
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 2>they'll shoot more dose and keep the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population down and that'll be a good</v>

2193
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:16.284
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2194
01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.860
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already discussed how adult males</v>

2195
01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:23.880
<v Speaker 2>have tend to have the highest prevalence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cwd.</v>

2196
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fair.</v>

2197
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Now you're talking about promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing more males into these older age</v>

2198
01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:34.140
<v Speaker 2>groups in an area where cwd has already</v>
<v Speaker 2>known to exist.</v>

2199
01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 2>And so from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a biological perspective,</v>

2200
01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.460
<v Speaker 2>from a numerical modeling perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

2201
01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I failed to see how this can work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2202
01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:50.810
<v Speaker 2>so will keep in hunter's engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sociological question that I</v>

2203
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 2>can't really address.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from a purely biological disease</v>

2204
01:49:56.021 --> 01:50:01.021
<v Speaker 2>driven process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting more older aged ma animals,</v>

2205
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:06.750
<v Speaker 2>older hd or in a population with cwd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot figure out how that could be</v>

2206
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>

2207
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 1>That seems the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that through this podcast,</v>

2208
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 1>this information becomes more digestible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that in order to get</v>

2209
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>what you just laid out over two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for someone to get that by</v>

2210
01:50:21.521 --> 01:50:23.380
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're not going to do it.</v>

2211
01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Most hunters are just not going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2212
01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling that like what Ted</v>

2213
01:50:29.201 --> 01:50:32.160
<v Speaker 1>nugent had said that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2214
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:36.640
<v Speaker 1>his perspective is possibly way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalent than should be.</v>

2215
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And because this information is not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>digestible,</v>

2216
01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:50:43.811 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you talked about it on meter</v>

2218
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:51.030
<v Speaker 1>episode 70 70 and then now today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to reach a lot more people</v>

2219
01:50:52.481 --> 01:50:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's in a very digestible form where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to sit down and listen to it.</v>

2220
01:50:56.350 --> 01:51:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully we can get the word out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in a way that it's not getting out</v>

2221
01:51:01.001 --> 01:51:03.100
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people understand the consequences of</v>

2222
01:51:03.101 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a real issue.</v>

2223
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not simply like,</v>

2224
01:51:06.370 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to do this because this</v>

2225
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:10.390
<v Speaker 1>could negatively impact our hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

2226
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:13.660
<v Speaker 1>We might not have any hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities in 10 years or 20 years</v>

2227
01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.020
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This literally could devastate the</v>

2228
01:51:17.021 --> 01:51:19.390
<v Speaker 1>entire population of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>

2229
01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not a simple thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredibly complex thing with</v>

2230
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:28.441
<v Speaker 1>a terrible disease that is 100% fatal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is absolutely spreading.</v>

2231
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 2>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the,</v>

2232
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the take home points,</v>

2233
01:51:33.341 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I always thinking and I get regularly</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked by hunters,</v>

2234
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:36.820
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>

2235
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what a hunter's do.</v>

2236
01:51:38.501 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 2>They sit at deer camp and they shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crap around,</v>

2237
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever libations or whatever.</v>

2238
01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to talk about things</v>

2239
01:51:46.211 --> 01:51:50.170
<v Speaker 2>like cwd and good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let those conver conversations be</v>

2240
01:51:50.171 --> 01:51:54.010
<v Speaker 2>driven by fact and science as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rumor and Innuendo.</v>

2241
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2242
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:57.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing here to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think this public</v>

2243
01:51:57.221 --> 01:51:59.530
<v Speaker 2>information is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so important.</v>

2244
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:03.580
<v Speaker 2>There's other things it can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked to doug hit on a bunch of</v>

2245
01:52:03.581 --> 01:52:04.414
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2246
01:52:04.450 --> 01:52:07.300
<v Speaker 2>hunting as part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting a healthy deer herd.</v>

2247
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Can't haunting keep populations low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Test your deer and manage those</v>

2248
01:52:13.631 --> 01:52:16.120
<v Speaker 2>carcasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't leave them out on the landscape.</v>

2249
01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:19.690
<v Speaker 2>There's another category though of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things it can be done.</v>

2250
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in deer camp,</v>

2251
01:52:21.221 --> 01:52:24.670
<v Speaker 2>what's the easiest thing to do is blame</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dnr for everything.</v>

2252
01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.680
<v Speaker 2>The Department of natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2253
01:52:26.681 --> 01:52:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2254
01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:31.330
<v Speaker 2>it's almost a sport to kick around at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and see who can insult the dnr the</v>

2255
01:52:31.331 --> 01:52:32.164
<v Speaker 2>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2256
01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:35.950
<v Speaker 2>So it was regard to disease though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that really an effective use of your</v>

2257
01:52:35.951 --> 01:52:37.240
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be fun,</v>

2258
01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:41.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's likely not affected because</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of the state management agencies</v>

2259
01:52:41.861 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>that deal with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be the Agriculture Department</v>

2260
01:52:44.501 --> 01:52:47.720
<v Speaker 2>or the natural department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very,</v>

2261
01:52:47.721 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 2>very restricted in what they can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>there within a legislator.</v>

2262
01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Operate within a legislative framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2263
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:58.640
<v Speaker 2>So if you really want to impact change</v>
<v Speaker 2>in how a government agency goes about</v>

2264
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:02.060
<v Speaker 2>its business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you talk to the local biologist</v>

2265
01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:06.710
<v Speaker 2>or should you talk to the elected leader</v>
<v Speaker 2>who establishes the legislative</v>

2266
01:53:06.711 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 2>framework that that agency works</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath?</v>

2267
01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.800
<v Speaker 3>It's important to put pressure on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2268
01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 3>on our elected representatives and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've seen change in that in well,</v>

2269
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin being a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2270
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.680
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2271
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:25.460
<v Speaker 3>management used to be science based</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife biologists making decisions</v>

2272
01:53:25.461 --> 01:53:28.040
<v Speaker 3>about deer management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's politically based.</v>

2273
01:53:28.041 --> 01:53:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Now politicians are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are deciding what the,</v>

2274
01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.460
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll often hear that in uh,</v>

2275
01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:36.560
<v Speaker 3>I will county Wisconsin where this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this first effort started.</v>

2276
01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well see it didn't work up.</v>

2277
01:53:38.481 --> 01:53:39.291
<v Speaker 3>Their dnr is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2278
01:53:39.291 --> 01:53:41.900
<v Speaker 3>they had this idea and it didn't work to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop the disease.</v>

2279
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 3>It didn't get a chance to work because</v>

2280
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.000
<v Speaker 2>social and political pressures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>political stars forced the dnr to vacate</v>

2281
01:53:50.251 --> 01:53:52.320
<v Speaker 2>their plants and their aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures.</v>

2282
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And even more recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a,</v>

2283
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:55.830
<v Speaker 2>but it was a court case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2284
01:53:55.831 --> 01:53:58.710
<v Speaker 2>the state of Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Missouri Department of Conservation</v>

2285
01:53:58.711 --> 01:54:02.520
<v Speaker 2>tried to implement some restrictions on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the captive serving industry to stop</v>

2286
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:06.750
<v Speaker 2>importation of live deer seeing them as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a risk factor.</v>

2287
01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deer breeders sued the state,</v>

2288
01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through the court system and,</v>

2289
01:54:13.681 --> 01:54:16.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was decided by the Supreme Court in</v>

2290
01:54:16.981 --> 01:54:18.840
<v Speaker 2>the state of Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2291
01:54:18.841 --> 01:54:23.841
<v Speaker 2>about three weeks ago that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all dear are,</v>

2292
01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:26.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reps or represent wild deer and that the</v>

2293
01:54:26.731 --> 01:54:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Department of conservation was well</v>
<v Speaker 2>within their constitutional and</v>

2294
01:54:30.751 --> 01:54:35.751
<v Speaker 2>legislative authority to implement</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures designed to protect the</v>

2295
01:54:36.121 --> 01:54:39.990
<v Speaker 2>integrity and viability of that deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>herd for future generations.</v>

2296
01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:42.120
<v Speaker 2>So the Supreme Court said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2297
01:54:42.121 --> 01:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Department of Conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do have the right to restrict import</v>

2298
01:54:45.991 --> 01:54:50.430
<v Speaker 2>of animals into captive serve facilities</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the integrity of the herd.</v>

2299
01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2300
01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>the legislative part of it is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important and I can't put too fine a</v>

2301
01:54:56.371 --> 01:54:57.900
<v Speaker 3>point on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2302
01:54:58.110 --> 01:55:02.970
<v Speaker 3>laws can be changed and there's pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that under lot of for you know,</v>

2303
01:55:02.971 --> 01:55:04.950
<v Speaker 3>a lot of different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a part of changing some</v>

2304
01:55:04.951 --> 01:55:09.300
<v Speaker 3>legislation it had to do with forestry</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know how it's done.</v>

2305
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2306
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:18.690
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite quotes from Ella</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leopold is ethical behavior is doing the</v>

2307
01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:23.700
<v Speaker 3>right thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>even when no one's watching.</v>

2308
01:55:23.970 --> 01:55:28.440
<v Speaker 3>And the wrong thing is legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just because it's legal doesn't mean</v>

2309
01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:31.140
<v Speaker 3>it's the right thing to do and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean it's the ethical thing to</v>

2310
01:55:31.141 --> 01:55:33.700
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any potential to changing the,</v>

2311
01:55:33.701 --> 01:55:38.280
<v Speaker 3>the limits tag limits or making them</v>
<v Speaker 3>more widespread if they understand the</v>

2312
01:55:38.281 --> 01:55:41.070
<v Speaker 3>issue with this and they understand that</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the main tools of,</v>

2313
01:55:41.071 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 3>of handling this in a more manner and</v>

2314
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 1>slowing the populate or slowing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread of this disease,</v>

2315
01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:49.770
<v Speaker 1>who the population at deer is reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population itself.</v>

2316
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It mean even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2317
01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 1>these hunters would resist this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would limit hunting opportunities.</v>

2318
01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:01.820
<v Speaker 1>This could potentially be a large tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the toolbox of conservation and</v>

2319
01:56:02.671 --> 01:56:05.760
<v Speaker 1>stopping the spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Short answer on that is yes.</v>

2320
01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the county deer advisory</v>

2321
01:56:07.531 --> 01:56:10.470
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the opportunity to give out as</v>

2322
01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:13.200
<v Speaker 1>many tags as antlerless tags is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want,</v>

2323
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.220
<v Speaker 1>what about Antler tags?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's the issue,</v>

2324
01:56:15.221 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that's it.</v>

2325
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:21.561
<v Speaker 1>One per person is legislatively control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even with this disease,</v>

2326
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:24.790
<v Speaker 1>which that might be the number one tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2327
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:26.310
<v Speaker 1>to slow down the spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2328
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:30.610
<v Speaker 3>We used to have a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a policy in uh,</v>

2329
01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin called earn and buck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was not particularly,</v>

2330
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:38.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2331
01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:41.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular with a lot of hunters.</v>

2332
01:56:41.831 --> 01:56:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to shoot my book and I don't want</v>

2333
01:56:43.931 --> 01:56:45.010
<v Speaker 3>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot earn a buck.</v>

2334
01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:48.550
<v Speaker 3>He had to shoot a doe a last year to</v>
<v Speaker 3>earn a buck tag.</v>

2335
01:56:49.210 --> 01:56:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't particularly popular.</v>

2336
01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:55.790
<v Speaker 3>That's really a mild way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2337
01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Well it was a post [inaudible] opposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a very noisy group of hunters.</v>

2338
01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2339
01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.180
<v Speaker 3>with my experience with working with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislature,</v>

2340
01:57:07.181 --> 01:57:11.260
<v Speaker 3>a small group of people making a hell of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of noise with a certain amount of</v>

2341
01:57:11.261 --> 01:57:14.500
<v Speaker 3>money can change things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't popular.</v>

2342
01:57:14.501 --> 01:57:16.660
<v Speaker 3>It was popular with me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2343
01:57:16.661 --> 01:57:18.610
<v Speaker 3>you hunted on my farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2344
01:57:19.150 --> 01:57:22.000
<v Speaker 3>we shoot way more antler of a steer that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shoot bucks.</v>

2345
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when earn a buck was in place,</v>

2346
01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:30.960
<v Speaker 3>we'd have a stack of buck takes because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were shooting so many dose.</v>

2347
01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:34.600
<v Speaker 3>That was because it was politically or</v>
<v Speaker 3>socially,</v>

2348
01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became a political issue.</v>

2349
01:57:37.930 --> 01:57:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was rescinded.</v>

2350
01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And so now what we found in Richland</v>
<v Speaker 3>county is we can give,</v>

2351
01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:49.090
<v Speaker 3>we could drop antlerless tags from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopter to shoot as many as you want</v>

2352
01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:53.290
<v Speaker 3>and we're still gonna kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the same number of those about the</v>

2353
01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:54.190
<v Speaker 3>same number of dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

2354
01:57:54.191 --> 01:57:55.960
<v Speaker 3>there was a little bit and there's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of an uptick.</v>

2355
01:57:55.961 --> 01:57:58.660
<v Speaker 3>But when we had earned a buck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we killed a shitload of them,</v>

2356
01:57:58.990 --> 01:58:00.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times as many.</v>

2357
01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.850
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2358
01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.150
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand,</v>

2359
01:58:07.151 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 3>especially like casual hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2360
01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:10.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gun hunters are a good example.</v>

2361
01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Bowhunters or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different example because they're not as</v>

2362
01:58:14.021 --> 01:58:15.880
<v Speaker 3>casual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're more interested in,</v>

2363
01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:16.480
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2364
01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.900
<v Speaker 3>killing the big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big buck a generally,</v>

2365
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:22.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2366
01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:24.460
<v Speaker 3>gone hunters.</v>

2367
01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go out there for two or three days.</v>

2368
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:27.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were there and we froze our asses</v>

2369
01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:28.460
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2370
01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:28.931
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2371
01:58:28.931 --> 01:58:32.380
<v Speaker 3>how long am I going to stay out here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a really short season.</v>

2372
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.890
<v Speaker 3>We initially had much longer season</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2373
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:39.200
<v Speaker 3>when the cwd management first started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had a much longer season.</v>

2374
01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2375
01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to hunt with folks that,</v>

2376
01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2377
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:46.870
<v Speaker 3>that maybe had their own place to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I invited folks from the community</v>

2378
01:58:46.871 --> 01:58:48.030
<v Speaker 3>to come in and hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2379
01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends from different places came down</v>

2380
01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:51.700
<v Speaker 3>and hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

2381
01:58:53.370 --> 01:58:55.850
<v Speaker 3>a small noisy group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2382
01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smallest,</v>

2383
01:58:57.190 --> 01:58:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the numbers are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2384
01:58:58.510 --> 01:58:59.800
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2385
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:04.350
<v Speaker 3>made that go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we're back down to the 90 season.</v>

2386
01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who,</v>

2387
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:08.740
<v Speaker 3>who gave into that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The politicians,</v>

2388
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:10.630
<v Speaker 3>politicians understand</v>

2389
01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:14.070
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing it from an ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from point of ignorance,</v>

2390
01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.290
<v Speaker 2>political pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political pressure.</v>

2391
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I've got to hope that something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this podcast gets to them.</v>

2392
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I sure hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2393
01:59:20.971 --> 01:59:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure why we came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a terrifying couple.</v>

2394
01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Couple of Erica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Wisconsin experience was really</v>

2395
01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:31.920
<v Speaker 2>important and the data shows that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first couple of years,</v>

2396
01:59:31.921 --> 01:59:36.921
<v Speaker 2>so they say aggressive management with</v>
<v Speaker 2>earn a buck was actually forcing the</v>

2397
01:59:37.561 --> 01:59:41.100
<v Speaker 2>population down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was very unpopular.</v>

2398
01:59:41.130 --> 01:59:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2399
01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:47.670
<v Speaker 2>political pressure was applied and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>tool was taken out of the toolbox thrown</v>

2400
01:59:47.671 --> 01:59:49.890
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Immediately.</v>

2401
01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:52.610
<v Speaker 2>When you stop doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2402
01:59:52.650 --> 01:59:55.680
<v Speaker 2>earn a buck and you stopped having</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer seasons,</v>

2403
01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:59.340
<v Speaker 2>the population trends reversed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>started going back up.</v>

2404
01:59:59.670 --> 02:00:01.800
<v Speaker 2>So it was easy to label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2405
02:00:01.801 --> 02:00:06.180
<v Speaker 2>the dnr failed their effort to eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease by,</v>

2406
02:00:06.450 --> 02:00:09.630
<v Speaker 2>by having aggressive seasons failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Doug said,</v>

2407
02:00:09.631 --> 02:00:11.760
<v Speaker 2>we don't know that because we stopped.</v>

2408
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>We pulled the plug on the tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alberta,</v>

2409
02:00:15.090 --> 02:00:18.930
<v Speaker 2>when the wind cwd started really</v>
<v Speaker 2>blossoming in Saskatchewan,</v>

2410
02:00:18.931 --> 02:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Alberta was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want it.</v>

2411
02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>And they found their first handful of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases right on the border between</v>

2412
02:00:24.001 --> 02:00:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Alberta and Saskatchewan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took,</v>

2413
02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:31.440
<v Speaker 2>they raise the odds a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started harvesting deer from an</v>

2414
02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:34.760
<v Speaker 2>aerial platform called a helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2415
02:00:35.190 --> 02:00:40.190
<v Speaker 2>That helicopter with government agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp shooting deer to try and basically</v>

2416
02:00:41.251 --> 02:00:45.420
<v Speaker 2>eliminate deer in a buffer zone between</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saskatchewan and Alberta,</v>

2417
02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:49.110
<v Speaker 2>knock the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer out and create a buffer zone where</v>

2418
02:00:49.111 --> 02:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>disease wasn't well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was not very popular either.</v>

2419
02:00:52.951 --> 02:00:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a Fart in church and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>land owners and outfitters went to the</v>

2420
02:00:57.001 --> 02:00:59.430
<v Speaker 2>ministry and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't possibly have this.</v>

2421
02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And that program I had every chance of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being successful and the rug was pulled</v>

2422
02:01:05.341 --> 02:01:07.140
<v Speaker 2>out from underneath them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2423
02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:09.270
<v Speaker 2>So now here we have time.</v>

2424
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:10.141
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

2425
02:01:10.141 --> 02:01:11.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2426
02:01:11.071 --> 02:01:14.590
<v Speaker 2>years later and the western states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2427
02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>

2428
02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where disease has been a long time.</v>

2429
02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Their wildlife health professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have put together a set of uniform</v>

2430
02:01:24.031 --> 02:01:29.031
<v Speaker 2>management recommendations for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>western states came and they're</v>

2431
02:01:29.521 --> 02:01:31.920
<v Speaker 2>promoting the things that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

2432
02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>reducing those artificial congregations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of animals,</v>

2433
02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>implementing a harvest structure to</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus males.</v>

2434
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The male focused the most,</v>

2435
02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>the social group with the highest</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence and also kind of what I guess</v>

2436
02:01:48.051 --> 02:01:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I would refer to as hotspot shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see a new spark of disease out</v>

2437
02:01:52.191 --> 02:01:54.440
<v Speaker 2>there on the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on it.</v>

2438
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't allow it to become established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your only chance to be successful to</v>

2439
02:01:58.161 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>eliminate disease is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very soon before it gets established.</v>

2440
02:02:02.061 --> 02:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>And Starch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2441
02:02:03.081 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 2>spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're seeing in Wyoming and</v>

2442
02:02:06.141 --> 02:02:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Colorado and Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actively talking,</v>

2443
02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to the media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to their commissions and</v>

2444
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:16.100
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about implementing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulatory structures at least on an</v>

2445
02:02:16.101 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 2>experimental basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that doing nothing</v>

2446
02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:23.480
<v Speaker 3>is no longer an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that was</v>

2447
02:02:23.481 --> 02:02:26.720
<v Speaker 3>learned from the Wisconsin experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word.</v>

2448
02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are our failure.</v>

2449
02:02:29.851 --> 02:02:30.621
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2450
02:02:30.621 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 3>the analogy that I often use is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2451
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:35.300
<v Speaker 3>we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had this car and it was,</v>

2452
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty decent car.</v>

2453
02:02:36.381 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty decent model of how we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to control the disease.</v>

2454
02:02:39.710 --> 02:02:41.990
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of let the oil go out of the</v>

2455
02:02:41.991 --> 02:02:45.260
<v Speaker 3>car and they ran it into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rented in the ditch and banged it around</v>

2456
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:46.370
<v Speaker 3>and then brought it up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

2457
02:02:46.371 --> 02:02:51.371
<v Speaker 3>this Ford doesn't run worth a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't actively tried to</v>

2458
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:54.470
<v Speaker 3>defeat something and then say it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

2459
02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:56.510
<v Speaker 3>you really have to let it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2460
02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:59.060
<v Speaker 3>this is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in Whiskey,</v>

2461
02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:04.720
<v Speaker 3>what I hope that what's happening and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I can see is in,</v>

2462
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 15 years that I've learned about</v>

2463
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 3>cwd is that not only is there a lot been</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned about the disease,</v>

2464
02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:15.710
<v Speaker 3>but there's been a lot learned about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to manage it both on a scientific level</v>

2465
02:03:15.711 --> 02:03:17.330
<v Speaker 3>but on a social level as well.</v>

2466
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:19.370
<v Speaker 3>And I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2467
02:03:19.371 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want it.</v>

2468
02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2469
02:03:22.551 --> 02:03:26.900
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much more known now than</v>

2470
02:03:26.901 --> 02:03:28.970
<v Speaker 3>there was 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2471
02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we,</v>

2472
02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:33.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not too late in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2473
02:03:33.111 --> 02:03:35.960
<v Speaker 3>we can keep slowing it down and we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect the rest of the state.</v>

2474
02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:37.130
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2475
02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:40.370
<v Speaker 3>we get a lot of work to do and it takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a well,</v>

2476
02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.540
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really doesn't take the medicine</v>

2477
02:03:42.541 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 3>was very bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think technical information to,</v>

2478
02:03:44.931 --> 02:03:47.960
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think people are really</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of the extent of this disease or</v>

2479
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:50.720
<v Speaker 3>the danger of it or all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications of it.</v>

2480
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2481
02:03:51.711 --> 02:03:56.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised in my area intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I know that are casual</v>

2482
02:03:57.831 --> 02:03:59.270
<v Speaker 3>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2483
02:03:59.330 --> 02:04:02.660
<v Speaker 3>So it's getting to be deer hunting time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll talk to them what I'm like,</v>

2484
02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really,</v>

2485
02:04:04.011 --> 02:04:04.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2486
02:04:04.431 --> 02:04:05.930
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

2487
02:04:06.250 --> 02:04:07.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2488
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:10.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that really is one of the things.</v>

2489
02:04:10.191 --> 02:04:10.970
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2490
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:13.740
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate so much the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out here and talk about it.</v>

2491
02:04:13.741 --> 02:04:16.300
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Brian and Mike Samuel,</v>

2492
02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to come to a regional center</v>

2493
02:04:19.190 --> 02:04:24.190
<v Speaker 3>in September,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the capital or a county seat,</v>

2494
02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Richland County.</v>

2495
02:04:26.661 --> 02:04:27.470
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2496
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2497
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.020
<v Speaker 3>presentation on chronic wasting disease</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're advertising it.</v>

2498
02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2499
02:04:33.891 --> 02:04:37.180
<v Speaker 3>widely and more of that information has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get an education,</v>

2500
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.730
<v Speaker 3>a big part of Joel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're exactly right.</v>

2501
02:04:39.630 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just don't think there's enough</v>

2502
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:46.790
<v Speaker 4>digestible education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think this sort of form is one of</v>

2503
02:04:47.311 --> 02:04:48.820
<v Speaker 4>the most digestible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2504
02:04:48.821 --> 02:04:51.070
<v Speaker 4>you have to do is you put it on your car</v>
<v Speaker 4>and drive around,</v>

2505
02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 4>you listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put it in your headphones and you're</v>

2506
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:54.480
<v Speaker 4>at the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get this information,</v>

2507
02:04:54.481 --> 02:04:58.080
<v Speaker 4>you'll get an a and M in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably not going to sit down</v>

2508
02:04:58.081 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 4>and go through these studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I appreciate it as well.</v>

2509
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty,</v>

2510
02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not very savvy on social media and</v>

2511
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:08.760
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even sure what a podcast was</v>

2512
02:05:08.770 --> 02:05:13.170
<v Speaker 4>when Steven Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you asked me to come on and do meat</v>

2513
02:05:13.171 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 4>eater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we did that.</v>

2514
02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.800
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2515
02:05:18.150 --> 02:05:22.200
<v Speaker 4>I understand now it's been downloaded</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 650,000 times.</v>

2516
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which for a scientist,</v>

2517
02:05:24.991 --> 02:05:27.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been an author on a lot of peer</v>

2518
02:05:27.271 --> 02:05:29.910
<v Speaker 4>reviewed papers and I can guarantee you</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't been read.</v>

2519
02:05:30.210 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 4>You take a couple zeros off of there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably the readership on those</v>

2520
02:05:34.261 --> 02:05:36.120
<v Speaker 4>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from an impact,</v>

2521
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:38.100
<v Speaker 4>being able to get a message out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2522
02:05:38.370 --> 02:05:41.070
<v Speaker 4>this type forum really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really is helpful.</v>

2523
02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.330
<v Speaker 4>And getting it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you say,</v>

2524
02:05:42.331 --> 02:05:46.170
<v Speaker 4>down to a level that hunters can</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand and digestible I think is</v>

2525
02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.310
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very important.</v>

2526
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I w o he talked about how</v>

2527
02:05:49.921 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 4>misinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>active misinformation to try and,</v>

2528
02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:55.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not so bad or look over here,</v>

2529
02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:57.390
<v Speaker 4>don't look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look over there.</v>

2530
02:05:57.450 --> 02:05:59.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these diversionary tactics are very,</v>

2531
02:05:59.431 --> 02:06:03.090
<v Speaker 4>very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were very successful with tobacco.</v>

2532
02:06:03.091 --> 02:06:06.030
<v Speaker 4>They were successful with other</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific endeavors,</v>

2533
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:08.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>today and also the simplistic</v>

2534
02:06:08.011 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 4>perspective that hey look how many deer</v>
<v Speaker 4>get killed by winter.</v>

2535
02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way more than cwd stop,</v>

2536
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.380
<v Speaker 4>stop crying wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2537
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 4>So diversionary tactic,</v>

2538
02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to bring up about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2539
02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:25.720
<v Speaker 3>I've killed some big deer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2540
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Guys want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want it.</v>

2541
02:06:27.891 --> 02:06:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Hunters want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to kill.</v>

2542
02:06:29.530 --> 02:06:32.080
<v Speaker 4>That's what they look forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look forward to hunting season.</v>

2543
02:06:32.081 --> 02:06:33.280
<v Speaker 4>It's only one time a year.</v>

2544
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you get to do that as we're not just</v>

2545
02:06:36.701 --> 02:06:38.010
<v Speaker 3>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're conservationists.</v>

2546
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 3>What we do is going to affect the future</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have an obligation to do what's</v>

2547
02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:44.580
<v Speaker 3>best for the resource and what's best</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the future.</v>

2548
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:46.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you this,</v>

2549
02:06:47.010 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 3>last year I shot a two and a half year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old buck opening day.</v>

2550
02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:51.083
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2551
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>this is a nice little eight pointer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I celebrated that deer.</v>

2552
02:06:56.490 --> 02:07:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed that year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that moment just as much as</v>

2553
02:07:00.061 --> 02:07:03.450
<v Speaker 3>the 200 inch block that I killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2554
02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:09.020
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it concerns me that at times we get</v>

2555
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 3>so wrapped up and I was one of a man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a recovered alcoholic</v>

2556
02:07:15.751 --> 02:07:17.790
<v Speaker 3>sometimes about the whole aler thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2557
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:18.571
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

2558
02:07:18.571 --> 02:07:21.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm doug and I used to be a and step</v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

2559
02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:22.531
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>

2560
02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:23.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a part of that.</v>

2561
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But remember what the joy of hunting is</v>

2562
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2563
02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason for it and how important it</v>

2564
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:39.070
<v Speaker 3>is to make sure that that continues into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

2565
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been some folks who really,</v>

2566
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sounded huge alarms about this and you</v>

2567
02:07:44.621 --> 02:07:45.760
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked about it a little bit.</v>

2568
02:07:45.761 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years from now,</v>

2569
02:07:46.751 --> 02:07:47.171
<v Speaker 3>it could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2570
02:07:47.171 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 3>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it might take a generation or two,</v>

2571
02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but it really could become that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2572
02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to eat the meat and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know that in future generations,</v>

2573
02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years from now and that farm</v>

2574
02:07:58.241 --> 02:07:59.950
<v Speaker 3>is still there and it's still in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>during name,</v>

2575
02:07:59.951 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 3>it's been in my family for 115 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know that a hundred years from</v>

2576
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:07.510
<v Speaker 3>now that my descendants and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and their family are going to be</v>

2577
02:08:07.511 --> 02:08:12.010
<v Speaker 3>able to come there and still enjoy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in order for that to happen,</v>

2578
02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:15.880
<v Speaker 3>just like when I'm managing my oak trees</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that a hundred years from now there's</v>

2579
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:18.910
<v Speaker 3>going to be those big Oak Tree Sarah</v>
<v Speaker 3>again a hundred years from now,</v>

2580
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:23.410
<v Speaker 3>we have to do what we need to do now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order for this</v>

2581
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be there for the future.</v>

2582
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Our hunting heritage is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention that the financially,</v>

2583
02:08:31.050 --> 02:08:35.230
<v Speaker 4>that the economics of of deer hunting in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a place like Wisconsin,</v>

2584
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:38.530
<v Speaker 4>there's over 650,000 people that hunt</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer.</v>

2585
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:43.950
<v Speaker 4>They pump in excess of $1 billion every</v>
<v Speaker 4>year into the economy of the state of</v>

2586
02:08:43.991 --> 02:08:48.130
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin surrounded by hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we put that on a national basis,</v>

2587
02:08:48.131 --> 02:08:52.030
<v Speaker 4>there's millions of hunters and more</v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars spent.</v>

2588
02:08:52.031 --> 02:08:56.320
<v Speaker 4>So it's not a small thing when you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2589
02:08:56.370 --> 02:08:57.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the economics of hunting.</v>

2590
02:08:57.791 --> 02:09:00.520
<v Speaker 4>But the heritage of hunting is very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very important.</v>

2591
02:09:00.521 --> 02:09:00.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2592
02:09:00.970 --> 02:09:02.840
<v Speaker 4>I've been hunting my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2593
02:09:03.210 --> 02:09:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I hunt.</v>

2594
02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>primarily one county was to him and you</v>

2595
02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.490
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd has coming.</v>

2596
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I'd say I'm sitting in my tree stands</v>
<v Speaker 4>three years ago and Cwt is in the next</v>

2597
02:09:13.901 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 4>county.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over two years ago,</v>

2598
02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:19.300
<v Speaker 4>the first cwt positive deer in Crawford</v>
<v Speaker 4>County,</v>

2599
02:09:19.301 --> 02:09:21.730
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin was detected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2600
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:25.540
<v Speaker 4>less than two miles to the southwest of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tree that I'm sitting in.</v>

2601
02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Last year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cwd had been detected in another,</v>

2602
02:09:29.681 --> 02:09:31.930
<v Speaker 4>in a secondary in Crawford County.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This time,</v>

2603
02:09:31.931 --> 02:09:34.930
<v Speaker 4>one mile to the northeast of where my</v>
<v Speaker 4>tree stand is.</v>

2604
02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 4>I find myself looking at deer</v>
<v Speaker 4>differently.</v>

2605
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking for those subtle queues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a disease,</v>

2606
02:09:42.311 --> 02:09:46.230
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say it's changing the experience I</v>

2607
02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:48.250
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get calls pretty regularly from,</v>

2608
02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.220
<v Speaker 4>from hunters who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2609
02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.190
<v Speaker 4>really it's a coin flip out there.</v>

2610
02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure I want to hunt there</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore or no,</v>

2611
02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>because I'm on the deer advisory</v>
<v Speaker 3>committee.</v>

2612
02:10:01.770 --> 02:10:04.590
<v Speaker 3>A group of hunters came in who bought</v>
<v Speaker 3>land south of us,</v>

2613
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:05.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2614
02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.170
<v Speaker 3>20 miles south of us in a significant</v>
<v Speaker 3>portion and they're doing,</v>

2615
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

2616
02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:12.540
<v Speaker 3>they bought it to manage it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for bigger box,</v>

2617
02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:15.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and population and all of that.</v>

2618
02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:20.960
<v Speaker 3>They came into the county deer advisory</v>
<v Speaker 3>committee and talk to us about what</v>

2619
02:10:21.121 --> 02:10:24.840
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shot 43 deer on that property last</v>

2620
02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:27.810
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of the box tested,</v>

2621
02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>all the antler bucks tested positive for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cwd,</v>

2622
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 25%</v>

2623
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:39.310
<v Speaker 2>of the dose and some of the Fonz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a doe fawn who as cw who has cwd and</v>

2624
02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:44.300
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be clinical and die in</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>

2625
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:45.560
<v Speaker 2>she's never going to have funds of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

2626
02:10:45.561 --> 02:10:48.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the population issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I,</v>

2627
02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:50.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope those guys are listening.</v>

2628
02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I plotted about them is what</v>

2629
02:10:54.201 --> 02:10:58.850
<v Speaker 2>they've done is really worked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing in other people and I'm going</v>

2630
02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:00.680
<v Speaker 2>to do the same on our place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2631
02:11:00.740 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 2>bringing in more people to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2632
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:06.770
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take more deer and to do what they</v>

2633
02:11:06.771 --> 02:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>can manage it because they saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

2634
02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:11.270
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not seeing big old bucks anymore</v>

2635
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:13.160
<v Speaker 2>cause they're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're dying,</v>

2636
02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 2>they're finding them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're finding them dead.</v>

2637
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:20.540
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that in and a Wyoming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what we look at,</v>

2638
02:11:20.541 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 2>the longterm impacts had disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I talked a little bit about</v>

2639
02:11:23.301 --> 02:11:25.970
<v Speaker 2>population impacts driving population</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2640
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:30.230
<v Speaker 2>The other you're saying we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>identify is changes in that demographic</v>

2641
02:11:30.231 --> 02:11:33.790
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2642
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:36.470
<v Speaker 2>when you were hunting for the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlered deer,</v>

2643
02:11:36.471 --> 02:11:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for animals that are four</v>
<v Speaker 2>or five years old and mature over mature</v>

2644
02:11:40.971 --> 02:11:45.971
<v Speaker 2>animals in an area where cwt as</v>
<v Speaker 2>established at high prevalence levels,</v>

2645
02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:49.730
<v Speaker 2>those animals are not going to exist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be extremely,</v>

2646
02:11:49.731 --> 02:11:50.990
<v Speaker 2>extremely rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're rare.</v>

2647
02:11:50.991 --> 02:11:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an example of a,</v>

2648
02:11:53.110 --> 02:11:57.620
<v Speaker 2>a real large ranch out in Wyoming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's about a hundred thousand acres</v>

2649
02:11:57.621 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 2>and eight managed historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusively for these over mature mule</v>

2650
02:12:02.001 --> 02:12:03.680
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the ones with the antlers,</v>

2651
02:12:03.710 --> 02:12:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you know like that monstrous muled</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2652
02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Even in the good times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably killed maybe three of them</v>

2653
02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:10.670
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2654
02:12:10.671 --> 02:12:14.810
<v Speaker 2>On that vast acreage because you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of sources of mortality.</v>

2655
02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.480
<v Speaker 2>They're not anymore because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those deer living that long.</v>

2656
02:12:21.130 --> 02:12:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I think about it at math question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math quiz for,</v>

2657
02:12:23.381 --> 02:12:24.560
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for during here.</v>

2658
02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:27.890
<v Speaker 2>So in this population with super high</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence,</v>

2659
02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:33.380
<v Speaker 2>so let's say at 18 at 18 months of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yearling deer,</v>

2660
02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.890
<v Speaker 2>let's say they have 20% prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have that,</v>

2661
02:12:36.150 --> 02:12:41.150
<v Speaker 2>we demonstrated that at two and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably 30% prevalence at three</v>

2662
02:12:41.451 --> 02:12:43.090
<v Speaker 2>and a half and four and a half and above</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2663
02:12:43.170 --> 02:12:48.170
<v Speaker 2>it's close to 40 45 50% prevalence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a two year disease,</v>

2664
02:12:48.651 --> 02:12:53.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So half your prevalence dies every year.</v>

2665
02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>So if you have 20% prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of those deer are going to be dead</v>

2666
02:12:59.061 --> 02:13:01.070
<v Speaker 2>the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the year after that.</v>

2667
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So over time you would expect these</v>

2668
02:13:03.831 --> 02:13:07.340
<v Speaker 2>cohorts to diminish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the math question is in that</v>

2669
02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:10.730
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many five year old bucks are there?</v>

2670
02:13:10.731 --> 02:13:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Because disease penetrance grows over</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2671
02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:17.110
<v Speaker 2>The answer's not meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

2672
02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sound.</v>

2673
02:13:20.331 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 2>The alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2674
02:13:22.190 --> 02:13:22.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2675
02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2676
02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:25.760
<v Speaker 2>that really is the case and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2677
02:13:25.761 --> 02:13:27.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2678
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:28.263
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2679
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I wanted to bring along,</v>

2680
02:13:31.531 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>because he's</v>

2681
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 3>going to provide the science and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to try to break it down to,</v>

2682
02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:37.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug's level and,</v>

2683
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:39.240
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2684
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>folks can understand it and I know I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional about it,</v>

2685
02:13:41.461 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2686
02:13:41.970 --> 02:13:43.790
<v Speaker 3>part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2687
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 3>well my dad would be 94 years old today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's the guy that I started deer</v>

2688
02:13:48.301 --> 02:13:49.560
<v Speaker 3>hunting with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2689
02:13:49.561 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 3>he died a couple of years ago and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he grew up with that farm,</v>

2690
02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:57.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was my great grandfather's farm in</v>

2691
02:13:58.170 --> 02:13:59.910
<v Speaker 3>that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the driftless area.</v>

2692
02:13:59.911 --> 02:14:02.820
<v Speaker 3>And you've heard me talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>driftless area before and how important</v>

2693
02:14:02.821 --> 02:14:05.850
<v Speaker 3>that area is to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a big part of that area.</v>

2694
02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.480
<v Speaker 3>It is an emotional thing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I then look at the science</v>

2695
02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:15.030
<v Speaker 3>and what can we do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think about,</v>

2696
02:14:15.810 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about Elva Leopold,</v>

2697
02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:18.960
<v Speaker 3>what leopold do right now.</v>

2698
02:14:19.230 --> 02:14:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would he be thinking about this?</v>

2699
02:14:20.671 --> 02:14:21.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I old man?</v>

2700
02:14:21.391 --> 02:14:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I'd be thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2701
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I know what my dad would be saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always sat my,</v>

2702
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:30.780
<v Speaker 3>my antler thing was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he'd see a bucket on the</v>

2703
02:14:30.781 --> 02:14:31.770
<v Speaker 3>trail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical shooter,</v>

2704
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:33.450
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just like,</v>

2705
02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:35.340
<v Speaker 3>he was just an old school buck hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2706
02:14:35.341 --> 02:14:36.860
<v Speaker 3>He did an antler on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shot it.</v>

2707
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:41.400
<v Speaker 3>So all those things are in my head as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about this.</v>

2708
02:14:41.970 --> 02:14:42.803
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2709
02:14:42.930 --> 02:14:43.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2710
02:14:43.441 --> 02:14:47.850
<v Speaker 3>it's the emotion's important and I get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emotion part from all of these,</v>

2711
02:14:47.851 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these folks.</v>

2712
02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I understand that some of them want</v>

2713
02:14:51.381 --> 02:14:52.360
<v Speaker 3>to kill big bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2714
02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.990
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe because I have killed a couple of</v>

2715
02:14:54.991 --> 02:14:56.490
<v Speaker 3>big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it's not as important.</v>

2716
02:14:56.491 --> 02:14:57.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it has something to do with being</v>

2717
02:14:57.781 --> 02:15:00.930
<v Speaker 3>60 years old and maybe you understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences.</v>

2718
02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.450
<v Speaker 4>This is a real serious issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forget about the ego of killing a big</v>

2719
02:15:04.451 --> 02:15:08.140
<v Speaker 4>buck or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this desire to achieve something that's</v>

2720
02:15:08.141 --> 02:15:10.090
<v Speaker 4>more difficult than shooting a young</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

2721
02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:11.910
<v Speaker 4>There's more at stake here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2722
02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:16.630
<v Speaker 4>So you brought up an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would leah do and he,</v>

2723
02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>this disciple,</v>

2724
02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>father of modern wildlife ecology</v>

2725
02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:27.420
<v Speaker 4>started the first program of Wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 4>College at University of Wisconsin in</v>

2726
02:15:27.551 --> 02:15:32.551
<v Speaker 4>the 1940s populations of deer in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>northern part of Wisconsin.</v>

2727
02:15:34.301 --> 02:15:38.650
<v Speaker 4>We're growing by leaps and bounds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were dramatically changing the</v>

2728
02:15:38.651 --> 02:15:40.990
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM denuding the landscape,</v>

2729
02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:43.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating eastern white cedar and deer in</v>

2730
02:15:43.731 --> 02:15:46.900
<v Speaker 4>northern latitudes tend to yard together</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the wintertime.</v>

2731
02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:52.500
<v Speaker 4>And so leopold knew that this was</v>
<v Speaker 4>deleterious to the longterm viability of</v>

2732
02:15:53.561 --> 02:15:56.920
<v Speaker 4>that ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took people out,</v>

2733
02:15:57.070 --> 02:16:01.810
<v Speaker 4>landowners out in hunters out into these</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer yards in the spring to show them</v>

2734
02:16:01.811 --> 02:16:04.150
<v Speaker 4>how there was nothing to eat within</v>
<v Speaker 4>reach.</v>

2735
02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:08.350
<v Speaker 4>Of a deer on a hind feet and there were</v>
<v Speaker 4>bodies of dead deer that it stopped</v>

2736
02:16:08.351 --> 02:16:12.670
<v Speaker 4>through the wintertime in order to</v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate to them the consequences of</v>

2737
02:16:12.671 --> 02:16:15.490
<v Speaker 4>mismanagement if deere hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

2738
02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:20.080
<v Speaker 4>he was a real proponent of showing</v>
<v Speaker 4>people the results of doing things the</v>

2739
02:16:20.081 --> 02:16:22.540
<v Speaker 4>wrong way and education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>

2740
02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:23.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes back,</v>

2741
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:25.750
<v Speaker 4>it's what we're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not saying that,</v>

2742
02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:28.660
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're leopold in or anything like that,</v>

2743
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:32.670
<v Speaker 4>but education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting information out,</v>

2744
02:16:32.671 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 4>getting accurate information out as</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one of the biggest things we can</v>

2745
02:16:35.951 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys did down here today.</v>

2746
02:16:38.350 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 4>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for being here,</v>

2747
02:16:40.211 --> 02:16:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you doug for organizing that</v>

2748
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:45.550
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy we got a chance to talk</v>

2749
02:16:45.551 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 4>and scare the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for the opportunity.</v>

2750
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:50.860
<v Speaker 4>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you guys.</v>

2751
02:16:50.861 --> 02:16:51.220
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
