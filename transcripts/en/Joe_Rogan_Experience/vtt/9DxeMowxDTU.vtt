35
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.730

<v Speaker 1>much less two drunks into their home.</v>

41
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wouldn't give up man.</v>

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I go out the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup a payphone and call my dealer.</v>

120
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>He meets me outside and the doorman with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big rock in a stem.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it,</v>

122
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.370

<v Speaker 1>The disease.</v>

123
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:28.030

<v Speaker 1>or four months and not touch you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>door?</v>

125
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.800

<v Speaker 1>into your own to do this,</v>

126
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing pushups in the corner,</v>

127
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:36.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waiting on her.</v>

128
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.893

<v Speaker 1>for that long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the feeling like when you did </v>

133
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>slip up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because a couple of times,</v>

136
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.553
<v Speaker 1>lay him down and that really sucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here's a guy is opened up his </v>

<v Speaker 3>All gray hair and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seeing the snake and the bat,</v>

157
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I accidentally bent over picking </v>
<v Speaker 3>something up right there by his bed.</v>

158
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea my son was in his mouth.</v>

165
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>And he put me first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect that we would.</v>

166

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that addiction road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to run nightclubs,</v>

184
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 1>because that's where I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

185
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:22.321
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what it's like to wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and be angry that you woke up.</v>

186
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.100
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because I had gotten to the point.</v>

191
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.150
<v Speaker 1>I hated myself so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm begging God to die.</v>

192
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.853
<v Speaker 1>When I would hear another wrestler died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get angry at God and curse him for </v>

193
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>not taking me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

194
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.193
<v Speaker 1>when Piper died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about rodey before </v>

<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

<v Speaker 1>young really tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took 100 value.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's a surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milligram volume.</v>

201
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.753

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.264

205
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>torture that people put themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

206
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>that people get the wrong idea about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit man.</v>

207
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:24.210

212
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.713

<v Speaker 1>I could enjoy and getting high 30 years </v>

213
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:35.604
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem was I couldn't live </v>

214
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.530
<v Speaker 1>without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

215
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I would feel like my heart was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst.</v>

216
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was scared to go anywhere.</v>

217
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>She was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything or anything.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What was pulling you?</v>

220
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>What drug or what happened and what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

221
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.030

<v Speaker 1>It for me,</v>

222
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it was more everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

223
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky I didn't get to in the heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I probably wouldn't have beat that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

225
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah I would because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm meant to be doing right</v>

226
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.640
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to go through 25,</v>

227
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>30 years of doing cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

228
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Vince Mcmahon for affording me </v>

229
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>my addiction because without it I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in prison somewhere because I would have</v>

230
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 1>killed somebody for my drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

231
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have knifed and whatever.</v>

232

234
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:36.564

<v Speaker 1>too ugly</v>

252
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 1>to want to go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did it start?</v>

253
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Did it start when you pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>career started or before then?</v>

254
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

255
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.823
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cocaine and alcohol alcohol was </v>

256
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:38.900
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

257
00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I started drinking when I was 11 or 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

258
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.943
<v Speaker 1>My uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather was an alcoholic drug slash </v>

259
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.870
<v Speaker 1>drug addict because it started with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oilfield accident.</v>

260
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>He got his legs crushed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he refused his legs cut off.</v>

261
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So he stayed in the hospital for 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

262
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 twenties,</v>

263
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.470
<v Speaker 1>the way that they fixed you let it heal </v>
<v Speaker 1>then rebreak it,</v>

264
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they did.</v>

265
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They didn't put bars and metal in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>to straighten it out.</v>

266
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 1>They'd let it heal and they'd break in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

267
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they kept him,</v>

268
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 1>kept him on morphine for a year and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

269
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Was the end of the year and half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They patted him on the back.</v>

270
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>See you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had little itch going out there,</v>

271
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't he could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he could walk.</v>

272
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.430
<v Speaker 1>So it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it took you a hooked up on morphine.</v>

273
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.573
<v Speaker 1>Which back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like today you can get on any </v>

274
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:36.470
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

275
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>He went to alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in the sixties,</v>

276
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:40.834
<v Speaker 1>which is 40 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They not trusting him to come to the </v>

277
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>doctor's office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>

278
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>they didn't trust him to take the pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pill,</v>

279
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.430
<v Speaker 1>the pill being a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

282
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd taken an abuse bill.</v>

283
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a pita.</v>

284
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've drank on an abuse when it's been </v>

285
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.123
<v Speaker 1>two days since I'd had the pill and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a drink whether you have no idea </v>

286
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.293
<v Speaker 1>how scary that shit is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately you start throwing up and </v>

287
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you start pissing and shitting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

288
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.613
<v Speaker 1>It happens that quick and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start with the sweats and all this </v>

289
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>and you'll wind up on the floor during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Heebie jeebies man,</v>

290
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.103
<v Speaker 1>that sounds strong and abuse as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even trust him to take the </v>

291
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

292
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:33.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

293
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>You take a taxi to the doctor's office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll give you a shot.</v>

294
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.360

<v Speaker 1>that pill.</v>

295
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.523
<v Speaker 1>So He'd do that every morning and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>go outside and get in the same taxi and </v>

296
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:50.920
<v Speaker 1>because we lived in a dry county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would take that same taxi over to the</v>

<v Speaker 1>next county and get a fifth of whiskey </v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't turn away from it because </v>

306
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>there's hope in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the hope for no more pain?</v>

307
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 1>So just that it numbs more shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shame.</v>

308
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Shame is something you put on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you can't shame me,</v>

309
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

310
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.063
<v Speaker 1>The man who was their man in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd went through some ugly shit </v>

311
00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:47.630
<v Speaker 1>as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being sexually molested,</v>

312
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.820
<v Speaker 1>my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being molested too,</v>

313
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>and then my sister and murdered and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got all these things thrown in there and</v>

314
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I was hating myself because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect my sister better.</v>

315
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>life happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do with it.</v>

317
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that Dallas </v>
<v Speaker 1>preaches,</v>

318
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.374
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He got all this stuff out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

320
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to do with accounts.</v>

321
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't deflect it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you spit it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swept,</v>

324
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.103
<v Speaker 1>sift through the bullshit and you go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something I couldn't do because they </v>

325
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 1>got personal with me and I would lock </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

326
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd shut up because that's how I handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

327
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't talk about it.</v>

328
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:39.310
<v Speaker 1>When you've been sexually molested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no good moment and that screwed</v>

329
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>my head up and it still messes with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

330
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.683
<v Speaker 1>I desperately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately want to have a relationship </v>

331
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 1>with a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No true relationship.</v>

332
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 63 because I did have relationships</v>

333
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:58.034
<v Speaker 1>before that I was constantly sabotaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I didn't trust women with </v>

334
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last one,</v>

335
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.613
<v Speaker 1>he raped me and beat me and threatened </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and told me that my dad killed me </v>

336
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:10.934
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad was seven foot and weighed 425 </v>

337
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 1>pounds so he could get the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted my dad to be proud of me.</v>

338
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:18.404
<v Speaker 1>So all these things are a factor now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quiet while the wife beats me and made </v>

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.120
<v Speaker 1>me do her and then beats me afterwards.</v>

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.073
<v Speaker 1>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's 22 years old because my father is </v>

350
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 1>a child molester for Christ's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course she was on,</v>

351
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't hot to me because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom know.</v>

352
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.863
<v Speaker 1>And then the bds afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking confused as you got all </v>

353
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:08.540
<v Speaker 1>this shit going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

354
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So you start looking for a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a kid,</v>

355
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.513
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather would get drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget where he hit his liquor because </v>

356
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>he had to hide it from her grandmother </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she knew what he was.</v>

357
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>She had dealt with it for 50 years.</v>

358
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 1>So every time she found a bottle on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm she'd break it.</v>

359
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would hide it.</v>

360
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:28.971
<v Speaker 1>Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my house,</v>

361
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:29.804
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well me and my buddies from girls </v>

362
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 1>straight with go out and find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get 12 years old,</v>

363
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:36.974
<v Speaker 1>11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we got smart and started selling </v>

364
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>into the other neighborhood kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a buck.</v>

365
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.340
<v Speaker 1>That was my beginning of the drink man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

366
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as time goes on,</v>

367
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:53.051
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start smoking weed in the pills.</v>

368
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>What else is next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm still not forgetting.</v>

369
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm still remembering this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go out and you try to have a </v>

370
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.264
<v Speaker 1>good time with people and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize something's different than you </v>

371
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.740
<v Speaker 1>because drugs it put you to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wake me up,</v>

372
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>downers.</v>

373
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Wake me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the council,</v>

374
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me five Percocet,</v>

375
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:21.924
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll drink a case of beer and dance all </v>

376
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:25.044
<v Speaker 1>night for you.</v>

377
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.820
<v Speaker 3>Really go out and have three or four </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling matches.</v>

378
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I tell you</v>

379
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.290
<v Speaker 1>when I've messed my neck up and 89 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a guitar,</v>

380
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.540
<v Speaker 1>when I wanted to go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my regimen was to wake up,</v>

381
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.520
<v Speaker 1>go downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts coffeemaker.</v>

382
00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Take two men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 milligram percocet them in my mouth,</v>

383
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.130
<v Speaker 1>chew them up and wash them down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee and hit the gym.</v>

384
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it because I was on fire man.</v>

385
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Plus the percocet made me a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>gnarly.</v>

386
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Made me want to punch in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

387
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.280
<v Speaker 1>So you get a good workout in anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>good from percosets.</v>

388
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.430
<v Speaker 1>That's how screwed up my wiring is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

389
00:19:06.431 --> 00:19:09.280
<v Speaker 1>So you talked to any drug and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you their wiring.</v>

390
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that make you go to sleep.</v>

391
00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Wake me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that wake you up but me to sleep.</v>

392
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.160
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain of pro wrestling,</v>

393
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.023
<v Speaker 1>which is probably one of the most brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>professions and the person can embark </v>

394
00:19:22.211 --> 00:19:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and write and think about all the days </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were on the road,</v>

395
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.910
<v Speaker 1>all the many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many matches,</v>

396
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.120
<v Speaker 1>all that physical pain probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>justified the drugs even more.</v>

397
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't care about the fact.</v>

398
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt no pain.</v>

399
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled none afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

400
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I was wrestling in a guy in Louisiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ernie the cat lad,</v>

401
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you remember him playing for the Afl San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego chargers.</v>

402
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.070
<v Speaker 1>He's in the hall of fame football and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

403
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.030
<v Speaker 1>60 nine slash three slash 50 bad ass son</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a bitch,</v>

404
00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:01.541

405
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:02.374
<v Speaker 1>but back then they had chopped box and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had like 15 knee surgeries and that </v>

406
00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:05.794
<v Speaker 1>was in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were wrestling and my bone came </v>

407
00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:13.240
<v Speaker 1>out of my arm compound fracture and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

410
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.400

<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

411
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.720
<v Speaker 1>get away from me and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get to him.</v>

412
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And he started puking on me.</v>

413
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

414

<v Speaker 3>Your arm and your arm is fucking bomb.</v>

416
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.460

<v Speaker 3>I'm getting out of the way,</v>

417

<v Speaker 3>He could pick up a bunch of shit.</v>

418
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>You finish off your opponent by having </v>
<v Speaker 3>them nasty smelling shit to.</v>

419
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 3>But I was fine.</v>

420
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I got back in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

421
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there and I was always </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

422
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a blow on the bone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this light's.</v>

430
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.010

431
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:15.821
<v Speaker 1>the bone and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>as a minor and it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about injuries when you around</v>

465

<v Speaker 4>Jake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The snake because it's embarrassing.</v>

469
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Should be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Torres,</v>

470
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.991
<v Speaker 4>Torres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Giant tortoise band giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was horrible.</v>

472
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.053
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's a good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not stand here while he </v>

473
00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:20.354
<v Speaker 1>disparaged him.</v>

474
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.860
<v Speaker 4>Shelby's though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it</v>

475
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.140
<v Speaker 1>dealt the snake did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a snake a problem when you would get</v>

476
00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:29.930
<v Speaker 1>on planes and ships them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven.</v>

477
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Could you keep it secret or would they </v>
<v Speaker 1>let you on the plane with it?</v>

478
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never said anything to anybody.</v>

479
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:36.790
<v Speaker 1>It just brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

480
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 1>I just put it in a trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little blanket around the bag and then</v>

481
00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 1>locked the truck.</v>

482
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.500
<v Speaker 4>You carry it on or what you check?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Check it.</v>

485
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.400

<v Speaker 3>Forty thousand feet off the ground.</v>

486
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.620
<v Speaker 3>You goddamn noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The snake,</v>

487
00:23:56.621 --> 00:23:57.454
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

488
00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.560
<v Speaker 1>You laugh about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

489
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.023
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a trade the snake out after 10 </v>

490
00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:03.221
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

491
00:24:03.221 --> 00:24:04.180
<v Speaker 1>they can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

492
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.163
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a fucking snake can't live through </v>

493
00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:09.004
<v Speaker 1>the fucking scheduling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet I'm asked to do 90 fucking days </v>

494
00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:14.380
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have different snakes?</v>

495
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

496
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.933
<v Speaker 1>About every 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which used to be funny because people </v>

497
00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>say she brang Damien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you notice it Damien,</v>

498
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:20.840
<v Speaker 1>some weeks it's five years,</v>

499
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.720
<v Speaker 3>put middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not shrinkage honey.</v>

500
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.280
<v Speaker 3>So your seven days a week would go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the whole year.</v>

501
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just worked.</v>

502
00:24:32.821 --> 00:24:33.654
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

503
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.493
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled steamboat nine 93 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and about three days in I had </v>

504
00:24:42.091 --> 00:24:42.924
<v Speaker 1>to call my wife and her come take me </v>
<v Speaker 1>around because I'd gotten dumbed out to </v>

505
00:24:47.491 --> 00:24:50.550
<v Speaker 1>the point that I couldn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd get to the airport,</v>

506
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.623
<v Speaker 1>know that they want tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have no idea where they're at and </v>

507
00:24:54.901 --> 00:24:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't read anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd look at stuff to read,</v>

508
00:24:57.511 --> 00:24:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but it just wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't work.</v>

509
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So I just ended up making fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion.</v>

510
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exhaustion.</v>

511
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.620
<v Speaker 1>You just get so beat up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

512
00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Your body's hurting so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say steroids,</v>

513
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:11.424
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were taking steroids just to try to </v>

514
00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:13.284
<v Speaker 1>get healthy to heal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the shit was invented </v>

515
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 1>for recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that they invented in World War</v>

516
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.643
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes what the story was for the </v>

517
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.223
<v Speaker 1>prisoners of war because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want the American soldiers to come home </v>

518
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.200
<v Speaker 1>looking like they did.</v>

519
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.873
<v Speaker 1>So they put them on slow fucking boats </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fed them for three months and guys </v>

520
00:25:36.901 --> 00:25:38.190
<v Speaker 1>put on 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 pounds.</v>

521
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.680
<v Speaker 1>They say there would have been another </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

522
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.923
<v Speaker 1>They'd have brought those troops home </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from concentration camps for the </v>

523
00:25:45.091 --> 00:25:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Germans or the Japanese and we'd have </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen the way they were.</v>

524
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And of course now that you can see some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those old films of the way the Jews,</v>

525
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.310
<v Speaker 1>they were being slaughtered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

526
00:25:56.311 --> 00:25:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And a bag of bones was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did.</v>

527
00:25:59.731 --> 00:26:01.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to bring those troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

528
00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So they invented steroids and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>popping everybody when that shit.</v>

529
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And bring them back.</v>

530
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.600
<v Speaker 1>But we did it really just to try to tee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it hard to get them right?</v>

531
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

532
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Well did they help you get them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

533
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.790

<v Speaker 1>but</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

536
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Now when somebody told me this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and like this is an old wives tale</v>

537
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.870
<v Speaker 1>because shit like that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You get to get downtown Hershey,</v>

00:38:05.511 --> 00:38:06.380
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

778
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.300
<v Speaker 1>how often they eat once ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks or so.</v>

779
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

780
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 1>The action and the flying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

781
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:14.214
<v Speaker 1>They'd only live for 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to get them off the road and </v>

782
00:38:16.291 --> 00:38:17.124
<v Speaker 1>let them heal because of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lungs go the entire length of their </v>

783
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:22.320
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very tiny,</v>

784
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.400
<v Speaker 1>so they get pneumonia really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course being in minus 40,</v>

785
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do get pneumonia really easy.</v>

786
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Would you have to get a new snake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that your responsibility?</v>

787
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.270

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in Connecticut men and they asked</v>

<v Speaker 1>them about this Mexican rattler.</v>

855
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:55.993
<v Speaker 1>And he knows that he's fucked because </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing about Mexican </v>

856
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.050
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not many of those in Connecticut.</v>

857
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have any answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

858
00:42:05.711 --> 00:42:06.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

859
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

860
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 1>they got to fly it in from fucking deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta or wherever.</v>

861
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So by the time they get that shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

862
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked up.</v>

863
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And they went out and they cut all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat off one of his bones on his finger.</v>

864
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So you got like this gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had a necropsy right?</v>

865
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a video or a website rather </v>

866
00:42:23.451 --> 00:42:24.284
<v Speaker 1>detailing this kid got bit in the arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no meat had to get him somewhere to </v>

867
00:42:28.821 --> 00:42:29.210
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

868
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 1>But it took hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that medivac helicopter,</v>

869
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 1>his whole arm rotted away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the bone.</v>

870
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 1>So they had to take meat from his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it off and put,</v>

871
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to do skin grafts all over.</v>

872
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he went through like 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>

873
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 1>She's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a stitch them all together,</v>

874
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:51.040
<v Speaker 1>like pull the meat of his arm together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stitch it all together.</v>

875
00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a giant 10 to 12 inch </v>
<v Speaker 1>patch of his arm.</v>

876
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Was Gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:42:56.101 --> 00:42:56.934
<v Speaker 1>it fucks you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really cool looking thing that it does </v>

878
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 1>is it causes all the small capillaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your eyes to burst.</v>

879
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So your eyes are like blood red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they're bumpy.</v>

880
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.880
<v Speaker 1>like he closed his eyes and I run my </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger over his eyelid and you just feel</v>

882
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 1>all these little bumps and crevices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat damaged.</v>

883
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Weird to take for him to recover.</v>

884
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.090
<v Speaker 1>He's in the hospital for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>

885
00:43:20.091 --> 00:43:20.924

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 1>he had to put him in a coma for like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

887
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because I know a lot of those.</v>

891
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.790

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

929
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.490
<v Speaker 5>It's the thing that had escaped two </v>
<v Speaker 5>months later,</v>

930
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 5>he had gained like 35 pounds.</v>

931
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's dogs and cats in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood.</v>

932
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 5>A couple of kids to who?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is such a ruthless animal,</v>

933
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:34.224
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things are so ruthless that the </v>

934
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:36.564
<v Speaker 5>little baby Komodo dragon smear shit on </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves so that the grownups don't </v>

935
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:42.630
<v Speaker 5>eat them so that their parents don't eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

936
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.380
<v Speaker 5>They roll around and shit so that their </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents don't eat them.</v>

937
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:47.693
<v Speaker 5>Because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Komodo dragons are eating </v>

938
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:52.490
<v Speaker 5>intestines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they shake the shit out of intestines.</v>

939
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:57.830
<v Speaker 5>They don't like to eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As weird as that is bad attitude.</v>

940
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:04.590
<v Speaker 5>I had a problem with cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that they eat their fucking kids</v>

941
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:05.424
<v Speaker 5>so the kids know this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they somehow or another like no to </v>

942
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 5>smear themselves and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd learned pretty quick.</v>

943
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see your sister get chewed up.</v>

944
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 5>I see them avoid shit but eat your </v>
<v Speaker 5>sister.</v>

945
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Yo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It had gained 30 pounds.</v>

947
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

948
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Let it loose in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They won't even notice.</v>

949
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.520
<v Speaker 5>Fuck everything else they got down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

950
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.140
<v Speaker 5>The Florida everglades is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Python's man.</v>

951
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.450
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so bad that they're eating alligators.</v>

952
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:37.284
<v Speaker 5>They did this study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found that they couldn't find any </v>

953
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:40.374
<v Speaker 5>raccoons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't find any swamp rabbits or </v>

954
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.100
<v Speaker 5>march hares,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything got killed by python.</v>

956
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:48.930
<v Speaker 5>So then the pythons moved on to </v>
<v Speaker 5>alligators.</v>

957
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alligators.</v>

977
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:56.683
<v Speaker 1>because I listened to Monday night </v>
<v Speaker 1>football and they were talking about </v>

978
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Stabler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember him playing for the raiders.</v>

979
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I remember the name of 10 quarterback </v>

<v Speaker 1>And he also liked to party man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>final moment of the royal rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a huge long buildup and it's </v>

1110
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:28.850
<v Speaker 5>controversial because they both went </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the top and landed,</v>

1111
00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 5>so there's this tide,</v>

1119
00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.493
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the fact that that guy was able to </v>

1120
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:01.044
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to bring this up because we were </v>

1121
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:03.024
<v Speaker 5>watching this in the greenroom.</v>

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:23.643
<v Speaker 5>It was a real guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really surprising to me because </v>

1130
00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:30.060
<v Speaker 5>it always appeared like the honky tonks </v>
<v Speaker 5>guitar was just an exploding.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but it was a highly controversial </v>

1135
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.180
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:54.954
<v Speaker 5>He's way thicker than he's ever been </v>
<v Speaker 5>before because when they showed him on </v>

1139
00:55:56.611 --> 00:55:58.230
<v Speaker 5>tmz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was running around.</v>

1146
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.410
<v Speaker 5>Hated it because your dad did it because</v>

1147
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:25.630
<v Speaker 5>so I blamed the wrestling for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never being home.</v>

1148
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:28.510

01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:49.181
<v Speaker 1>and my second wife poor month third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm getting better a lot better.</v>

1273
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>But it sounds like you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

1274
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I did 13 years about marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said 13 years.</v>

1275
01:01:55.521 --> 01:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That's like sam kinison and 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it goes,</v>

1276
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1277
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience is unfortunate because </v>

1278
01:02:03.331 --> 01:02:04.161
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been through.</v>

1279
01:02:04.161 --> 01:02:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I left home and get this close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're about to get started getting real,</v>

1280
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.823
<v Speaker 1>which is what I really want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I got to push you back because </v>

1281
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle it.</v>

1282
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I want to get back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happened to the cats?</v>

1283
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:18.643
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1284
01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.693

<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find them this long as long </v>

1285
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:26.850

1286
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:27.763

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1287
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:28.763
<v Speaker 1>right before she got home I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do the man thing and get my car </v>

1288
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:32.664
<v Speaker 1>and run.</v>

1289
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what he did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>knew would not look good with high heels</v>
<v Speaker 1>going up and down it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1296
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.873
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm not sleeping with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to talk shit like that </v>

1297
01:02:58.771 --> 01:02:59.604
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to it if I'm sleeping with </v>

<v Speaker 1>two days later.</v>

1302
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.353
<v Speaker 1>And when I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see all these workmen carrying sheets </v>

1303
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 1>of sheet rock,</v>

<v Speaker 1>going to do some remodeling downstairs </v>

1306
01:03:23.811 --> 01:03:24.381

1308
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.040
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1314
01:03:43.941 --> 01:03:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So they wound up calling some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>

1315
01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.433
<v Speaker 1>And the only way they found it was by </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying out several walls and they </v>

1316
01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:54.020
<v Speaker 1>finally found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the walls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Climate event and got in the bed </v>

<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.610
<v Speaker 1>How did they find it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By running out of walls?</v>

1322

1349
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.273
<v Speaker 1>So he goes and gets another dressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>room on the other side of these </v>

1350
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>coliseum,</v>

1351
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.430
<v Speaker 1>on the colosseum in rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We across there,</v>

1352
01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:45.870
<v Speaker 1>he wrestles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into shower,</v>

1353
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>comes out from the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's drying off.</v>

1354
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.733
<v Speaker 1>He looks up in the mirror in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can see a pile of cobra is come up </v>

1355
01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:54.893
<v Speaker 1>out of the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was looking around the room and the </v>

1356
01:05:58.051 --> 01:06:01.260
<v Speaker 1>rest of him still on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he goes back down.</v>

1357
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:03.743
<v Speaker 1>He screamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs across the fucking building </v>

1358
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.070
<v Speaker 1>nude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which got everybody's attention.</v>

1359
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>The police get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes down to jake words,</v>

1360
01:06:13.501 --> 01:06:16.830
<v Speaker 1>your fucking snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really can't find it.</v>

1361
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:18.523
<v Speaker 1>So he had gotten out of my locker room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went into the toilet and took off </v>

1362
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>and come up in that toilet over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got on a fucking airplane that night</v>

1363
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and went the fuck home.</v>

1364
01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:31.733
<v Speaker 5>Manages the snake that he was scared of </v>
<v Speaker 5>her did and then went and found the </v>

1365
01:06:36.241 --> 01:06:39.160
<v Speaker 5>place where there was the most feared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1366
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.920
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1367
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:43.530
<v Speaker 5>it only makes sense that you sent your </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents.</v>

1368
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.750
<v Speaker 5>They would go after prey animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1369
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My animals are terrified of them.</v>

1370
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:52.620
<v Speaker 5>They probably have a sense of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fucking toilet you imagine that goes</v>

1371
01:06:52.621 --> 01:06:53.820
<v Speaker 5>to the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1372
01:06:53.821 --> 01:06:54.654
<v Speaker 5>I still have horror stories and bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>memories of sitting on a toilet and a </v>

1373
01:06:57.561 --> 01:07:01.050
<v Speaker 5>snake just by the balls and that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to,</v>

1374
01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:01.884
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I had those fucking dreams come to </v>

1375
01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 5>me because I had those snakes all those </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking years.</v>

1376
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.180
<v Speaker 5>Especially after that no one can travel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that will again.</v>

1377
01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 5>How'd you get the snake back?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

1378
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I left him over there and fucking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Australia.</v>

1379
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:20.510
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now he's taking over the country.</v>

1380
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.150
<v Speaker 5>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's that fucking snake?</v>

1381
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.900
<v Speaker 5>It's in melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I left him.</v>

1382
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 5>How long do those things live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how long?</v>

1383
01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.453
<v Speaker 5>Thirty years or years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's probably still alive and the </v>

1384
01:07:34.411 --> 01:07:39.411
<v Speaker 5>toilets savy of that auditorium was </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking around and eat nash.</v>

1385
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:43.110
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1582
01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.870

<v Speaker 1>he'd grab each side of the rope under </v>

1588

<v Speaker 1>the last drop.</v>

01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Tell me I'm a stupid fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to get out of the ring for the giant</v>

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.413

<v Speaker 1>a great bad guy or did you sort of </v>

1617
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:50.144
<v Speaker 1>relish in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a good guy is so boring because </v>

1618
01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:58.010
<v Speaker 1>people expect you to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They expect you to this picture with the</v>

1619
01:18:58.011 --> 01:19:03.011
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a bad guy you can do anything and</v>

1620
01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:05.610
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1621
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to see how far you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take people.</v>

1622
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people freak is kind of bugs.</v>

1623
01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 1>People freaks them out a little bit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about starting a riot,</v>

1624
01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you know you'Ve done </v>
<v Speaker 1>your job right?</v>

1625
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:20.803
<v Speaker 1>When you can get people to step out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their comfort zone and come into the </v>

1626
01:19:24.291 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 1>ring after you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you'Ve done the job.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 times.</v>

1630
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.830
<v Speaker 1>People charge the ring.</v>

1845
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.153

<v Speaker 1>going to take the poisonous tree.</v>

1888
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what's ironic is that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

01:31:42.461 --> 01:31:43.294
<v Speaker 2>your film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your story and who you are right now is </v>

1890
01:31:45.851 --> 01:31:46.684
<v Speaker 2>one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just say no commercIals they could ever </v>

1891
01:31:48.221 --> 01:31:52.810
<v Speaker 2>do that may be for real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't just say no,</v>

1892
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.200
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no ridiculous bullshit ever said.</v>

1893
01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you show that in the film that </v>

1894
01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you want to say</v>

1895
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.993
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is one of the more powerful </v>

1896
01:32:02.621 --> 01:32:03.454
<v Speaker 1>things about that film is not just that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you succeeded but that you tried and </v>

1897
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>failed several times until you succeeded</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you detailed all of it,</v>

1898
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 1>all the warts and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single step of the way.</v>

1899
01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a very brave movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1900
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It really is shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1901
01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.830
<v Speaker 1>no you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was tough.</v>

1902
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.753
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm getting to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and for me I'm doing this comedy </v>

1903
01:32:29.621 --> 01:32:30.454
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's not really comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just go out until road stories and </v>

1904
01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:32.761
<v Speaker 1>shIt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1905
01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I could have the storage module,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just told you much.</v>

1906
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I do the same stuff in buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've wrestled for 36 years,</v>

1907
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:47.010
<v Speaker 1>so I've got about 10 shows to do and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>still on the first one going around with</v>

<v Speaker 1>half years now,</v>

1909
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm enjoying it so much.</v>

1910
01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Not because I'm making people laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm getting connected.</v>

1911
01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting to connect with people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are needing help.</v>

1912
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.690
<v Speaker 1>People come to the show and tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1913
01:33:04.691 --> 01:33:05.524
<v Speaker 1>give me the icky man.</v>

1914
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.583
<v Speaker 1>talk in some of the stories I have met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make my story sound like a fucking walk </v>

1915
01:33:14.591 --> 01:33:15.580
<v Speaker 1>in the park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1916
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the horror stories I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard where people are going through and</v>

1917
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:25.210
<v Speaker 1>suffering through and their story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're paying their anger,</v>

1918

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1920
01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:31.534
<v Speaker 1>getting to help them find the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get to hear the stories of </v>

1921
01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the success stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

1926
01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.573
<v Speaker 1>Those are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the best is the letter from the six </v>

1927
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:53.521
<v Speaker 1>year old says you helped my daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daddy loves you and I love you too.</v>

1928
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Because my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives with me now.</v>

1929
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck me man.</v>

1932
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Can't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get what dallas does.</v>

1933
01:34:05.231 --> 01:34:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he helps people,</v>

1934
01:34:06.911 --> 01:34:09.010
<v Speaker 1>he gets a high off of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bleSs him.</v>

1935
01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:13.520
<v Speaker 1>He should get high off of it because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>spends a lot of time doing bro.</v>

1936
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:14.523
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing I always thought </v>

1937
01:34:17.081 --> 01:34:17.914
<v Speaker 1>about dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He may not be the smartest guy in the </v>

1938
01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:21.064
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's smart enough to know that and </v>

1939
01:34:23.561 --> 01:34:26.200
<v Speaker 1>he'll go find that right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1940
01:34:26.201 --> 01:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever he was dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and scott,</v>

1941
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.070
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know how to be an addict or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that was about.</v>

1942
01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:31.023
<v Speaker 1>So what'd you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He contacted all of his buddies or his </v>

1943
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:38.371
<v Speaker 1>ex buddies that had been through it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he went and he read and he read any self</v>

1944
01:34:39.731 --> 01:34:41.710
<v Speaker 1>taught man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to have a problem reading.</v>

1945
01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.553
<v Speaker 1>We've got it down now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a guy that overprepared for </v>

1946

<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

1948
01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.233
<v Speaker 1>that's also why you started ddp yoga to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to heal his body </v>

1949
01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:54.640
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

<v Speaker 4>worldwide if you ever done it.</v>

01:35:11.491 --> 01:35:12.324
<v Speaker 1>you can make it as difficult as you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the beauty of it because you </v>

1959
01:35:15.421 --> 01:35:19.550

<v Speaker 1>Not supposed to.</v>

2036
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:46.570
<v Speaker 1>The doctor was yelling at me as we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the building.</v>

2038
01:38:52.391 --> 01:38:53.224
<v Speaker 1>thing probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I use walking in a crosswalk to </v>

2039
01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:56.554
<v Speaker 1>connect the two buildings and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already went up to the bottom and I was </v>

2040
01:38:58.091 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 1>going to the car and he's beaten on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking window.</v>

2041
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Light was like a full hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Severed the top of the femur and they </v>

2042
01:39:04.211 --> 01:39:05.260
<v Speaker 1>put a new joint.</v>

2043
01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.720
<v Speaker 1>They screw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen how they do it?</v>

2044
01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2045
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:10.663

<v Speaker 1>There is a god damn huge bolt that goes </v>

2046
01:39:13.091 --> 01:39:13.924
<v Speaker 1>in the center of your bone and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>right through the bone and screws in </v>

2047
01:39:17.321 --> 01:39:18.154
<v Speaker 1>place and then you have this new joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one I had was brutal because </v>

2048
01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:23.163
<v Speaker 1>the whole joining calcified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took him three and a half hours to </v>

2049
01:39:27.731 --> 01:39:29.770
<v Speaker 1>get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god.</v>

2050
01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.550
<v Speaker 1>And they said they finally went to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring in the big hammer,</v>

2051
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went from these shiny silver hammer</v>

2052
01:39:36.791 --> 01:39:41.330
<v Speaker 1>to get clogged fucking sledge out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truck and bring it on.</v>

2053
01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And you know how a cauliflower ear your </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>

2054
01:39:44.621 --> 01:39:45.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what it is yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:48.670
<v Speaker 1>The breaking cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Blood blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>

2058
01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:51.093
<v Speaker 1>blood calcifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So blood becomes really turns into a </v>

2059
01:39:54.131 --> 01:39:54.964
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get that in your nose and he's </v>

2060
01:39:56.831 --> 01:39:57.030
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>

2061
01:39:57.030 --> 01:40:00.880
<v Speaker 1>He had that in his joint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he basically had rocks in his joint,</v>

2062
01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:05.740
<v Speaker 1>completely calcified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking arm wrestled for three or</v>

2063
01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:06.574
<v Speaker 1>four years like that.</v>

2064
01:40:08.651 --> 01:40:09.484
<v Speaker 1>and talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I would do is couldn't do anything </v>

2065
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 1>with this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can hear you,</v>

2066
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:19.941
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately when you do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would sleep and grabbed the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The femur was born.</v>

2069
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:27.283
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are putting so much torque in that </v>

2070
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:29.604
<v Speaker 1>you were blowing your hip out of socket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your left hook and rotate out of </v>

2071
01:40:33.421 --> 01:40:35.590
<v Speaker 1>socket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would been the femur bone.</v>

2072
01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it for the doctor and he was like,</v>

2073
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:39.533
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I first witnessed seeing </v>

2074
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:42.000
<v Speaker 1>the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how'd you get it?</v>

2075
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And I saw when I drove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2076
01:40:43.141 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you get to the room?</v>

2077
01:40:44.011 --> 01:40:44.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2078
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:47.330
<v Speaker 1>what is impossible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen your expert.</v>

2079
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can walk the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

2080
01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.171
<v Speaker 1>And I showed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2081
01:40:51.171 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He runs out of the room of my.</v>

2082
01:40:53.291 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I got</v>

2083
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.843
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying.</v>

2084
01:40:55.230 --> 01:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference between a regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that when a guy like you,</v>

2085
01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 2>like your tolerance for paints probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the fucking roof,</v>

2086
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:03.680
<v Speaker 2>he probably just so accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recognize it.</v>

2087
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously with your Arm broken when</v>

2088
01:41:06.131 --> 01:41:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to keep wrestling,</v>

2089
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:10.480
<v Speaker 1>don't you don't recognize pain because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just somethings you do.</v>

2090
01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:11.913
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were times in my career where </v>

2091
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>

2092
01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>like it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all right.</v>

2093
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a lie because you are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2094
01:41:20.191 --> 01:41:23.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just adrenaline flowing so much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so jacked on that shit.</v>

2095
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real drug and adrenaline.</v>

2096
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:29.583
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

2097
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:31.520
<v Speaker 2>jamie will show you how to do it,</v>

2098
01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:35.543
<v Speaker 3>but your back in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the tension from this spring </v>

2099
01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:38.890
<v Speaker 3>trap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're will save your life,</v>

2100
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:41.663
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2101
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Now when you do in these traveling </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>

2102
01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you doing them in comedy clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

2103
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:47.280
<v Speaker 2>How many clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bars,</v>

2104
01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.890
<v Speaker 1>hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convention room,</v>

2105
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:52.803
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be great for you too </v>

2106
01:41:53.701 --> 01:41:54.534
<v Speaker 2>because at the beginning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that was evident was </v>

2107
01:41:57.691 --> 01:41:58.524
<v Speaker 2>that you missed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you missed the whole excitement of </v>

2108
01:42:01.051 --> 01:42:02.130
<v Speaker 2>performing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

2109
01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:05.580
<v Speaker 2>It was missing from your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you've got that back,</v>

2110
01:42:05.581 --> 01:42:07.680
<v Speaker 2>but also healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

2111
01:42:07.681 --> 01:42:10.470
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also helping people.</v>

2112
01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2113
01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:14.610
<v Speaker 1>it's such a joy to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

2114
01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:15.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first went back,</v>

2115
01:42:15.991 --> 01:42:18.660
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I abused myself so much,</v>

2116
01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>my memory was shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember shit man.</v>

2117
01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:23.843
<v Speaker 1>And then as I tell one story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little glimmer will happen over here </v>

2118
01:42:27.691 --> 01:42:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and then then I'll talk to somebody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd and they'll mention,</v>

2119
01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't wrestle that guy.</v>

2120
01:42:32.791 --> 01:42:33.624
<v Speaker 1>The hail you didn't tell and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember wrestling this guy doing this </v>

2121
01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:39.930
<v Speaker 1>with that one and they make me remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2122
01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.333
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I've got like 10 shows waiting and </v>

2123
01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.020
<v Speaker 1>at first I had to really struggle to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>one show together.</v>

2124
01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Did you write them all out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did in the beginning.</v>

2125
01:42:49.170 --> 01:42:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Now I just write bullet points and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull them back up,</v>

2126
01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 1>which was so nice to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2127
01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.420
<v Speaker 1>because I was an appointment with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

2128
01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't finish sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just,</v>

2129
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2130
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:02.843
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the film you did it with mick </v>

2131
01:43:03.381 --> 01:43:04.214
<v Speaker 2>foley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing them with mick on the </v>

2132

<v Speaker 2>road?</v>

2133
01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.081
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2134
01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:07.160
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing good ones now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Match.</v>

2141

<v Speaker 3>When you just go in and pummeled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>god for three minutes and squashing,</v>

2142
01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.320
<v Speaker 3>lay them out on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even get to breathe,</v>

2143
01:43:40.321 --> 01:43:41.154
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was like you're telling another </v>

2144
01:43:42.241 --> 01:43:43.140
<v Speaker 3>wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2145
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll see if we can't get you into squash</v>
<v Speaker 3>match every.</v>

2146
01:43:45.291 --> 01:43:47.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a piece of shit.</v>

2147
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to use you and toss you </v>
<v Speaker 3>over in the corner when it's done.</v>

2148
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Was that like a rite of passage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have to do squash</v>

2149
01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:55.160
<v Speaker 2>matches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys don't know.</v>

2150
01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.173
<v Speaker 1>We did back in my day though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started at the bottom and you work </v>

2151
01:43:59.581 --> 01:44:02.730
<v Speaker 1>your way up now you've got guys who go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to school for three months.</v>

2152
01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never learned their art.</v>

2153
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.923
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go into school to learn </v>

2154
01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:08.910
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not something that existed,</v>

2155
01:44:08.911 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 2>it didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it kinda like school for standup?</v>

2156
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2157
01:44:12.691 --> 01:44:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it's exactly like that.</v>

2158
01:44:15.010 --> 01:44:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's classes that I teach is stand up</v>

2159
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:23.710
<v Speaker 2>and the good thing about it is you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you start doing it like whether</v>

2160
01:44:23.711 --> 01:44:26.440
<v Speaker 2>or not they're actually teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is very debatable.</v>

2161
01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:27.803
<v Speaker 4>And the things that they are teaching is</v>
<v Speaker 4>all in ring technique and torches and </v>

2162
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.240
<v Speaker 4>the crumbs are right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that you know,</v>

2163
01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.193
<v Speaker 4>us die hard wrestling fans now miss with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the product is exactly what you </v>

2164

<v Speaker 4>which is psychology cutting promos.</v>

2165
01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.473
<v Speaker 4>I mean he wants to cut a promo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember against hulk hogan where you </v>

2166
01:44:51.271 --> 01:44:54.900
<v Speaker 4>said something like if you plant grass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass will grow.</v>

2167
01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.450
<v Speaker 4>If you plant rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rice will grow.</v>

2168
01:44:57.770 --> 01:45:00.360
<v Speaker 4>And if you plant fear in your opponent's</v>
<v Speaker 4>head,</v>

2169
01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:02.603

2260
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:35.404
<v Speaker 1>my early life about going through all </v>

<v Speaker 1>me get me to a safe place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got it down.</v>

2344
01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.590
<v Speaker 2>What was ultimately what was ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that allowed you to stay clean</v>

2345
01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.610
<v Speaker 2>when you had faltered five or six times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

2346
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:51.623
<v Speaker 2>what was ultimately the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed you to get past all this and </v>

2347
01:54:54.661 --> 01:54:57.030
<v Speaker 2>just to embrace sobriety and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy?</v>

2348
01:54:57.370 --> 01:54:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just</v>

2349
01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:06.340
<v Speaker 1>realizing that I wasn't going to fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time and that came from dallas.</v>

2350
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Not giving up on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2351
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I was scared that he was going to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on me.</v>

2352
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.123
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost like you were failing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would give up on so I can get </v>

2353
01:55:19.371 --> 01:55:21.980
<v Speaker 1>that over with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's going to hurt,</v>

2354
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:23.203
<v Speaker 1>but god damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't deal with this thought of how </v>

2355
01:55:24.441 --> 01:55:25.274
<v Speaker 1>much it's going to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather it hurt right now and you </v>

2356
01:55:27.681 --> 01:55:28.514
<v Speaker 1>kicked me out and then I can go over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and get something that'll make me </v>

2357
01:55:31.191 --> 01:55:32.024
<v Speaker 1>forget about this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always hanging over your head </v>

2358
01:55:33.681 --> 01:55:35.990
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

2359
01:55:35.991 --> 01:55:36.824
<v Speaker 1>when I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how many times I've looked up </v>

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I've chosen this platform of doing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and building so you know,</v>

2450
01:59:36.961 --> 01:59:40.020
<v Speaker 1>because you wouldn't do me any good to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in the building where there's 5,000</v>

2451
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:42.950
<v Speaker 1>people because I can't spend time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of you,</v>

2452
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:44.303
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a 150 in a comedy club will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be five or 10 people that want to talk </v>

2453
01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:51.390
<v Speaker 1>about 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got time for that.</v>

2454
01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was $5,000,</v>

2455
01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd be overwhelmed because not because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the show shows easy.</v>

2456
01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:59.203
<v Speaker 1>He's just fucking memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it out and had some jingles </v>

<v Speaker 1>for it around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2458
02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>say a couple of cute things and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to them.</v>

2459
02:00:06.271 --> 02:00:06.820
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2461
02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>that's where I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2462
02:00:11.581 --> 02:00:12.414
<v Speaker 1>when it's been a good show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go and talk to a couple people </v>

2463
02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>and I can go back to the hotel room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

2464
02:00:19.170 --> 02:00:20.003
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the opposite of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would go back to a hotel room when </v>

2465
02:00:22.621 --> 02:00:23.454

2470
02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.420

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2473
02:00:41.731 --> 02:00:42.564
<v Speaker 1>in the past four years to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still one more miracle left for </v>

2474
02:00:47.101 --> 02:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>me and I hope the hell I meet her soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with all the years of doing steroids.</v>

2517
02:03:23.631 --> 02:03:24.950
<v Speaker 5>The excitement was</v>

<v Speaker 5>having a door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can make them do anything you want.</v>
