<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan said I'm dying.</v>

12
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

13
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.803
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect to a Rhogam but please don't </v>

14
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.600

<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>

15
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>But I read somewhere that blood pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine and I'm,</v>

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.333
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.011
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spiraled out and then.</v>

22
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't get my heart rate up as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was spiraling.</v>

23
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.883
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

24
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally my pulse will be through the </v>

25
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call my doctor.</v>

26
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:52.341
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

27
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

28
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>this is what we've been shooting for if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just stopped drinking.</v>

29
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do what you're doing.</v>

30
00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good time with it,</v>

31
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.183
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my resting heart rate's low.</v>

33
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.763
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt better in my fucking </v>

34
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>life to be dead serious with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many days in or you were 12 days in?</v>

35
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Say the twelfth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one day ahead of that because I quit</v>

36
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the day before I quit the day before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was,</v>

37
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.653
<v Speaker 1>because I listened to you guys and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking armed tier doctors who were </v>

38
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die.</v>

39
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>You need to be medically induced into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coma.</v>

40
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were telling us that you were </v>

41
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>drinking six doubles a day by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk out of my ass when I'm drunk,</v>

43
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how much I was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk because I was dead.</v>

44
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.453
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely terrified coming into </v>

45
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>the homestretch of getting sober because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

46
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.721
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

47
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I going to die?</v>

48
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I literally am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Dr drew about it.</v>

49
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

50
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>can I like die and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

51
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have seizures.</v>

52
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I stopped drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have withdrawals.</v>

54
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It just felt good the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

55
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>It's killed amy winehouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've googled all this shit,</v>

57
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think amy winehouse was just over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

58
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be the second you wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the second you pass out drinking.</v>

59
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

60
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>there on the Australian tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were hints of that.</v>

61
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Like there was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was flying and performing every night </v>

62
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>and I drink on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't flown sober at that time.</v>

63
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>And so there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

64
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.493
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been very measured with my </v>

65
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>boobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wasn't,</v>

66
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.763
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel good when you're doing </v>

67
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:28.274
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you feel when you drink it </v>

68
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.340
<v Speaker 1>in flying and you felt bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt,</v>

69
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I actually felt really bad and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we all tweeted this,</v>

70
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ready for this fucking month after</v>

71
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that Australian tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely ready.</v>

72
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to go into not </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking is flight Australia.</v>

73
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Do a tour for two weeks and then fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

74
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bring it dude.</v>

75
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink that much,</v>

76
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but I feel way better too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

77
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like I would have like maybe a shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I go on stage some nights,</v>

78
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but some nights not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

79
00:02:58.501 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe someone go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want a beer?</v>

80
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.664
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beer may have one or two and then maybe </v>

81
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I'd have a glass of wine with dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

82
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.464
<v Speaker 2>on a regular Friday night I might have </v>
<v Speaker 2>four drinks and now nothing for 12 days </v>

83
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Speaker 2>and no pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went off the pot too because Ari was </v>

84
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.274
<v Speaker 2>giving me such a hard,</v>

85
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.900
<v Speaker 1>your current queer poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not or cuts with roderick.</v>

86
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

87
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I told Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

88
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not tell them and then break it at the,</v>

89
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the month like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy.</v>

90
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>The pots have been easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the dreams have been different.</v>

91
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.123
<v Speaker 2>It is really interesting how when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't smoke pot your dreams like ramp </v>

92
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.930
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think like,</v>

93
00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

94
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>honestly like I just completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

95
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean white death can be good and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be dreaming like right.</v>

96
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Probably something happening.</v>

97
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was my first few days of not drinking,</v>

98
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get out of lucid dreaming who</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

99
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I was having intense lucid dreams where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was well aware I was asleep,</v>

100
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that if I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>

101
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that I was dreaming and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

102
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>don't get out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're having fun.</v>

103
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.553
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

104
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dreaming has been intense by the way</v>

105
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 1>that really my favorite thing is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping good.</v>

106
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Like waking up at six in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and like feel good.</v>

107
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

108
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:15.284
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you like a fucking Uber Fan </v>

109

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

113
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.463
<v Speaker 1>Now I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives me panic when I see him get </v>

114
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>getting coffee for the past year.</v>

117
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>because I start shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get way too blood sugary.</v>

118
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.480

<v Speaker 1>When I got home that night I like,</v>

151
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to see about a cup of </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

152
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Went right to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried</v>

153
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.490

<v Speaker 2>you're sleeping good,</v>

156
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.743
<v Speaker 2>but are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you thinking that this is just a </v>

157
00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:14.190
<v Speaker 2>vacation from your other life or are you</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing your life?</v>

158
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.730
<v Speaker 1>My therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my therapist,</v>

159
00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:16.780
<v Speaker 1>when this started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

160
00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:18.700
<v Speaker 1>do not do this challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really bad idea.</v>

161
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.781
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

162
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.133
<v Speaker 2>asshole therapist you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard this like Christine was mad </v>

164
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:28.661
<v Speaker 2>at him yesterday that my therapist fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this therapist telling him to because</v>

165
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>she's got a good therapist that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>really likes,</v>

166
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you therapist doesn't trust you.</v>

167
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.780
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said.</v>

168
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>He said to me at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

169
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

171
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having any epiphany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had an epiphany,</v>

172
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but epiphany.</v>

173
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm just enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really having a good time.</v>

174
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.313
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I don't know how I'm </v>

175
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 1>gonna get back into drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

176
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:51.610
<v Speaker 1>that's why you shouldn't have done this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to quit drinking,</v>

177
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you should've just done it for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do it out of spite for Tom</v>

178
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Ren Cho spite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun little challenge.</v>

179
00:06:58.421 --> 00:06:58.931
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

180
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do 15 fucking yoga </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes in a month.</v>

181
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing yoga.</v>

182
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.443
<v Speaker 1>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you really want to have an </v>

183
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:08.290
<v Speaker 1>obligation to have to do three a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

185
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I can only work in those parameters.</v>

186
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I can obviously work to the extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when we said no pot,</v>

187
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:17.201
<v Speaker 1>no booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

188
00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool because I'm not going to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot if I'm not drinking booze.</v>

189
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm a teetotaler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I take things too.</v>

190
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.463
<v Speaker 1>I take things to an extreme because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way I can help </v>

191
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:25.984
<v Speaker 1>compartmentalize things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think my question was like at the </v>

192
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.030
<v Speaker 1>end of this month with November first </v>

<v Speaker 1>people fucking insane mobbed and I would</v>

201

<v Speaker 1>they sat me and shit on their show,</v>

<v Speaker 1>childhood or like things that are </v>

211
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.820

<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

212
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Then when they were younger they tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about them traveling together.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think he's handling this the least.</v>

248
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.173
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's struggling like he saying this is </v>

249
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 3>harder for me than any of you.</v>

250
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.913

00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:12.164
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't realize that there's a </v>

349
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:16.760
<v Speaker 1>difference between not drinking on stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a drink with you on stage.</v>

350
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.683
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of a comfort level </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing I can kill this drink and I </v>

351
00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:23.150
<v Speaker 1>don't have to deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like and that first night,</v>

352
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.343
<v Speaker 1>that Saturday night I went home with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>booze for both shows and on that last </v>

353
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:27.771
<v Speaker 1>show I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

354
00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I could use a cocktail and I definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink on stage.</v>

355
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind a cocktail right now.</v>

356
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So you were thinking before that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't drink on stage?</v>

357
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.673
<v Speaker 1>I say I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the truth is I don't mind before </v>

358
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.530
<v Speaker 1>being sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>

359
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.980
<v Speaker 1>But I would say like if you had said so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get drunk on stage?</v>

360
00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:43.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

361
00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:44.144
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I definitely bring drinks on stage </v>

362
00:14:45.681 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>with me and I didn't like it</v>

363
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 4>had a breathalyzer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tests have been on stage.</v>

364
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Was driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd</v>

365
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.770
<v Speaker 3>you get arrested?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

366
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

367
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 3>like a bullet point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

368
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.170
<v Speaker 3>I definitely would go stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

369
00:14:58.171 --> 00:15:01.810
<v Speaker 3>that's number one apology issued a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number two is a treadmill's.</v>

370
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 3>We're not real running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

371
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

372
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 3>you got to come do my course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do the chorus I do with me.</v>

373
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:10.590
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

374
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 3>running hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it's at,</v>

375
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.424
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

376
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 3>let's just say um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really like,</v>

377
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I run on the treadmill all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

378
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.783
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can easily run under a 10 minute mile </v>

379
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.513
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go on the road and my first set of </v>

380
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.850
<v Speaker 3>models was like 12 minute miles and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

381
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.240
<v Speaker 3>I was in pain and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

382
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 3>this is not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got to a 10 minute mile.</v>

383
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feels like a fucking sprint.</v>

384
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get.</v>

385
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Do we show you those treadmills that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>like running?</v>

386
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.330
<v Speaker 3>They're really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

387
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about getting one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

388
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 3>So what I do now is I'm doing some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of deal with them.</v>

389
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the sponsors,</v>

390
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 3>go to rogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rogue athletics.</v>

391
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.133
<v Speaker 3>They're the guys who made the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverse hyper machine that we have in </v>

392
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 3>the back and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually called true form.</v>

393
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull them,</v>

394
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 3>pull this shit out so we could see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like.</v>

395
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.730
<v Speaker 3>But this thing is different because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

396
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.920
<v Speaker 3>you're actually pushing your own body </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

397
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.103
<v Speaker 3>There's no machine behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just got friction to it and it's </v>

398
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.704
<v Speaker 3>got like a slope and you run up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it really is like the closest thing </v>

399
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 3>to running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think actual running is better,</v>

400
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 3>but that is a very close second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to about 5,000</v>

401
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:22.170
<v Speaker 3>bucks.</v>

402
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 3>They're really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tree form hit me so expensive.</v>

403
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.920
<v Speaker 3>They hit you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go.</v>

404
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying hey to form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit me up.</v>

405
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:27.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

406
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 3>true form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll fucking do a free app,</v>

407
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 3>but we do a free ad for you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

408
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 3>who can afford that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of money.</v>

409
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people can,</v>

410
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

411
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:37.544
<v Speaker 3>Some people would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be willing if you had to have one </v>

412
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:42.690
<v Speaker 3>piece of equipment in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

413
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 3>and you budgeted it out 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>

414
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.304
<v Speaker 3>it's probably worth it if you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually use it and get in great shape </v>

415
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.484
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I really feel like the best way to </v>

416
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 3>do it is just go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

417
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:53.354
<v Speaker 3>I think especially if you can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere where there's like a dirt </v>

418
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 3>trail and like a lake to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it more interesting,</v>

419
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.943
<v Speaker 3>but it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been one of the cool things about </v>

420
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:03.960
<v Speaker 3>not drinking and getting out and doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>roadwork is uh,</v>

421
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 3>my wife calls it source energy of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out there and going like,</v>

422
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking beautiful.</v>

423
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Life is really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

424
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.430
<v Speaker 3>I go to the park that were Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe used to live right by this park.</v>

425
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I used to go there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ego.</v>

426
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:15.913
<v Speaker 3>He and A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go to this park every morning we </v>

427
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.374
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my wife will walk it and I run it and </v>

428
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm doing is I'm doing road work</v>

429
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>probably three times a week and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>twice a week I get on the treadmill,</v>

430
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.193
<v Speaker 3>just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrified of injury and then not </v>

431
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:33.240
<v Speaker 3>being able to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't.</v>

432
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 3>And I'm trying to run five days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you worried about?</v>

433
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Like planner or something planned you </v>
<v Speaker 3>had that for awhile?</v>

434
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Plantar fasciitis kit is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dot Shin splints.</v>

435
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.860
<v Speaker 3>My you get it in the middle of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

436
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Like where are you getting that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

437
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 3>like if this is your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right towards the heel.</v>

438
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.681
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

439
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes it'll happen inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the heel and you'll feel it.</v>

440
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Like when your heel touches the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like glass.</v>

441
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 3>When you first started doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you noticing,</v>

442
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 3>we're noticing rather that your foot was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a unstable and that like it hurt,</v>

443
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it hurts your feet to try to balance on </v>
<v Speaker 3>one foot and do the poses.</v>

444
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not notice that per se.</v>

445
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.903
<v Speaker 1>I did notice that what I noticed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that is I've done it is the </v>

446
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>reason I will continue doing hot yoga or</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga in general maybe,</v>

447
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but probably hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like the sweat is um,</v>

448
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.220
<v Speaker 1>my feet are stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Like we're a lot stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

450
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:23.243
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say to Bobby Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to text him and go him and </v>

451
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:25.794
<v Speaker 1>you should start going to hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has the same problem with plantar </v>

452
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:28.434
<v Speaker 1>fasciitis that I do and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really has strengthened my feet and </v>

453
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 1>when I run now I have no pain in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

454
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>

455
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Is Bobby still heavy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

456
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going on a diet.</v>

457
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say to score.</v>

458
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Speaker 1>We should fast shame him and get him </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

459
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that close to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't fuck with them.</v>

461
00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:47.174
<v Speaker 3>I can fuck with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta to know who you could fuck </v>

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.013
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way more interesting and I don't </v>

696
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:16.690
<v Speaker 4>feel bad watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm going to feel bad if this guy</v>

697
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 4>eventually gets a horn through his </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole,</v>

698
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 4>which is probably going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not rooting for the bowl.</v>

699
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm kind of rooting for the bull </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I see matadors not even kind of.</v>

700
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 4>I think bullfighting is completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>retarded.</v>

701
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 4>I think if you want to shoot a bull and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill it and eat it,</v>

702
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.123
<v Speaker 4>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you should do it humanely and you </v>

703
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:35.584
<v Speaker 4>should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you should do it where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

705
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:38.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>

706
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 4>you shoot the ball in the head or </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever you're going to shoot it in the</v>

707
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 4>heart and get it over with.</v>

708
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 4>But they stabbed those things with these</v>
<v Speaker 4>long spears and they poisoned them.</v>

709
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:49.480
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this is to me,</v>

710
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 4>way more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way more brave.</v>

711
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Way More interesting to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

712
00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Which addresses a major concern amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal rights activists.</v>

713
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:03.680
<v Speaker 4>What does the Bulls aren't getting hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't.</v>

714
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.100
<v Speaker 4>This is nonviolent bullfighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

715
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 4>I think we're just watching a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

716
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>So it says a Ole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

717
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 4>this is the guide DPK,</v>
<v Speaker 4>DP Four K dot m.</v>

718
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 4>I follow him on instagram and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical anti,</v>

719
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

720
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti factory farming,</v>

721
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 4>animal rights activists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guy Or girl.</v>

722
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a guy or a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

723
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

724
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 4>his page or this person's page,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her page,</v>

725
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:32.944
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just filled with a animal rights </v>

726
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always animal rights stuff.</v>

727
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.940
<v Speaker 4>We went to a bullfight in Madrid or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Barcelona.</v>

728
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Me and my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we told him we were 22.</v>

729
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 4>We didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were like,</v>

730
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got to go to a bullfight.</v>

731
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Right man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were.</v>

732
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>Both of us were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is really upsetting.</v>

733
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.890
<v Speaker 4>We were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when you'd be like,</v>

734
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But both of us were like,</v>

735
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.160
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed them.</v>

736
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Like it really is up really a sad with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy put up the.</v>

737
00:31:57.191 --> 00:32:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I found out about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this animal rights guy.</v>

738
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.230
<v Speaker 4>And I followed his page because he put </v>
<v Speaker 4>up a,</v>

739
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 4>a picture of a friend of my friend Adam </v>
<v Speaker 4>Green trees in Hawaii,</v>

740
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

741
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.430
<v Speaker 4>because in Australia they hunt feral </v>
<v Speaker 4>cats.</v>

742
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.670
<v Speaker 4>And this guy was holding up a cat like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>house cat.</v>

743
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.543
<v Speaker 4>They shot and killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why they do that is </v>

744
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.104
<v Speaker 4>because feral house cats in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 4>are an invasive species and they are </v>

745
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 4>devastating the local ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They destroy ground nesting birds.</v>

746
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:33.400
<v Speaker 4>They kill everything and there's a large</v>
<v Speaker 4>population of them.</v>

747
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:37.390
<v Speaker 4>They actually have a bounty on feral </v>
<v Speaker 4>cats in Australia.</v>

748
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 4>See they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made some terrible</v>

749
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.173
<v Speaker 2>mistakes with conservation in Australia </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the mistakes they've done </v>

750
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.920
<v Speaker 2>like over and over again is introducing </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive species to the continent.</v>

751
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 2>See Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't the predators in Australia are.</v>

752
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.633
<v Speaker 2>They used to have the Tasmanian tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have dingoes and they have </v>

753
00:32:56.511 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles which are just the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

754
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.044
<v Speaker 2>They ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like serious saltwater </v>

755
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:03.770
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles and then of course sharks on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside.</v>

756
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.113
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they introduced a bunch of animals </v>

757
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 2>to both Australia and New Zealand to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt.</v>

758
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 2>They introduced a fallow deer and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stags and a lot of different things.</v>

759
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Tags and mostly in New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in pigs,</v>

760
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Speaker 2>wild pigs and these fucking things went </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

761
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:21.824
<v Speaker 2>They're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also introduced a bunch of </v>

762
00:33:24.321 --> 00:33:26.750
<v Speaker 2>different like rabbits and things along </v>
<v Speaker 2>those lines.</v>

763
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>And when they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about rabbits,</v>

764
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.923
<v Speaker 2>forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they brought in cats and foxes to </v>

765
00:33:33.231 --> 00:33:34.760
<v Speaker 2>deal with some of the other species.</v>

766
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 2>But then the cats and the foxes don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kill the species.</v>

767
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:39.770
<v Speaker 2>They want them to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking kill all these other things</v>

768
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 2>that had no idea what a cat was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no feral cats there.</v>

769
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And so now they have a real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them where they just,</v>

770
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

771
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they run the risk.</v>

772
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I know this guy who's an animal rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>activist,</v>

773
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 2>his thought is he seeing this monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting someone's pet,</v>

774
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's most likely not someone's pet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's most likely a feral cat.</v>

775
00:33:58.251 --> 00:33:59.084
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of them in </v>

776
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're a giant issue.</v>

777
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

778
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.543
<v Speaker 2>they hire people to kill them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're devastating all these animals </v>

779
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>that had no idea what a cat was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a much more complex issue than a</v>

780
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:15.590
<v Speaker 2>lot of these animal rights activists </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

781
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.200
<v Speaker 2>And I was thrown off because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

782
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.093
<v Speaker 2>Adam Green tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy gave me a bowhunting magazine </v>

783
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:22.634
<v Speaker 2>from Australia when I was there visiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and I was going through it on the </v>

784
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 2>plane and there's pictures of guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding up cats and they shot.</v>

785
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.283
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck is wrong with you </v>

786
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:32.384
<v Speaker 2>Australians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when it's explained to you by </v>

787
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:37.190
<v Speaker 2>someone who lives there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we hate house cats.</v>

788
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.790
<v Speaker 2>These are not house cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like going out and shooting,</v>

789
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bobcat that's been killing all the </v>

790
00:34:44.001 --> 00:34:45.640
<v Speaker 2>local grouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

791
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.483
<v Speaker 2>like if you introduced a cat into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>area that wasn't supposed to be there </v>

792
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.320
<v Speaker 2>and it was devastating all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

793
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:52.243
<v Speaker 2>So you have one of two options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you just let everything go </v>

794
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:54.974
<v Speaker 2>extinct and don't handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you try to clean up the mess that </v>

795
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors sort of started before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like nutria.</v>

796
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutri is a good example.</v>

797
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:03.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:04.784
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking things is giant rat </v>

799
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

800
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.150
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

801
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to take two seconds talking about</v>

802
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Adam Green Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like my new favorite obsession.</v>

803
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 1>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

804
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tweeted out,</v>

805
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch my buddy on this hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we went,</v>

806
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I was in Australia and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my time zones.</v>

807
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:21.704
<v Speaker 1>We're all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was not sleeping and I got </v>

808
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with that hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

809
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Started in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in Montana.</v>

810
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got obsessed with it and it was so </v>

811
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:30.674
<v Speaker 1>much fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he got off the hunt I was </v>

812
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:32.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck,</v>

813
00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'll just wait for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

814
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.460
<v Speaker 1>We'll explain what the thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so low he will backpacking</v>

815
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.100
<v Speaker 4>and he was covering and oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I speak big.</v>

816
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.093
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Views covering like 15 miles a day on </v>

817
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.053
<v Speaker 4>easily easy easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not just a flat walk up mountains </v>

818
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.130
<v Speaker 4>because you gotta you gotta glass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things I'm about to.</v>

819
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I know I'm a hunter from </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching this video.</v>

820
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Every day he would post on his insta </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories and,</v>

821
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.203
<v Speaker 4>and he was looking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he find elk and he was hunting elk and </v>

822
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 4>he would find elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't the one he wanted.</v>

823
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.380
<v Speaker 4>And like he'd see this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I.</v>

824
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.920
<v Speaker 4>he's like six point six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six point.</v>

825
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like six point,</v>

826
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the right one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

827
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 4>They were young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want to shoot a young animal,</v>

828
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.490
<v Speaker 4>do you want her to shoot an old mature </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

829
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 4>and then at one point there was a bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>tracking him and I'm like,</v>

830
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.830

<v Speaker 4>and he was getting.</v>

874
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.020
<v Speaker 4>they'd killed an elk and that's the elk </v>

875
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:22.854
<v Speaker 4>the one with one antler and uh,</v>

876
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.520
<v Speaker 4>fighting and they were cutting this </v>

877
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.950
<v Speaker 4>And then they set it down and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just sitting down eating lunch</v>

878
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have their guns on them.</v>

879
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:39.334
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just were just unprepared and with </v>

<v Speaker 2>And everybody scattered and thank.</v>

883
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.293

<v Speaker 2>but they got as close to death as </v>

884
00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.164
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to me about on the phone </v>

885
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 2>yesterday was telling me that literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>inches away from his face,</v>

886
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.240
<v Speaker 2>he was seeing gnashing teeth like inches</v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

891
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.993
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he like flew to Montana </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't like the hunt in </v>

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.273
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing called onyx maps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could download the maps to your </v>

898
00:39:36.201 --> 00:39:39.260
<v Speaker 2>phone and then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stretch your phone out.</v>

899
00:39:39.261 --> 00:39:40.820
<v Speaker 2>And he was using a solar pad.</v>

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.673
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>

925
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd last one night with Adam who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>

926
00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:39.410
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

927
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in his camp going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

928
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.750
<v Speaker 1>we're not bringing any whiskey out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

929
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to sit here sober and bear's</v>

930
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 1>going to tell you sober right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

931
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

932
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.400
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no drug,</v>

933
00:40:49.401 --> 00:40:50.750
<v Speaker 1>no drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>

934
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

935
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:57.110
<v Speaker 2>his father had a real problem and so he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is averse to it completely.</v>

936
00:40:57.111 --> 00:40:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced alcoholism,</v>

937
00:40:59.751 --> 00:41:03.380
<v Speaker 2>like abusive alcoholism from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents and they have the same feeling.</v>

938
00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:04.830
<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to have anything to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with it.</v>

939
00:41:04.831 --> 00:41:09.080
<v Speaker 2>It's they see how it just wrecks people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in ruins people and I'll tell you man,</v>

940
00:41:09.081 --> 00:41:09.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that way because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed drinking and I've never really </v>

941
00:41:11.811 --> 00:41:14.960
<v Speaker 2>had a terrible thing happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of drinking,</v>

942
00:41:14.961 --> 00:41:19.961
<v Speaker 2>but being sober over these last 12 days </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it's been,</v>

943
00:41:20.931 --> 00:41:21.764
<v Speaker 2>and being in comedy clubs every night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and seeing sloppy drunks like I've seen </v>

944
00:41:25.941 --> 00:41:29.270
<v Speaker 2>three or four like ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the other night at the store,</v>

945
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 2>some fucking unbelievably drunk guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to have a conversation.</v>

946
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Me from like two inches away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

947
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 2>that sloppy drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close talk type thing and I'm like,</v>

948
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.793
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck?</v>

949
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Who does this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sober?</v>

950
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Zero people like this is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst things about alcohol.</v>

951
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:45.434
<v Speaker 2>It's like people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries or how they come off or what </v>

952
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 2>they sound like and there's bad things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

953
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.370
<v Speaker 2>You're a great drunk by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

954
00:41:53.371 --> 00:41:54.204
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like one of my favorite drunks </v>

955
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 2>because you're so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You manage it well.</v>

956
00:41:57.351 --> 00:41:58.880
<v Speaker 2>You're like a black belt and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>

957
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's like with all the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had with your health,</v>

958
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 2>with drinking too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read.</v>

959
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come off like pretty easy.</v>

960
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 2>You're a fun guy to be around when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drinking.</v>

961
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.713
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a problem in that sense </v>

962
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.090
<v Speaker 2>because like we all know like people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drink and then just go,</v>

963
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 2>they go dark and they get mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 2>and they get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that.</v>

965
00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

966
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:23.550
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

967
00:42:23.551 --> 00:42:24.384
<v Speaker 1>I never have had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also part of the problem </v>

968
00:42:25.951 --> 00:42:28.300
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm a good drunk and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoys me and I,</v>

969
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sweet guy and I think that's the </v>

970
00:42:30.841 --> 00:42:31.950
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even my wife's like,</v>

971
00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a problem.</v>

972
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 1>But like the woman's with me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

973
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean she wouldn't be the one to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's like,</v>

974
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but healthwise has changed my health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm six miles in,</v>

975
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.060
<v Speaker 1>under an hour the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

976
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 1>That's fast for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very good.</v>

977
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so health wise,</v>

978
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

979
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.600
<v Speaker 1>That's 18 miles in three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Well I couldn't keep that pace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you did.</v>

981
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

982
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that's really fucking good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 29 minute and 20 miles of a marathon.</v>

983
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Twenty six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost a marathon in four hours.</v>

984
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

985
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a half marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I signed up for a half marathon.</v>

986
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.590
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna sound silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to keep myself on the rails.</v>

987
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose the fitness.</v>

988
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I like food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like feeling good.</v>

989
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I like to think</v>

990
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Straw was my question initially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like you.</v>

991
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.650
<v Speaker 2>This is a sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a change in your lifestyle.</v>

992
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 2>Like it feel like what I'm worried about</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's like you're just going to like,</v>

993
00:43:32.251 --> 00:43:33.420
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>

994
00:43:33.421 --> 00:43:34.254
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt better and now whew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the rails there will be a week of </v>

995
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.613
<v Speaker 2>that planning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was almost like you're planning </v>

996
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.440
<v Speaker 2>to go off the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is just like I'm going to keep</v>

997
00:43:43.441 --> 00:43:44.760
<v Speaker 2>it together for a month and then.</v>

998
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

999
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.453
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Tom and push about this a </v>

1000
00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.930
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I,</v>

1001
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to stop partying but I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want partying to be.</v>

1002
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it got out of control in the </v>

1003
00:43:56.921 --> 00:43:57.754
<v Speaker 1>sense that like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like I get on stage and have a </v>

1004
00:44:01.331 --> 00:44:02.164
<v Speaker 1>cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I drank a soda one time on stage </v>

1005
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.593
<v Speaker 1>and they lost her fucking mind because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't a guild it because they just </v>

1006
00:44:07.451 --> 00:44:08.890
<v Speaker 1>assumed it's whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1007
00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:09.610
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1008
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd like to find a middle ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

1009
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.250
<v Speaker 1>of like where I can go and have a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1010
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to quit drinking on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>

1011
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.200
<v Speaker 1>That's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm focused on this month,</v>

1012
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>no booze on planes and then I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind ski,</v>

1013
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 1>like working out hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think I always say I work out,</v>

1014
00:44:28.181 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but like legit working out is not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing.</v>

1015
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1016
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 3>when you do a 90 minute hot yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize what suffering really is.</v>

1017
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Ten minutes into our first class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

1018
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.600
<v Speaker 3>tom looked over to me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1019
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.460
<v Speaker 3>you can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1020
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.191
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1021
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:44.940
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1022
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.940
<v Speaker 3>10 minute gifts going 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go 15 minutes an hour.</v>

1023
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done,</v>

1024
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do 30 more minutes.</v>

1025
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when we go,</v>

1026
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:57.324
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get on your back and you put </v>

1027
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:58.794
<v Speaker 3>your arms out and tom just reached over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and grabs my hand and holds it tight </v>

1028
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 3>like a lover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1029
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:07.620
<v Speaker 3>get me the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's gotten easier.</v>

1030
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.543
<v Speaker 3>And like things that we couldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can do and we've only been at </v>

1031
00:45:11.421 --> 00:45:14.030
<v Speaker 3>like six classes but we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at it.</v>

1032
00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.240
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're enjoying it more.</v>

1033
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 3>And like everyone knows us because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two big fucking bears in there.</v>

1034
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.413
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tom got in trouble for drinking </v>

1035
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:24.894
<v Speaker 3>water one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't drink water during the poses and </v>

1036
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:28.074
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1155
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 3>and you're supposed to kick your foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1156
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.540
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burt grabbed the bottom of your foot.</v>

00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:57.141
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1158
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she goes,</v>

1159

<v Speaker 3>there's people fatter than you in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>class going because we know that fucker.</v>

1160
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.441
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1161
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:08.060
<v Speaker 3>I have to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will always shit on Tom's.</v>

1162
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's actually looking really good,</v>

1163
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I think is hot yoga is really clicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

1164
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.463
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get much deeper into poses and </v>

1165
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.393
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time getting into deep </v>

1166
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 3>poses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he really has changed his life.</v>

1167
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 3>We weighed the exact same joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1168
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:24.380
<v Speaker 3>but he's probably more muscular than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.913
<v Speaker 3>a lot more skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about them that seems more </v>

1170
00:51:28.611 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 3>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being real.</v>

1171
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 3>You're down to 19 or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were you at?</v>

1172
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 3>The weight loss challenge was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably to 19 to 22.</v>

1173
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.193
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're lighter now and you're not </v>

1174
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:41.414
<v Speaker 3>dehydrating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took total measurements in my body </v>

1175
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 3>because I'm curious to see at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the month everyone said,</v>

1176
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 3>I looked like I'm deflated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look thin,</v>

1177
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.050
<v Speaker 3>my face looks healthier and so I took </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures on my stomach,</v>

1178
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.300
<v Speaker 3>my arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my legs,</v>

1179
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 3>and just to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the shift was.</v>

1180
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I was 2:24.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The day West I stopped drinking.</v>

1181
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.580
<v Speaker 3>What your face looks different like your</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

1182
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:03.980
<v Speaker 3>like you used to have the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been drinking bags,</v>

1183
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you know that a lot of people get six </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash one slash 2:24</v>

1184
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.020
<v Speaker 3>chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>47.</v>

1185
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:11.240
<v Speaker 3>And Are you talking about your Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1186
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.983
<v Speaker 3>So you're doing that at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when you get to the end you're </v>

1187
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:19.660
<v Speaker 3>going to check yourself again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what are you eating?</v>

1188
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.620
<v Speaker 3>You eating healthy or eating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just whatever you want.</v>

1189
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.563
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating healthy for like two thirds </v>

1190
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 3>of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1191
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1192
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 3>like I'm eating really healthy and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>

1193
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I saw this on a podcast you did with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some girl about not intermittent fasting</v>

1194
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:35.120
<v Speaker 3>and fasting for 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 hours.</v>

1195
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's called intermittent fasting and </v>

1196
00:52:36.831 --> 00:52:38.290
<v Speaker 3>doing that I'm doing intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 3>fasting,</v>

1197
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 3>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 is what I think they recommend.</v>

1198
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your last meal is at 5:00</v>

1199
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 3>PM or just eat at 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM and then don't eat until noon.</v>

1200
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 3>I have my last meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that mid at 8:00</v>

1201
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.170
<v Speaker 3>PM last night I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last thing I put my mouth was at apm.</v>

1202
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:55.303
<v Speaker 3>I do seven and nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have dinner at seven and then I don't </v>

1203
00:52:57.501 --> 00:52:58.334
<v Speaker 3>eat until nine in the morning and when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat in the morning I drink butter </v>

1204
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:01.370
<v Speaker 3>coffee.</v>

1205
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:02.203
<v Speaker 3>Like before I work out I just have </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee with grass fed butter and mct </v>

1206
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:06.550
<v Speaker 3>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've been doing that.</v>

1207
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.413
<v Speaker 3>And that's your first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you have that structure saying </v>

1208
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.823
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go 14 hours every day without eating.</v>

1210
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been eating a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say every day,</v>

1211
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six days a week.</v>

1212
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.033
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to do 12 hours every day and then </v>

1213
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:22.244
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do is I drink a two </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge things of water and then that shit </v>

1214
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 3>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I have those.</v>

1215
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1216
00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:31.383
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1217
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to eat healthy in the morning.</v>

1218
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat healthy in the afternoon after </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot yoga.</v>

1219
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucking,</v>

1220
00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot say no to a candy bar.</v>

1221
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know if it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my blood sugar's off probably.</v>

1222
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like,</v>

1223
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I come home and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need fucking something sweet.</v>

1224
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat a really healthy dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1225
00:53:50.011 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 3>that's probably exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1226
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 3>your body is craving glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be.</v>

1227
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I had a score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bars.</v>

1228
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I eat it so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday have so many calories.</v>

1229
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many calories you burn </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 15,</v>

1230
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.330
<v Speaker 3>they say that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven or 15.</v>

1231
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.550
<v Speaker 3>That sounds about right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it depends on the effort.</v>

1232
00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like if you do it 100 percent,</v>

1233
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.820
<v Speaker 3>like I can coast through a class or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do everything at 100 percent.</v>

1234
00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:15.774
<v Speaker 3>And I've done both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the difference in the way I feel at </v>

1235
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 3>the end is significantly different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did one class that was a mix up.</v>

1236
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't bikram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was hot yoga,</v>

1237
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.310
<v Speaker 3>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a little like,</v>

1238
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.620
<v Speaker 3>a little different in that we did all 26</v>
<v Speaker 3>poses,</v>

1239
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.500
<v Speaker 3>but we also did flow in between them.</v>

1240
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was really tough.</v>

1241
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.890
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's the kind of you went </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1242
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:38.724
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to Joe's one because it </v>

1243
00:54:39.811 --> 00:54:43.680
<v Speaker 3>was like downward dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cobra Warrior one,</v>

1244
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Warrior one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warrior two on Wednesdays.</v>

1245
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Do you really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1246
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:49.550
<v Speaker 3>that's my Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a hard fucking class.</v>

1247
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Our class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.580
<v Speaker 3>And then they add humidity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1249
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said just,</v>

1250
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:56.423
<v Speaker 3>I said I walked in those very </v>
<v Speaker 3>competencies with my wife's best friend </v>

1251
00:54:58.770 --> 00:54:59.501
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1252
00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever done hot yoga?</v>

1253
00:55:00.551 --> 00:55:00.901
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1254
00:55:00.901 --> 00:55:02.460
<v Speaker 3>I do back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

1255
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:04.080
<v Speaker 3>we're a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1256
00:55:04.081 --> 00:55:05.110
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1257
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:05.701
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be.</v>

1258
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:07.140
<v Speaker 3>But it's the same poses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1259
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.801
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1260
00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 3>there's some flow in between and we add </v>
<v Speaker 3>humidity.</v>

1261
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.493
<v Speaker 3>So stand by the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make sure you're masked by the </v>

1262
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

1263
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:14.750
<v Speaker 3>So they must have like a humidifier in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the room or something.</v>

1264
00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:15.584
<v Speaker 3>And I guess that's why I was by the door</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was so much hotter in there that </v>

1265

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.390
<v Speaker 2>she gets it from the bartender or some.</v>

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 1>How did I like how like is it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got married younger like,</v>

1608
01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but I just never was into that.</v>

1609
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.263
<v Speaker 2>So you're not a producer who's holding </v>
<v Speaker 2>employment over someone's head and </v>

1610
01:08:55.531 --> 01:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>trying to get them to suck your deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a big difference between having</v>

1611
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.593
<v Speaker 2>unsavory male behavior that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to defend because you're </v>

1612
01:09:04.081 --> 01:09:07.920
<v Speaker 2>trying to get laid versus what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing it.</v>

1613
01:09:07.921 --> 01:09:08.754
<v Speaker 2>When people were furious about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rightly so is predatory behavior by a </v>

1614
01:09:13.681 --> 01:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>person who's in power affecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's employment and career.</v>

1615
01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:18.953
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was talking with Whitney Cummings </v>

1616
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.050
<v Speaker 2>about this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Whitney obviously she's a female</v>

1617
01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.450
<v Speaker 2>prominent actress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>

1618
01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>she's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows and yeah,</v>

1619
01:09:29.371 --> 01:09:30.204
<v Speaker 2>and she knows a lot of these people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was saying what you're not hearing </v>

1620
01:09:32.821 --> 01:09:36.780
<v Speaker 2>is how many women sucked his dick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a big part,</v>

1621
01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.600
<v Speaker 2>sucked his dick and made it into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1622
01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Got like five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was a negotiating tactic.</v>

1623
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>

1624
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>that's how he dated.</v>

1625
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how he got laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like straight up predatory shit.</v>

1626
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:53.610
<v Speaker 2>And then her friend had a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1627
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:57.240
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fucked up about it is not that he</v>

1628
01:09:57.241 --> 01:09:58.021
<v Speaker 2>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1629
01:09:58.021 --> 01:09:58.854
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's also fucked up is that that </v>

1630
01:10:01.171 --> 01:10:02.004
<v Speaker 2>was the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what those guys did before there </v>

1631
01:10:05.251 --> 01:10:06.084
<v Speaker 2>was the internet before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was any accountability at </v>

1632
01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:09.600
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the seventies and the sixties.</v>

1633
01:10:09.601 --> 01:10:10.434
<v Speaker 2>Like that is what all of those guys did </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what they did like in a lot </v>

1634
01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:15.114
<v Speaker 2>of those starlets that that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to pay to play and that's what they </v>

1635
01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.310
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had to fuck these guys.</v>

1636
01:10:20.311 --> 01:10:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Like that's literally how it all went </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1637
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.760
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1638
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.673
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that whenever I got </v>

1639
01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>something like Elliot Gould and I did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot together and he left his number in</v>

1640
01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my dressing room,</v>

1641
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.810
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should go to dinner one night.</v>

1642
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:33.531
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1643
01:10:33.531 --> 01:10:34.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to fuck him.</v>

1644
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And I kept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1645
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.273
<v Speaker 1>I kept dodging him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept dodging him and he'd call and be </v>

1646
01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:40.690
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bird,</v>

1647
01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:41.523
<v Speaker 1>it's elliot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still would like to take you to a </v>

1648
01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 1>seafood dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1649
01:10:44.111 --> 01:10:44.944
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we went to seafood dinner down </v>

1650
01:10:47.111 --> 01:10:47.944
<v Speaker 1>in Venice and it was just dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really nice and we talked about </v>

1651
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.620
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really sweet guy.</v>

1652
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Even at the end of the night I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna.</v>

1653
01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:56.884
<v Speaker 1>Try to kiss me or anything.</v>

1654
01:10:58.540 --> 01:10:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Birds,</v>

1655
01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:01.930
<v Speaker 1>not really into bears.</v>

1656
01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:05.350
<v Speaker 1>and then randomly I saw him like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later or maybe more than that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So that's Kinda,</v>

1704
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not the same thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment,</v>

1705
01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:51.530
<v Speaker 2>but as there's this thing of the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>over you,</v>

1706

<v Speaker 2>the power to like literally hold your </v>
<v Speaker 2>career hostage,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That black.</v>

1709

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people have you heard were </v>

1710
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.830
<v Speaker 2>blackballed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1711
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.843
<v Speaker 2>You always hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always see like Brett Butler was </v>

1712
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.070
<v Speaker 2>blackballed member just to be grace </v>
<v Speaker 2>under fire.</v>

1713

1714
01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Then you end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1715
01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:13.484
<v Speaker 1>let's just talk about the side stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd hear about Brett Butler that they </v>

1716
01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:17.810
<v Speaker 1>share when you were young and you'd go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a meeting.</v>

1717
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to turn into Brett </v>
<v Speaker 1>Butler.</v>

1718
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Stay sitting on locking yourself up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

1719
01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:23.270
<v Speaker 1>throwing oranges at everybody.</v>

1720
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:25.220
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk about it.</v>

1721
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:27.050

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1722
01:13:27.051 --> 01:13:27.884
<v Speaker 1>Kind of crazy person that's propeller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met Brett Butler doing good morning </v>

1723
01:13:30.201 --> 01:13:31.034
<v Speaker 1>America one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was the sweetest person in the </v>

1724
01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:32.980
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1725
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.810
<v Speaker 2>She went through some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

1726
01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:36.710
<v Speaker 2>She's been pretty open about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1727
01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:41.260
<v Speaker 2>and she did Charlie Sheen's newer show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the newer show and in the newer show,</v>

1728
01:13:41.261 --> 01:13:43.270
<v Speaker 2>like she was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was part of the premise,</v>

1729
01:13:43.271 --> 01:13:46.300
<v Speaker 2>like she was a bartender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of alluding to the fact that</v>

1730
01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:47.134
<v Speaker 2>she'd made some gigantic mistakes and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of like a play to her to who </v>

1731
01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.300
<v Speaker 2>she actually was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was on that show,</v>

1732
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:59.770
<v Speaker 2>grace under fire and Chuck Lorre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same guy that did two and a half men</v>

1733
01:13:59.771 --> 01:14:00.604
<v Speaker 2>with Charlie Sheen was the guy running </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and she didn't really drink in his </v>

1734
01:14:02.891 --> 01:14:06.610
<v Speaker 2>face and said something horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty.</v>

1735
01:14:06.611 --> 01:14:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to misquote,</v>

1736
01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 2>but it was something along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1737
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.540
<v Speaker 2>wonder why your life left you if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>write like this.</v>

1738
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Something along those.</v>

1739
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 2>What really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1742
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.053
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people lose their fucking mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go from being no one to like </v>

1743
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 2>in a short amount of time being the </v>
<v Speaker 2>star.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's Roseanna.</v>

1745
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne talked about it when she was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast,</v>

1746
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:35.020

1752
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:48.040

<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1753
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:49.570
<v Speaker 2>I went crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this giant Sitcom.</v>

1757
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 2>That was like at the time when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Roseanne.</v>

1758
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 2>What was it like for channels?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1759
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:06.230
<v Speaker 2>and that was a legit show show.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're redoing the.</v>

1762
01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I know the executive producer buddies </v>
<v Speaker 2>was producing it.</v>

1763
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.711
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:15:23.821 --> 01:15:26.350

<v Speaker 2>killers.</v>

1771
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.303
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Roseanne is in a position that you </v>

1772
01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:33.784
<v Speaker 2>and I will never be in because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even possible to be in that position </v>

1773
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:38.104
<v Speaker 2>anymore because there's so many more </v>
<v Speaker 2>stars now because there's so many more </v>

<v Speaker 2>Think about all the different </v>

1789
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:15.130
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the different youtube stars,</v>

1790
01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:18.070
<v Speaker 2>all the different cable shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the different.</v>

1791
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many netflix show,</v>

1792
01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 2>so many standup specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>

1793
01:16:23.231 --> 01:16:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Now the star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was one of maybe 20 stars.</v>

1794
01:16:27.461 --> 01:16:29.520
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's 20,000.</v>

1795
01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:32.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is enough,</v>

1796
01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.253
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the Hubris is still rides </v>

1797
01:16:35.141 --> 01:16:35.741
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1798
01:16:35.741 --> 01:16:36.574
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm guilty of it at times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can get carried away and also </v>

1799
01:16:39.371 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 2>the pressure of a show rides on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>back too.</v>

1800
01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing to take into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>

1801
01:16:43.241 --> 01:16:44.074
<v Speaker 2>You have all these other people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you and they all have their own </v>

1802
01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:46.954
<v Speaker 2>little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're fucking with you and it </v>

1803
01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:54.330
<v Speaker 2>erodes your own concentration and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own vision and sometimes like,</v>

1804
01:16:54.431 --> 01:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1805
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.380
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my fucking show.</v>

1806
01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.500
<v Speaker 2>It's the Bert Kreischer experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's shocked off.</v>

1807
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up.</v>

1808
01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Give me a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1809
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it all starts.</v>

1810
01:17:07.571 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably</v>

1811
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.940
<v Speaker 4>what happened with Charlie Sheen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1812
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 4>it's probably what happens with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people.</v>

1813
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 4>They just get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get whacked out.</v>

1814
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:17.163
<v Speaker 4>And I think also there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing that happens too when </v>

1815
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:20.744
<v Speaker 4>you do a bad show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a particular type of off the rails </v>

1816
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 4>when you know you're doing an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsatisfying bad show.</v>

1817
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:28.690
<v Speaker 4>And I think that was one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was happening to Charlie Sheen News</v>

1818
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.840
<v Speaker 4>on two and a half men because that was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad show and he was a great actor.</v>

1819
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Platoon treat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean go back and look at his,</v>

1820
01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.513
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his catalog of films that he was in </v>

1821
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.823
<v Speaker 4>amazing movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie Sheen was legit and then all of </v>

1822
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:43.304
<v Speaker 4>a sudden he's delivering these lucky </v>
<v Speaker 4>punchlines to a canned laff machine and </v>

1823
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.600
<v Speaker 4>he's just doing blow and he's got HIV </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's just fucking.</v>

1824
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1825
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.990
<v Speaker 4>how do you even get HIV?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he might be the.</v>

1826
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.700
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he got it through straight sex,</v>

1827
01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 4>he might be the only guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>

1828
01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:05.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally who else?</v>

1829
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:09.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say Tommy Morrison,</v>

1830
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard some things.</v>

1831
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

1832
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 4>who knows what people are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

1833
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.820
<v Speaker 4>But it ain't a whole lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tiny little handful.</v>

1834
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.640
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a bit about it really.</v>

1835
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:23.910
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they say sam,</v>

<v Speaker 4>than cancer was.</v>

1863
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.963
<v Speaker 4>So they stopped giving it to cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>patients and there was a lot of like </v>

1864
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 4>real confusing when aids first came </v>

<v Speaker 4>some story in Boston about some </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists was trying to say that aids </v>

1867

1869
01:19:55.521 --> 01:19:57.410
<v Speaker 4>when it first burst on the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 4>1993 and I was shitting my pants.</v>

1873
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about every</v>

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.553
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean halfway for me it was like </v>

1953
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>probably nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it.</v>

1954
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.110
<v Speaker 1>He probably probably about an inch.</v>

1955
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes in and swabs it and as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1956
01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:53.471
<v Speaker 1>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1957
01:22:53.471 --> 01:22:54.940
<v Speaker 1>grab onto the side of the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hurt.</v>

1958
01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1959
01:22:56.921 --> 01:23:00.230
<v Speaker 1>she's a whore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a whore.</v>

1960
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I had a girlfriend and went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She went to spring break,</v>

1961
01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.200
<v Speaker 1>came back with rug burn on her back</v>

1962
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:07.870
<v Speaker 4>or lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1963
01:23:07.871 --> 01:23:08.704
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just gave me some cockamamie story </v>

1964
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.300
<v Speaker 4>about she was drinking and she rubbed up</v>
<v Speaker 4>against a nail.</v>

1965
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:16.030
<v Speaker 4>She was drinking and leaning up against </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fence.</v>

1966
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Like you rubbed up against a nail over </v>
<v Speaker 4>your lower.</v>

1967
01:23:17.941 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1968
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>back what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will bear.</v>

1969
01:23:19.121 --> 01:23:19.954
<v Speaker 1>Just a drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to beat a scratch up your </v>

1970
01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 1>lower back on a nail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was the dumbest excuse ever.</v>

1971
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:32.854
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1972
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:33.963
<v Speaker 1>Oh I that same girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to New Orleans to Mardi gras </v>

1973
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>houses with my buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Mark Osborne.</v>

1974
01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I was with my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my buddies.</v>

1975
01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.933
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time I ever did coke </v>
<v Speaker 1>were all partying and having a great </v>

1976
01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:44.080
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1981
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.653
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to cheat on her and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we run into her and she was covered in </v>

1982
01:23:52.391 --> 01:23:53.224

1985

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took notes to just give them the </v>

1986

1988
01:24:04.651 --> 01:24:05.484
<v Speaker 1>your system to get those like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so much more grateful for my wife </v>

1989
01:24:09.061 --> 01:24:12.330
<v Speaker 1>because she's not that type of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I had those books.</v>

1990
01:24:12.331 --> 01:24:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Good to lower your expectations too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because imagine if you married your high</v>

1991
01:24:15.601 --> 01:24:17.730
<v Speaker 1>school sweetheart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You met when you were 16.</v>

1992
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:19.890
<v Speaker 1>You fell in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She broke your virginity,</v>

1993
01:24:19.891 --> 01:24:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you broke hers,</v>

1994
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.170

<v Speaker 4>home and she's getting gorilla.</v>

1995
01:24:24.171 --> 01:24:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Fuck her personal trainer who looks like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Emmett Smith.</v>

1996
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:31.280
<v Speaker 4>He's just stuffing her in the corner of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a couch and just fucking hammering it.</v>

1997
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.860
<v Speaker 4>You walk in the house,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It smelled like pussy and ass holes in </v>

<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>

<v Speaker 4>And you hear and she's like</v>

2001
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.640
<v Speaker 1>making a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never heard.</v>

2002
01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.490
<v Speaker 4>You walk in the room right when he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just interface.</v>

2003
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the heartbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see now,</v>

2004
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.700
<v Speaker 4>like having gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened to me,</v>

2005
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:00.150
<v Speaker 4>there's a girl that I was dating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've heard like kind of.</v>

2006
01:25:00.151 --> 01:25:00.984
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we weren't like boyfriend and </v>

2007
01:25:02.821 --> 01:25:03.654
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we were definitely having sex at </v>

2008
01:25:05.131 --> 01:25:10.131
<v Speaker 4>fooling around and I think I was 17 at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time and she was 16 and she,</v>

2009
01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:13.993
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to have a paper route or I'd get </v>

2010
01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:19.770
<v Speaker 4>up in the morning and deliver papers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would deliver papers every day,</v>

2011
01:25:19.771 --> 01:25:23.310
<v Speaker 4>365 days a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was up at 4:00</v>

2012
01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:25.560
<v Speaker 4>in the morning on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sunday was the big day.</v>

2013
01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.530
<v Speaker 4>So Saturday night people are out </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking.</v>

2014
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.393
<v Speaker 4>They're still out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting up in the morning and I'm </v>

2015
01:25:30.601 --> 01:25:31.200
<v Speaker 4>leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2016
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.130
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it avoided a lot of nonsense in my life.</v>

2017
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Like as far as partying when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>younger,</v>

2018
01:25:37.381 --> 01:25:39.580
<v Speaker 4>I've barely party when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>

2019
01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.913
<v Speaker 4>barely jealous because I was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was fighting and I was getting up in </v>

2020
01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:45.450
<v Speaker 4>the morning and delivering newspapers.</v>

2021
01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:48.900
<v Speaker 4>So those two things just knocked out all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the booze I gives a few moment,</v>

2022
01:25:48.901 --> 01:25:49.734
<v Speaker 4>like one or two times at parties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a handful of times maybe I drank and </v>

2023
01:25:52.621 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 4>smoked a joint or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sony.</v>

2024
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:58.080
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time squeaky clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just worried about,</v>

2025
01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.093
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being hung over and getting my ass </v>

2026
01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:02.490
<v Speaker 4>kicked and training and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2027
01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 4>it was a fucked childhood but we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked out.</v>

2028
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get up at 4:00</v>

2029
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.820
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and go deliver </v>
<v Speaker 4>newspapers.</v>

2030
01:26:07.821 --> 01:26:08.654
<v Speaker 4>I go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This girl that I was dating is making </v>

2031
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:13.640
<v Speaker 4>out with one of my friends in the front </v>
<v Speaker 4>seat of a car.</v>

2032
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:14.803
<v Speaker 4>They're both fucked up right in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my house because the guy was my friend </v>

2033
01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:20.114
<v Speaker 4>who was also friends with my sister and </v>
<v Speaker 4>my sister was friends with the girl and </v>

2034
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 4>so the two of them were small town </v>
<v Speaker 4>Newton,</v>

2035
01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:29.370
<v Speaker 4>upper falls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We lived in a small town just outside of</v>

2036
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Boston and they're making out right in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of my house.</v>

2037
01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:33.463
<v Speaker 4>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2038
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:36.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm awake sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at them.</v>

2039
01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:37.244
<v Speaker 4>They're probably drunk during the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grabbing tits and Dicks and shit like </v>

2040
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:44.170

<v Speaker 4>hood and what,</v>

2041
01:26:46.770 --> 01:26:51.310
<v Speaker 4>and they both looked at me and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>got in the car and drove off.</v>

2042
01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:52.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:45.843
<v Speaker 4>But she was just clearly knowing that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted it and just deciding not to and </v>

2067
01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:53.010
<v Speaker 4>just was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I've.</v>

2068
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.970
<v Speaker 4>That was a super valuable lesson of </v>
<v Speaker 4>being like a needy Weirdo,</v>

2069
01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.233
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when you're 18 you're so needy </v>

2070
01:28:01.211 --> 01:28:05.080
<v Speaker 4>and just you can be annoying and if one </v>
<v Speaker 4>person wants something too much it turns</v>

2071
01:28:05.081 --> 01:28:06.580
<v Speaker 4>the other person off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2072
01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.414
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes this weird little thing that </v>

2073
01:28:08.651 --> 01:28:09.370
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

2074
01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to segue into a very creepy area,</v>

2075
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.033
<v Speaker 1>but like Eric saying that saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been going through this a little </v>

2076
01:28:17.231 --> 01:28:18.064
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My oldest daughter is starting to grow </v>

2077
01:28:19.991 --> 01:28:24.991
<v Speaker 1>up and she doesn't need us as much as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2078
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.510
<v Speaker 1>it goes from being like this little girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just everything,</v>

2079
01:28:28.511 --> 01:28:29.590
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go on a bike ride,</v>

<v Speaker 1>until like,</v>

2082
01:28:31.961 --> 01:28:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Hey George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go on a bike ride.</v>

2083
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:34.150

<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

2085
01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's when it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hormones,</v>

2087
01:28:38.381 --> 01:28:39.214
<v Speaker 1>it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I naturally tend to that needy </v>

2088
01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:44.770
<v Speaker 1>guy like of going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said to my wife,</v>

2089
01:28:44.771 --> 01:28:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not handling this properly because I</v>

2090
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:48.730
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get angry.</v>

01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2092
01:28:50.051 --> 01:28:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Like I called her the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go after the,</v>

2093
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 1>after the rams game I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2094

2095
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2096
01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:57.880
<v Speaker 1>she was like 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

2097
01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:00.400
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the first I'm hearing of this.</v>

2098
01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:00.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a school night.</v>

2102

<v Speaker 1>It's an early night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should probably.</v>

2103
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:07.051
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2104
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:07.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2105
01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:08.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2106
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Like she just wants her distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wants to be home like reading a book</v>

2107
01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.400
<v Speaker 1>or she wants her own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

2108
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 1>She wants to be able to control her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2109
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:16.943
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a dad's book out there</v>

2111
01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:24.171
<v Speaker 1>of like how you deal with your child not</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be around you.</v>

2112
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:26.303
<v Speaker 1>Like she asked me to can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to do this thing where I dropped </v>

2113
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:29.370
<v Speaker 1>them off and then I just yell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

2114
01:29:29.371 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Until they couldn't hear me anymore.</v>

2115
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Like until they were far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just go,</v>

2116

<v Speaker 1>I love you and I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

2117
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And like other kids be staring at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said to me the other day,</v>

2118
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:38.881
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2120
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2121
01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:42.894
<v Speaker 1>You don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2122
01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:43.763
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's kids that don't know me that </v>

2123
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>don't know that it's a joke and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be better if you didn't do that.</v>

2124
01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:48.923
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

<v Speaker 1>little girl and I was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But there is this needy dude in me that </v>

2134
01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like it's part of a breakup.</v>

2135
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.083
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go into a breakup and you love </v>

2136
01:30:15.601 --> 01:30:17.790
<v Speaker 1>someone they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need my space.</v>

2137
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anymore or something?</v>

2140
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And you start panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2141
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I started having that with my daughter </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said to my wife,</v>

2142
01:30:25.471 --> 01:30:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2143
01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not processing her </v>

2144
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:29.161
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2147
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:35.460
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she doesn't know that she needs me.</v>

2148
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.473
<v Speaker 1>She wants and totally healthy for her to</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish yourself as your own person </v>

2149
01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and do own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2150
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.313
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I all I can see is this just going to </v>

2151
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Speaker 1>get harder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2152
01:30:45.121 --> 01:30:45.954
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing to take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration that you really can't fix </v>

2153
01:30:47.731 --> 01:30:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's you're on the road a lot.</v>

2154
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2155
01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:50.934
<v Speaker 1>when kids are not around you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and then when you're there you're </v>

2156
01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:54.090
<v Speaker 1>really overbearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2157
01:30:54.091 --> 01:30:54.924
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm used to my own space and now you're </v>

2158
01:30:57.031 --> 01:31:00.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking with me and you're yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you at school and stop,</v>

2159
01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.190
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ruining my thing.</v>

2160
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on my thing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping in and fucking it up.</v>

2161
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2162
01:31:08.101 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2163
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:09.781
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2164
01:31:09.781 --> 01:31:10.614
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about the product I put </v>

2165
01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:12.264
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's videos of me </v>

2166
01:31:13.621 --> 01:31:15.410
<v Speaker 1>and speedos or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2167
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure that there's kids in our </v>

2168
01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 1>school that have googled me and he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or like,</v>

2169
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.633
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what kind of footprint I</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave behind that she's got to sweep up </v>

2170
01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:28.074
<v Speaker 1>and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never thought about that shit </v>

2171
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.833
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm starting to realize it and </v>

2172
01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

2173
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end of the day,</v>

2174
01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Georgia goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the six,</v>

2177
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2178
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.903
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to watch that and we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting about it and I just want us to </v>

2179
01:31:43.501 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 1>be together as a family stone sober </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

2180
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.630
<v Speaker 1>and I have a moment of fucking honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2181
01:31:48.631 --> 01:31:50.040
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I fucked things up.</v>

2182
01:31:50.041 --> 01:31:51.510
<v Speaker 1>So I was on the road for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2183
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I should've never done </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel channel.</v>

2184
01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I will always feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will always feel that regret,</v>

2185
01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:59.140
<v Speaker 1>but these are the moments that I need in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life where we can all be a family and</v>

2186
01:31:59.141 --> 01:32:00.880
<v Speaker 1>if you guys don't want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was gone for so long,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2188
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:03.303
<v Speaker 1>But understand that if someone could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just give an inch so that we can just </v>

2189
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>hang out and watch this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would mean a lot to me.</v>

2190
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to store,</v>

2191
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back in.</v>

2192
01:32:12.281 --> 01:32:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Georgia just pops up and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to the store with you.</v>

2193
01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And I was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2194
01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to go to the store.</v>

2196
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So we go to the store together and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't handle it though.</v>

2197
01:32:22.991 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2198
01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.550

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2199
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Kevin can acknowledge that maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't ideal and that's a great thing,</v>

2200
01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:31.474
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have that kind of honesty because </v>

2201
01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>that's a great lesson to your kid that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2202
01:32:34.691 --> 01:32:37.480
<v Speaker 2>like if you have made mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't pretend you haven't,</v>

2203
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 2>don't gloss over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talk about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like talk about your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

2205
01:32:41.621 --> 01:32:42.454

<v Speaker 2>frustrated by the way we were raised in </v>

2206
01:32:44.231 --> 01:32:45.064
<v Speaker 2>that regard that your parents never </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody ever saying they did anything </v>

2207
01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:49.084
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

2208
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:51.490
<v Speaker 2>ever know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never.</v>

2209
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 2>My Dad never once said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry they didn't say that,</v>

2210
01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 2>didn't nobody said that back then kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up and go outside.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you heard.</v>

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody taught you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

2213
01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like what you did.</v>

2214
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Parents went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our parents went to work rather.</v>

2215
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:06.663
<v Speaker 2>And you went to school and then when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got home from school there was nobody </v>

2216
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a key.</v>

2217
01:33:10.050 --> 01:33:13.390
<v Speaker 2>You let yourself in the house and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking figured it out.</v>

2218

<v Speaker 1>Mine was a frog in a hole where you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hole in the bread and put an egg in </v>

2222
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the bread and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>flip it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You ever had that?</v>

2229
01:33:37.871 --> 01:33:38.704
<v Speaker 1>center out of bread and then you crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>an egg and you do an egg inside that </v>

2230
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 1>center and you let it grill and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip it over.</v>

2231
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I really want a glass of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2277
01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:27.920
<v Speaker 1>have one who gives a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one.</v>

2278
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.233
<v Speaker 1>So I have a glass of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a couple glasses of wine and we go </v>

2279
01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:31.304
<v Speaker 1>out and we get lost in the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venice and we're just hopping in Barda </v>

2280
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:34.633
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a glass of wine and then walking </v>

2281
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:38.690
<v Speaker 1>around one of the best nights of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking life.</v>

2282
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

2283
01:35:39.861 --> 01:35:40.694
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol.</v>

2284
01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Well isn't it different though in Italy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy's really nice in that regard.</v>

2285
01:35:46.631 --> 01:35:47.464
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a more relaxed atmosphere </v>

2286
01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:52.840
<v Speaker 2>like at restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places that you go,</v>

2287
01:35:52.841 --> 01:35:54.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like a different feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2288
01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:55.840
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2289
01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.020
<v Speaker 2>we are making a mistake with the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live our lives,</v>

2290
01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:00.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the pressure that to </v>

2291
01:36:02.021 --> 01:36:02.854
<v Speaker 2>succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hustle and bustle that people have </v>

2292
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:05.703
<v Speaker 2>is not counterbalanced in this country </v>
<v Speaker 2>by relaxation and enjoyment and like </v>

2293
01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:14.731
<v Speaker 2>family time and like a nice long meal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and appreciating the rest.</v>

2294
01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:16.173
<v Speaker 2>We don't appreciate the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We appreciate a person who sleeps three </v>

2295
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:20.920
<v Speaker 2>hours a night and fucking just hustling </v>
<v Speaker 2>all day long.</v>

2296
01:36:20.921 --> 01:36:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Constantly hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hustling.</v>

2297
01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:25.930
<v Speaker 2>There's something to hard work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hustle.</v>

2298
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:28.270
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be counterbalanced and</v>

2299
01:36:28.271 --> 01:36:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I always feel that when I go to Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've gone to Italy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>food and relaxation and you're at the </v>

2302

<v Speaker 2>And it's like my whole being just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just feel likes all the bullshit just </v>

2305
01:36:50.861 --> 01:36:51.694
<v Speaker 2>goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't pay attention to the </v>

2306
01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.390

<v Speaker 2>I don't pay attention to shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>While you're relaxing,</v>

2326

2328
01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 2>You've got to leave it in the room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the safe.</v>

2329
01:38:01.321 --> 01:38:02.154
<v Speaker 2>You got to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta just not pay </v>

<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

2331
01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:07.014
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to let go and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken me a while to learn how to do </v>

2332
01:38:09.511 --> 01:38:10.344
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

2333
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not moving forward,</v>

2334
01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you're falling behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2335
01:38:14.011 --> 01:38:16.110
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always been my thought process.</v>

2336
01:38:16.111 --> 01:38:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I have this fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like aggressive,</v>

2337
01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 2>competitive thought process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do more than the next guy.</v>

2338
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.570
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not always the case,</v>

2339
01:38:24.571 --> 01:38:25.404
<v Speaker 2>especially in our business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so dependent upon creativity </v>

2340
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:32.010
<v Speaker 2>and the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think your mind like you want to,</v>

2341
01:38:32.011 --> 01:38:34.200
<v Speaker 2>you want your mind to be in a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2342
01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like if you're in it,</v>

2343
01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.153
<v Speaker 2>my mind is always in the best place when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have good relationships with my </v>

2344
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:41.280
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

2345
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>that's where my mind is in the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2346
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:44.003
<v Speaker 2>That's the most important shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivate that as the most important </v>

2347
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:47.004
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of times we think the most </v>

2348
01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:49.610
<v Speaker 2>important thing is like financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

2349
01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 2>The most important thing is this or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2350
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:53.820
<v Speaker 2>These things get that in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2351
01:38:53.821 --> 01:38:54.654
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna get a new house so we're </v>

2352
01:38:55.771 --> 01:38:58.200
<v Speaker 2>going to get a new thing or this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2353
01:38:58.201 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 2>But that's how bullshit like those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things aren't bad to,</v>

2354
01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 2>to have or to as a goal.</v>

2355
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:08.050
<v Speaker 2>But clearly your base has got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2356
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I hate to sound Corny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be things matters of the</v>

2357
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:11.934
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be friends and loved ones </v>

2358
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:14.784
<v Speaker 2>and family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be your children and your </v>

2359
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:18.390
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your mom and your,</v>

2360
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.673
<v Speaker 2>your the people that you care about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet those people like have good times </v>

2361
01:39:23.401 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 2>with those people like happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2362
01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:28.530
<v Speaker 2>You have to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do not have that,</v>

2363
01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:29.364
<v Speaker 2>all that other stuff is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have friends that love you </v>

2364
01:39:31.951 --> 01:39:32.784
<v Speaker 2>and you love them and you like </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately happy to see them and you </v>

2365
01:39:35.431 --> 01:39:36.264
<v Speaker 2>have laughed together and fun together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all the money in the world won't </v>

2366
01:39:39.571 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>mean anything to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be zero.</v>

2367
01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:48.190
<v Speaker 2>You will have a zero happiness register.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will register zero pleasure for many</v>

2368
01:39:49.801 --> 01:39:54.801
<v Speaker 2>financial success if you know you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your best friends hate each other.</v>

2369
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:57.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you can't have that.</v>

2370
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:59.090
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not what light,</v>

2371
01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:00.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of selfish people lose track </v>

2372
01:40:02.101 --> 01:40:02.934
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand how important the </v>

2373
01:40:04.591 --> 01:40:06.940
<v Speaker 2>tribe is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how important community is.</v>

2374
01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't at all.</v>

2375
01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that at all up until</v>
<v Speaker 1>this month.</v>

2376

<v Speaker 1>This month.</v>

<v Speaker 4>back on Sunday.</v>

2407
01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>

2408
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:27.573
<v Speaker 4>I'm not touring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go somewhere for 30 </v>

2409
01:41:29.411 --> 01:41:30.140
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>

2410
01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

2411
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that.</v>

2412
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I am doing that coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But are you going to do.</v>

2413
01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing two tours this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's like a legit one.</v>

2414
01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 1>The first ones I think starting in June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the call in sick to work tour and I</v>

2415
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>think I'm going to do it with two other </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>

2416
01:41:44.571 --> 01:41:47.810
<v Speaker 1>We had a tour bus and we're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>some venues.</v>

2417
01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Did you organize it already?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2418
01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the process world.</v>

2419
01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've already decided that two weeks</v>

2420
01:41:54.211 --> 01:41:55.290
<v Speaker 4>a month is better?</v>

2421
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2422
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.843
<v Speaker 1>because I don't do what you guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and Tom tour very differently </v>

2423
01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:05.040
<v Speaker 1>than I do because you guys are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters so you can add shows and it's,</v>

2424
01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal and you're getting a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more bang for your buck.</v>

2425
01:42:09.141 --> 01:42:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I think when you do a theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still doing clubs.</v>

2426
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the money's probably in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money's d.</v>

2427
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.823
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a higher percentage but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be there fucking Wednesday </v>

2428
01:42:18.141 --> 01:42:19.160
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>

2429
01:42:19.161 --> 01:42:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>

2430
01:42:20.061 --> 01:42:20.894
<v Speaker 1>Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly home Monday and those just add up </v>

2431
01:42:23.631 --> 01:42:26.720
<v Speaker 1>into like fucking because you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2432
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2433
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2434
01:42:29.751 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 1>But you stopped doing Wednesdays in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties?</v>

2435
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:32.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday.</v>

2436
01:42:32.841 --> 01:42:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I fly in Wednesday to do press on </v>

2437
01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:35.423

<v Speaker 1>But I feel grateful for those places </v>

2438
01:42:37.731 --> 01:42:38.564
<v Speaker 1>that had me in when I wasn't selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets and so I know what you're </v>

2439
01:42:40.371 --> 01:42:40.640
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2440
01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.080

<v Speaker 1>but I go can elliot's my buddy he's been</v>

<v Speaker 1>supporting my whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be there for Thursday morning </v>

2442
01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:49.670
<v Speaker 1>pressed with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very nice of you.</v>

2443
01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.560
<v Speaker 1>That's very nice of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's bad for your health.</v>

2444
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:53.083
<v Speaker 1>Very bad for your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you call in call in when you're on </v>

2445
01:42:55.311 --> 01:42:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'd like to do is like,</v>

2446
01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and get some of my friends,</v>

2447
01:42:59.481 --> 01:43:03.410
<v Speaker 1>get on a tour bus and not kill myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the travel and do you know,</v>

2448
01:43:03.411 --> 01:43:08.210
<v Speaker 1>like straight out 14 dates or 10 dates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the tour,</v>

2449
01:43:08.211 --> 01:43:10.130
<v Speaker 1>make some money and then go and be at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the store and.</v>

2450
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because that's what you guys do.</v>

2451
01:43:12.261 --> 01:43:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never do the straight tours.</v>

2452
01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:16.133
<v Speaker 1>You have the straight tour.</v>

2453
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:18.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like them.</v>

2454
01:43:18.441 --> 01:43:20.150
<v Speaker 4>They wear you out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always tired.</v>

2455
01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.850
<v Speaker 4>You wake up in the morning like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get to the gym,</v>

2456
01:43:22.851 --> 01:43:23.930
<v Speaker 4>get to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get something to eat.</v>

2457
01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:26.240
<v Speaker 4>How many more hours before the show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hours.</v>

2458
01:43:26.241 --> 01:43:29.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna try to take a nap and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>always wind up being worn out.</v>

2459
01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.630
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing that I don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

2460
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel happy when I'm home more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2461
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:38.090
<v Speaker 4>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

2462
01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:41.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't like I can't go 30 days.</v>

2463
01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't do 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was most I can do is I only,</v>

2464
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:44.783
<v Speaker 1>this is because of the travel channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can do two weeks in two weeks and </v>

2465
01:43:47.361 --> 01:43:48.890
<v Speaker 1>at the end of two weeks I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me the fuck home.</v>

2466
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:52.550
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago I switched just Fridays </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Saturdays,</v>

2467
01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:53.453
<v Speaker 2>it was actually quite a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe going on a eight or nine </v>

2468
01:43:56.751 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of the best things I ever</v>

2469
01:43:58.611 --> 01:43:59.580
<v Speaker 2>did because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2470
01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.573
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think about like doing Thursday </v>

2471
01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:04.610
<v Speaker 2>and Sunday and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

2472
01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Then you just feel like it's just taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>up too much time.</v>

2473
01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:09.853
<v Speaker 2>I would rather do Friday and Saturday on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road and then come back home and if </v>

2474
01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:13.454
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a set Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a fucking set at the store or </v>

2475
01:44:15.041 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 2>the Improv or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just driving a town,</v>

2476
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get home.</v>

2477
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's a balance that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have.</v>

2478
01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Like we've all seen those guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>older and really burnt out,</v>

2479
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:29.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2480
01:44:29.071 --> 01:44:31.160
<v Speaker 2>they just don't have any energy left for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it anymore.</v>

2481
01:44:31.161 --> 01:44:34.190
<v Speaker 2>And they feel like it's a burden instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a pleasure.</v>

2482
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Like when I go on the road now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>

2483
01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've taken most of them this month </v>

2484
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:41.390
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

2485
01:44:41.391 --> 01:44:44.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sixth at the Mirage in Vegas.</v>

2486
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing all the rest of the shows I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood.</v>

2487
01:44:48.051 --> 01:44:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a shitload of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did two last night.</v>

2488
01:44:50.931 --> 01:44:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I did Largo and then I did the store the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night before I did the Improv,</v>

2489
01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:57.290
<v Speaker 2>then I did two sets at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm doing a lot of comedy,</v>

2490
01:44:57.650 --> 01:44:58.850
<v Speaker 2>but I'm home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2491
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:59.840
<v Speaker 2>and I'm doing this.</v>

2492
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Being home has been really enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to,</v>

2493
01:45:02.301 --> 01:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I go to Chicago in a week and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2494
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited because I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>

2495
01:45:06.321 --> 01:45:07.154
<v Speaker 1>So I'm excited for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to do a week sober and see </v>

2496
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:12.550
<v Speaker 1>like do some hot yoga and Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

2497
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm excited for Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then.</v>

2498
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 1>But then I go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2499
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.730
<v Speaker 1>like in November it starts up hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2500
01:45:19.731 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2501
01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't cancel because I've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to these days.</v>

2502
01:45:22.871 --> 01:45:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I canceled Austin and everyone lost her </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2503
01:45:25.190 --> 01:45:26.530
<v Speaker 1>How'd you cancel it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you cancel?</v>

2504
01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.393
<v Speaker 1>So we were doing this month and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>show up in my calendar and then it did </v>

2505
01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:30.570
<v Speaker 1>one day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2506
01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:31.483
<v Speaker 1>no I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it because of the sober </v>

2507
01:45:33.591 --> 01:45:34.424
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I canceled because I was coming off of </v>

2508
01:45:35.391 --> 01:45:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Australia DC and then I would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten six days off then gone right back</v>

2509
01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:39.800
<v Speaker 1>on the road.</v>

2510
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

2511
01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:44.390
<v Speaker 1>this is about getting healthy and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting my mind back about me.</v>

2512
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 1>And so by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got,</v>

2513
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:49.460
<v Speaker 1>if you need to refund your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just call the box office at Austin,</v>

2514
01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:50.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll refund your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ham.</v>

2515
01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.770

<v Speaker 1>it was serious.</v>

2516
01:45:51.771 --> 01:45:53.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a serious choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2517
01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

2518
01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.220

2533
01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.533

<v Speaker 1>I didn't like the theater tour offers </v>

2534
01:46:33.891 --> 01:46:36.440
<v Speaker 1>this year and it was mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be very candid.</v>

2535
01:46:36.441 --> 01:46:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money was just shit.</v>

2536
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2537
01:46:39.681 --> 01:46:41.270
<v Speaker 1>well this is the one year I can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2538
01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I can make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make x amount of dollars,</v>

2539
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a,</v>

2540
01:46:46.071 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>at a club by doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by getting 90 percent of the door and do</v>

2541
01:46:49.951 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 1>an</v>

2542
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:51.700
<v Speaker 3>sales sell $30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get a,</v>

2543
01:46:51.701 --> 01:46:53.180
<v Speaker 3>you can get some real money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Or I can do theaters and it's about </v>
<v Speaker 3>prestige.</v>

2545
01:46:55.531 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 3>For me it would be about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2546
01:46:56.971 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I do theaters as opposed to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never met Jack Shit to me.</v>

2547
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>But it does for some comics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's stupid.</v>

2548
01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally had an agent tell me,</v>

2549
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:06.833
<v Speaker 3>now that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing theater so you can't go </v>

2550
01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:09.760
<v Speaker 3>back to clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like years ago when I first started</v>

2551
01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 3>particularly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

2552
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:12.474
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do clubs like I do the </v>

2553
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 3>laughing skull in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

2554
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Ian Edwards there this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go see Ian Edwards,</v>

2555
01:47:17.551 --> 01:47:20.760
<v Speaker 3>one of the best comics life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only like 90 seats.</v>

2556
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 88 does it?</v>

2557
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.890
<v Speaker 3>I know that because I stopped doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't make my money.</v>

2558
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I did that two years ago or maybe year </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half ago.</v>

2559
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do little places.</v>

2560
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I do the comedy works in Denver still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2561
01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 3>I do those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you got to do those.</v>

2562
01:47:36.721 --> 01:47:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I think you got to do the little spots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2563
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.010
<v Speaker 3>House constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did wise guys in Utah.</v>

2564
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I know you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

2565
01:47:43.321 --> 01:47:44.154
<v Speaker 3>I remember at the time I was there when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they put those tickets on sale and I </v>

2566
01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:48.240
<v Speaker 3>think Keith came in and was sold out </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

2567
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2568
01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:53.670
<v Speaker 3>He's like your buddy Joe Rogan just sold</v>
<v Speaker 3>out already already walked away.</v>

2569
01:47:53.671 --> 01:47:54.600
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

2570
01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to have weight lifting,</v>

2571
01:47:58.741 --> 01:48:00.900
<v Speaker 3>but you also have to have yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have running,</v>

2572
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:02.003
<v Speaker 3>but you also should do something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think you got to have a balanced </v>

2573
01:48:04.650 --> 01:48:08.790
<v Speaker 3>approach to stand up and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things is like intimate rooms,</v>

2574
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:11.610
<v Speaker 3>like being right in front of people you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2575
01:48:11.611 --> 01:48:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and then also not sometimes being in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big ass place.</v>

2576
01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm doing the Belko theater in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Denver.</v>

2577
01:48:16.351 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 3>That's like 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2578
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of place that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2579
01:48:20.131 --> 01:48:22.380
<v Speaker 3>you have the big show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>

2580
01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:24.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not intimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2581
01:48:24.451 --> 01:48:25.284
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're act gets honed and all these </v>

2582
01:48:26.761 --> 01:48:29.310
<v Speaker 3>other places too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This razor sharp edge.</v>

2583
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.880
<v Speaker 3>And then you go to that place just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking send it home.</v>

2584
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.600
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roars of like 6,000</v>

2585
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:37.470
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2586
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to go into a big theater and </v>
<v Speaker 3>go like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how to do that bit.</v>

2622
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.700
<v Speaker 3>I literally don't know how to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

2623
01:49:57.730 --> 01:50:00.670
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to go over it when I'm done,</v>

2624
01:50:00.671 --> 01:50:01.504
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to put that shit aside and move </v>

2625

2629
01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:12.933

<v Speaker 3>like it's the way a lot of people found </v>

2630
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:19.894
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for a lot of people it's my </v>

2631
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:22.090
<v Speaker 3>nickname.</v>

2632

2668
01:51:43.511 --> 01:51:44.310

01:54:08.991 --> 01:54:09.824
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

01:54:29.061 --> 01:54:29.894
<v Speaker 4>they set this place up,</v>

2741
01:54:31.401 --> 01:54:32.234
<v Speaker 4>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put this thing together and it was </v>

2744
01:54:36.810 --> 01:54:40.370

01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:45.460
<v Speaker 4>Might've had something to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2747
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.340
<v Speaker 4>and then then it went under and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2748
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.420
<v Speaker 4>the comedy connection open and Faneuil </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hall.</v>

2749
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.130
<v Speaker 4>So they had a comedy connection down the</v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

2750
01:54:52.131 --> 01:54:53.810
<v Speaker 4>That was a great club at one point in </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2751
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:54.644
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a the comedy connection in on </v>

2752
01:54:57.501 --> 01:54:58.334
<v Speaker 4>Washington Street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was like 150 seats and then they </v>

2753
01:55:01.611 --> 01:55:03.290
<v Speaker 4>had nick's comedy stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is down the street,</v>

2754
01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:08.120
<v Speaker 4>which is maybe 300 seats and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had nick's comedy stop at one point,</v>

2755
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 4>had three rooms.</v>

2756
01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:09.973
<v Speaker 4>They had the upstairs room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a downstairs smaller room and </v>

2757
01:55:12.561 --> 01:55:13.394
<v Speaker 4>then they had this disco that's now a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay bar that's at the bottom and that </v>

2758
01:55:17.211 --> 01:55:18.044
<v Speaker 4>was something they took over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had three shows going </v>

2759
01:55:20.031 --> 01:55:20.864
<v Speaker 4>consecutively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they'd have like Steve Sweeney would </v>

2760
01:55:23.121 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 4>go on there and then he would go down to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the small room and then you'd go over to</v>

2761
01:55:26.091 --> 01:55:28.820
<v Speaker 4>the big room and he would do three shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

2762
01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:33.110
<v Speaker 4>So he would do six sets or a nine sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2763
01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:33.973
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2764
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I probably six probably two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but six sets of two shows,</v>

2765
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2766
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:41.090
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like an eight and a 10,</v>

2767
01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.890
<v Speaker 4>but an eight and a 10 in all the rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2768
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you do six sets a night and then some</v>

2769
01:55:47.161 --> 01:55:49.170
<v Speaker 4>of the guys would go over to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection,</v>

2770
01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:50.540
<v Speaker 4>do a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go over to Nixon,</v>

2771
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.140
<v Speaker 4>do a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then duck soup opened.</v>

2772
01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.453
<v Speaker 4>And so like duck soup was the greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was that they got greedy and that </v>

2773
01:55:56.071 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 4>went under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when that went under bill bloomin',</v>

2774
01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was the genius behind?</v>

2775
01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:01.050
<v Speaker 4>He still owns it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2776
01:56:01.051 --> 01:56:02.880
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a financial wizard.</v>

2777
01:56:02.881 --> 01:56:04.460
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you guys doing?</v>

2778
01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.960
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me buy you out right here.</v>

2779
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:08.333
<v Speaker 4>Let me take care of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so bill took over the comedy </v>

2780
01:56:10.561 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 4>connection at Faneuil Hall and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that became a big success.</v>

2781
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.810
<v Speaker 4>And then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2782
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:18.510
<v Speaker 4>he just sat and listened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could fill this fucking place up.</v>

2783
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:21.780
<v Speaker 4>This is like 400 seats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't I just buy the Wilbur?</v>

2784
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.790
<v Speaker 4>So he bought the wilbur and now that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 900 seats now.</v>

2785
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:27.660
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the common connection now.</v>

2786
01:56:27.661 --> 01:56:29.570
<v Speaker 4>And he just brings in big acts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2787
01:56:29.571 --> 01:56:34.200
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that Boston last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like local thing.</v>

2788
01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:38.310
<v Speaker 4>They lost like the local scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the older big time headliners,</v>

2789
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 4>they got older and older and people sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of forgot.</v>

2790
01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 4>And then the open mic night scene once </v>
<v Speaker 4>patrice left and once burr left,</v>

2791
01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:47.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2792
01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.110
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the guys coming up,</v>

2793
01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:51.360
<v Speaker 4>there's not as strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there is now laugh.</v>

2794
01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Boston has got a good scene.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last time I was there,</v>

2795
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:55.860
<v Speaker 4>they were pretty excited about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scene.</v>

2796
01:56:55.861 --> 01:56:58.710
<v Speaker 4>They're saying this a lot of up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming guys coming and Gals,</v>

2797
01:56:58.740 --> 01:56:59.573
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and binary nonbinary people and they've </v>

2798
01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:03.640
<v Speaker 4>developed like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2799
01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.890
<v Speaker 4>a good group of local people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really doing the right thing,</v>

2800
01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 4>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to really get good at comedy.</v>

2801
01:57:09.631 --> 01:57:11.940
<v Speaker 4>But Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was stitches,</v>

2802
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 4>there was a catch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rising star and Cambridge.</v>

2803
01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:18.210
<v Speaker 4>There was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a play it again.</v>

2804
01:57:18.211 --> 01:57:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Sam's had a show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking crazy.</v>

2805
01:57:20.371 --> 01:57:22.350
<v Speaker 4>Like for a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2806
01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Boston's not small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a huge city like Chicago or</v>

2807
01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:29.190
<v Speaker 4>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for this relatively small city,</v>

2808
01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 4>you had a fuck load of comedy and really</v>
<v Speaker 4>good comedy.</v>

2809
01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:38.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about the stores that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hit three stages in one night.</v>

2810
01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I do it all the time of Trifecta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2811
01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:41.214
<v Speaker 1>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that like three or four times </v>

2812
01:57:42.061 --> 01:57:43.330
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm due to their regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Jeremiah's new state new material</v>

2814
01:57:47.291 --> 01:57:47.890
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2815
01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:49.560
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I wrote that joke.</v>

2816
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The Helen Keller and frank joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2817
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy just said it on stage.</v>

2818
01:57:54.511 --> 01:57:55.344
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think they're the same person </v>

2819
01:57:56.490 --> 01:57:57.680
<v Speaker 1>and like I was staying in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your like,</v>

2820
01:57:57.690 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 1>that better be a fucking pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2821
01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just an idiot.</v>

2822
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I open up flying builders with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I was like,</v>

2823
01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that still aI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>love that show.</v>

2824
01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun way.</v>

2825
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>An exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did it Tuesday,</v>

2826
01:58:09.730 --> 01:58:10.351
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

2827
01:58:10.351 --> 01:58:11.184
<v Speaker 1>And I just started getting the vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it took me a long time to </v>

2828
01:58:14.131 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 1>understand the.</v>

2829
01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Or like the Olr for me was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an uphill battle.</v>

2830
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.820
<v Speaker 1>The main rooms always been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2831
01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.260
<v Speaker 1>so it was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a great performed,</v>

2832
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but like I think I was looking at tor as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2833
01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:32.400
<v Speaker 1>as like more of like less of a club and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of like a workshop and I was like,</v>

2834
01:58:32.401 --> 01:58:32.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2835
01:58:32.631 --> 01:58:32.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2836
01:58:32.911 --> 01:58:33.744
<v Speaker 1>you just got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where you have to be able to </v>

2837
01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>selling guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to,</v>

2838
01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:37.913
<v Speaker 1>to change subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving the jet to really read a crowd </v>

2839
01:58:40.411 --> 01:58:42.820
<v Speaker 1>and take their energy and move with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2840
01:58:42.821 --> 01:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds silly that I say this,</v>

2841
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but like in a rich vos kind of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's someone that could navigate the our</v>

2842
01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.420
<v Speaker 1>seamlessly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2843
01:58:49.421 --> 01:58:52.150
<v Speaker 1>because you can read an audience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the energy and push it.</v>

2844
01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>What's a very intimate room to like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of those guys from New York,</v>

2845
01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>they used to be an on top of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because New York clubs are very small,</v>

2846
01:58:58.991 --> 01:58:59.980
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2847
01:58:59.981 --> 01:59:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Because New York is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the space is small.</v>

2848
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:03.783
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a lot of small spaces like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever do the stand or a stand up New </v>

2849
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.141
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

2850
01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:08.974
<v Speaker 2>New York is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could barely move on stage for </v>

2851
01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:14.140
<v Speaker 2>caroline's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caroline's is like a fucking table.</v>

2852
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:15.343
<v Speaker 2>This table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this table is bigger than the stage at </v>

2853
01:59:17.351 --> 01:59:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Caroline's and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there,</v>

2854
01:59:19.901 --> 01:59:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you're on top of the people and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting right in front of you.</v>

2855
01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:22.890
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2856
01:59:22.890 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 2>it's odd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2857
01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get used to like,</v>

2858
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.940
<v Speaker 2>where are you from sir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of New York comics talk</v>

2859
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:32.950
<v Speaker 2>to the crowd and they also do like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly short chunks.</v>

2860
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.293
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bits are smaller and that's also </v>

2861
01:59:35.771 --> 01:59:37.510
<v Speaker 2>because they're sets are like seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes long.</v>

2862
01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:38.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember coming out here with Bobby </v>

2863
01:59:40.290 --> 01:59:41.123
<v Speaker 1>Kelly when probably it was with Bobby </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly the first night I did a spot out </v>

2864
01:59:42.601 --> 01:59:43.434
<v Speaker 1>here and I got on stage and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in my head going where the </v>

2865
01:59:45.931 --> 01:59:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2866
01:59:47.701 --> 01:59:48.870
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to talk about?</v>

2867
01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And I remember bobby getting up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

2868
01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.930
<v Speaker 1>both of us were sitting in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2869
01:59:52.170 --> 01:59:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this fucking clever shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking joke.</v>

2870
01:59:54.991 --> 01:59:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Clever Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be fucking funny.</v>

2871
01:59:56.851 --> 01:59:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And both of us were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2872
01:59:58.170 --> 01:59:59.340
<v Speaker 1>how can they be funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2873
01:59:59.341 --> 02:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the westerns were like used to.</v>

2874
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.333
<v Speaker 1>I used to make the analogy working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing standup in New York was like </v>

2875
02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>working out in the prison yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a,</v>

2876
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you had a broomstick and cinder blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just wanted to get big enough so</v>

2877
02:00:09.961 --> 02:00:10.794
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get raped in the shower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then working out in la was like almost </v>

2878
02:00:13.471 --> 02:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>like being at a gold's gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were sculpted,</v>

2879
02:00:15.361 --> 02:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you look good but you couldn't defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a real room.</v>

2880
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>And so like I looked at it that way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I was like,</v>

2881
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:22.103
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do the road you can do a little </v>

2882
02:00:22.831 --> 02:00:23.664
<v Speaker 1>bit of both and you can really have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the road is where I really </v>

2883
02:00:26.611 --> 02:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>learned how to do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for like doing an hour that were.</v>

2884
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>That was what I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2885
02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you need to be able to like,</v>

2886
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:37.320
<v Speaker 2>well you also have to do an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That translates in Kansas City.</v>

2887
02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:40.200
<v Speaker 2>You could do it in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make strangers laugh.</v>

2888
02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Use Case said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2889
02:00:41.881 --> 02:00:42.601
<v Speaker 2>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you do?</v>

2890
02:00:42.601 --> 02:00:43.434
<v Speaker 2>Ucb Goes,</v>

2891

<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2893
02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I want the art form is making strangers </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

2894
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2895
02:00:48.431 --> 02:00:49.870

<v Speaker 1>you gotta make people that.</v>

2896
02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why a lot of people do like to do</v>

2897
02:00:52.291 --> 02:00:53.124
<v Speaker 2>drop ins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want people coming to see </v>

2898
02:00:54.601 --> 02:00:57.180
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to do a set where people don't</v>

2899
02:00:57.181 --> 02:00:58.620
<v Speaker 2>have any idea that they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2900
02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.690
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a,</v>

2901
02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a thought process to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did Largo last night,</v>

2902
02:01:03.781 --> 02:01:05.010
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that like?</v>

2903
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.340
<v Speaker 2>They laugh at your setups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The setups.</v>

2904
02:01:08.341 --> 02:01:09.174
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking dying laughing at the </v>

2905
02:01:09.961 --> 02:01:10.551
<v Speaker 2>setups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2906
02:01:10.551 --> 02:01:12.990
<v Speaker 2>it's so odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say so polite.</v>

2907
02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The room's amazing.</v>

2908
02:01:16.441 --> 02:01:18.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a great setup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:01:18.361 --> 02:01:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>

2910
02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.433
<v Speaker 1>The nerdist meltdown one time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just told a story like just the </v>

2911
02:01:25.131 --> 02:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>story that I was working on and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered so hard and I was like,</v>

2912
02:01:28.191 --> 02:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>this is a really legit comedy club fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love comedy.</v>

2913
02:01:33.110 --> 02:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any little nuance to a joke,</v>

2914
02:01:35.361 --> 02:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they appreciate it.</v>

2915
02:01:36.501 --> 02:01:37.161
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2916
02:01:37.161 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>that was well played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that movie in high school to all</v>

2917
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.903
<v Speaker 2>rooms though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with those rooms is that if </v>

2918
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:48.461
<v Speaker 2>you just work those rooms and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to do a satiny or your Foxville,</v>

2919
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.453
<v Speaker 2>like if you try to go on after Joey Diaz</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Olr and all you do is all rooms </v>

2920
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>and by the way Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sick fuck,</v>

2921
02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>he will throw you on after Joey Diaz if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks you do a lot of rooms.</v>

2922
02:01:59.430 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You know like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to mention any names,</v>

2923
02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen people just incinerate up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2924
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:05.983
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're used to this like really </v>

2925
02:02:07.431 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 2>polite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up punchline sort of crowd.</v>

2926
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:12.530
<v Speaker 2>The comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a lot of this,</v>

2927
02:02:13.150 --> 02:02:15.770
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on is the best club in the world.</v>

2928
02:02:15.771 --> 02:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2929
02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see people that are drunk.</v>

2930
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>You get a surprising number of hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2931
02:02:21.970 --> 02:02:25.280
<v Speaker 2>the back hallway is always fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>talkative.</v>

2932
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible design.</v>

2933
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Like they'd been trying to figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>work around,</v>

2934
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck to do,</v>

2935
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:33.283
<v Speaker 2>but that back hallway always has people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're talking and then even if </v>

2936
02:02:36.621 --> 02:02:37.454
<v Speaker 2>they're not talking to people off to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the parking lot that leaks to </v>

2937
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:40.454
<v Speaker 2>the back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll see people that are in the </v>

2938
02:02:41.691 --> 02:02:42.524
<v Speaker 2>back of the store and the are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them turning around all the </v>

2939
02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:46.400
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

2940
02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:47.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so loud there.</v>

2941
02:02:47.710 --> 02:02:48.543
<v Speaker 1>I was on stage one time and clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost agent I go clearly someone very </v>

2944
02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:59.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was loud and immediately I </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2976

<v Speaker 1>that corner seat where the door opens </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to hit you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like how much money do you need?</v>

2985
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing all the travel channel</v>
<v Speaker 1>again at bars like,</v>

2986
02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:30.150

<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your show socks.</v>

2988
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I just do stand up for both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sat there and you were like,</v>

2989
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand up man.</v>

2990
02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you're doing on this TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2991
02:04:38.011 --> 02:04:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Just get back to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2992
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.033
<v Speaker 1>only at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get that conversation and only with </v>

2993
02:04:43.231 --> 02:04:45.180
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing that going,</v>

2994
02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>get what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2995
02:04:46.501 --> 02:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you monetize your podcast,</v>

2996
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you do the road and you could hang out </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2997
02:04:50.521 --> 02:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>And we all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this your show?</v>

2998
02:04:53.141 --> 02:04:53.974
<v Speaker 1>Are you really happy?</v>

2999
02:04:54.230 --> 02:04:55.063
<v Speaker 3>So important to have friends that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you that too because sometimes you </v>

3000
02:04:56.811 --> 02:04:58.710
<v Speaker 3>don't think you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>

3001
02:04:58.711 --> 02:04:59.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to stay under contract.</v>

3002
02:04:59.931 --> 02:05:00.764
<v Speaker 3>I have to have to keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I knew you were on the road for </v>

3003
02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.090
<v Speaker 3>fucking weeks at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3004
02:05:05.091 --> 02:05:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to do this.</v>

3005
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:09.320
<v Speaker 3>You're a funny guy and you're not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>working.</v>

3006
02:05:09.321 --> 02:05:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I stand up that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>

3007
02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.013
<v Speaker 3>You'd go on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't do standup for weeks at a </v>

3008
02:05:13.041 --> 02:05:13.610
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3009
02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:14.443
<v Speaker 1>I'd try to put in a date like jamming </v>
<v Speaker 1>the data in between touring but are </v>

3010
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:18.223
<v Speaker 1>doing travel channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth was I'd be away from my </v>

3011
02:05:19.341 --> 02:05:19.830
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

3012
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:21.270
<v Speaker 3>be a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

3013
02:05:21.271 --> 02:05:23.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not enough like a date doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

3014
02:05:23.941 --> 02:05:24.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3015
02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:25.734
<v Speaker 3>I was rusty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all you gotta do you know you </v>

3016
02:05:27.241 --> 02:05:28.440
<v Speaker 3>need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3017
02:05:28.441 --> 02:05:30.150

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3018
02:05:30.151 --> 02:05:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you take a month off running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be out of shape,</v>

3019
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa,</v>

3020
02:05:33.091 --> 02:05:35.160
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be fucking constantly going at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3021
02:05:35.190 --> 02:05:36.023
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3022
02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:39.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a beautiful grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3023
02:05:40.090 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm so glad you decided to bail on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit too.</v>

3024
02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:48.140
<v Speaker 3>So the best thing to watch is on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's my fitbit and I ran four miles.</v>

3025
02:05:49.130 --> 02:05:50.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I keep it.</v>

3026
02:05:50.690 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 3>I keep it just to track my try to get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,000</v>

3027
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:53.814
<v Speaker 3>steps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want the other watches as </v>

3028
02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:55.093
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a gift.</v>

3029
02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:57.810
<v Speaker 3>This has sentimental value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even the time isn't even.</v>

3030
02:05:57.811 --> 02:05:58.770
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3031
02:05:59.160 --> 02:05:59.993
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bracelet.</v>

3032
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:01.530
<v Speaker 3>The bracelet.</v>

3034
02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys wearing bracelets disturbed me.</v>

3035
02:06:06.230 --> 02:06:08.580
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a period where I was wearing a</v>

3036
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:11.220
<v Speaker 3>few bracelets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drives me nuts guys with three bracelets</v>

3037
02:06:11.221 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>on one wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3038
02:06:12.181 --> 02:06:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop.</v>

3039
02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:15.533
<v Speaker 3>Especially like Italian guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three gold bracelets and the pinky </v>

3040
02:06:19.141 --> 02:06:20.880
<v Speaker 3>ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not in the jewelry guy.</v>

3041
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3042
02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.510
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a jewelry guy.</v>

3043
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.373
<v Speaker 3>Thought it was your jewelry guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of joy do you ever have a </v>

3044
02:06:28.411 --> 02:06:29.940
<v Speaker 3>pinky ring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A?</v>

3045
02:06:29.941 --> 02:06:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever have a diamond ring?</v>

3046
02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:33.200
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3047
02:06:33.201 --> 02:06:34.034
<v Speaker 3>I bought a diamond ring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a plethora of bracelets before </v>

3048
02:06:36.871 --> 02:06:37.750
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3049
02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely wash my car.</v>

3050
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wash my corvette.</v>

3051
02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:46.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the only one I wash that in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>porsche.</v>

3052
02:06:46.391 --> 02:06:48.330
<v Speaker 3>I washed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the corvette is just.</v>

3053
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It's barely a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corvette is like an art piece.</v>

3054
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:52.283
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing about you is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how annexter ordinary you believe you </v>

3055
02:06:56.471 --> 02:06:57.820
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3056
02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that when we tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did the first hot yoga,</v>

3057
02:07:00.610 --> 02:07:01.443
<v Speaker 1>we did the hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got done and we were really fucking </v>

3058
02:07:03.161 --> 02:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>floored and the first thing we said was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already not doing it right.</v>

3059
02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he could do these in </v>
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>

3060
02:07:07.650 --> 02:07:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing Tom said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3061
02:07:11.050 --> 02:07:11.883
<v Speaker 1>at this point in Jos day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only like 10 in the morning and he </v>

3062
02:07:14.171 --> 02:07:17.110
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done kettlebells run or a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sets yet.</v>

3063
02:07:17.410 --> 02:07:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going home and eating candy bar.</v>

3064
02:07:18.941 --> 02:07:19.774
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like that's the one thing that's </v>

3065
02:07:23.081 --> 02:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>been pushing me through this month is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3066
02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go and run now.</v>

3067
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.513
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do more in a day </v>

3068
02:07:28.721 --> 02:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>than I normally do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3069
02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and I think that is only achievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only people a real true balance</v>

3070
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:37.143
<v Speaker 3>of like being sober and healthy and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just getting off the fucking rails all </v>

3071
02:07:39.851 --> 02:07:40.541
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3072
02:07:40.541 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Because if you do</v>

3073
02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:42.293
<v Speaker 2>go off the rails all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's just not capable of working </v>

3074
02:07:44.251 --> 02:07:45.084
<v Speaker 2>hard and if you're it just steps right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't just start running </v>

3075
02:07:49.801 --> 02:07:53.130
<v Speaker 2>six miles a day and doing kettle bells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then taking a 90 minute yoga class,</v>

3076
02:07:53.131 --> 02:07:55.310
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to have the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's not that.</v>

3077
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:59.670
<v Speaker 2>You're not conditioned to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can work out.</v>

3078
02:07:59.910 --> 02:08:00.743
<v Speaker 2>You could work up to those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could start off with just a </v>

3079
02:08:02.821 --> 02:08:05.070
<v Speaker 2>light half mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could start out with,</v>

3080
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:07.940
<v Speaker 2>do your best in a 90 minute yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3081
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:08.783
<v Speaker 2>you could start out doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things and then over time you </v>

3082
02:08:11.881 --> 02:08:14.910
<v Speaker 2>build up conditioning and strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

3083
02:08:14.911 --> 02:08:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 50 years old,</v>

3084
02:08:16.771 --> 02:08:17.604
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in better shape of my </v>

3085
02:08:18.241 --> 02:08:19.560
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never been more healthy.</v>

3086
02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I work out all the time.</v>

02:08:27.541 --> 02:08:28.374
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have way more time </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements and I do in terms of like </v>

<v Speaker 2>your body healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better you're going to feel.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3098
02:08:48.601 --> 02:08:49.434
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the first drink's going to be </v>

3099
02:08:50.681 --> 02:08:51.514
<v Speaker 3>hard for me to take because I feel I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like I'll be letting myself down </v>

3100
02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 3>because I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3101
02:08:55.541 --> 02:08:56.374
<v Speaker 3>I get teetotaller and I get guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 3>that first drink I probably do a shot </v>

3102
02:08:59.201 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 3>with red and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm gonna go to bed.</v>

3103
02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Does Dari do shots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a drink.</v>

3104
02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Have a glass of whiskey with ice or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3105
02:09:06.761 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I saw him do shots in Calgary here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3106
02:09:09.431 --> 02:09:11.530
<v Speaker 3>And then we lost him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't use to drink.</v>

3107
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I know when I first met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't drink at all.</v>

3108
02:09:14.351 --> 02:09:16.810
<v Speaker 3>He would smoke weed but he didn't drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he became a drink.</v>

3109
02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:18.970
<v Speaker 3>And when you moved to New York it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really?</v>

3110
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I never remember seeing him drink ever.</v>

3112
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember when he lived here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go to the store,</v>

3113
02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:25.113
<v Speaker 3>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a podcast or something and he get </v>

3114
02:09:26.441 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just,</v>

3115
02:09:27.190 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would eat candy.</v>

3116
02:09:29.230 --> 02:09:31.430
<v Speaker 3>That was his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

3117
02:09:31.431 --> 02:09:32.770
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine candy now.</v>

3120
02:09:36.131 --> 02:09:38.020

<v Speaker 3>Some people actually like candy,</v>

3121
02:09:38.021 --> 02:09:40.420
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of lifters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people lift.</v>

3122
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 3>They like to eat candy after they work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3128
02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:52.660

<v Speaker 2>running his fucking animal.</v>

3150
02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:59.120

3157
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:15.163
<v Speaker 2>it will give you a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody should tell them that they </v>

<v Speaker 1>one of the things he put on the side was</v>

3169
02:11:45.421 --> 02:11:47.190
<v Speaker 1>a no one cares work harder.</v>

3170

<v Speaker 2>One of his sayings.</v>

3173
02:11:51.641 --> 02:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3174
02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I posted something on instagram today </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's levels to this shit.</v>

3175
02:11:57.370 --> 02:11:58.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were talking about,</v>

3176
02:11:58.391 --> 02:12:00.040
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very self critical,</v>

3177
02:12:00.041 --> 02:12:00.874
<v Speaker 2>like super hyper self critical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the reasons why I'm hyper </v>

3178
02:12:03.221 --> 02:12:04.054
<v Speaker 2>self critical is I know people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just real savages who really are doing </v>

3179
02:12:09.131 --> 02:12:09.964
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary things and people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>self congratulatory for no reason drive </v>

3180
02:12:14.861 --> 02:12:17.470
<v Speaker 2>me fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you laughing?</v>

3181
02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Congrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3182
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like half joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3183
02:12:22.531 --> 02:12:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I.</v>

3184
02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.590
<v Speaker 1>But I have a very low threshold for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

3185
02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:29.640
<v Speaker 1>It's to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3186
02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:32.010
<v Speaker 1>and I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have like a,</v>

3187
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:33.383
<v Speaker 1>like I think that's why I'm doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>half marathon because I was like I need </v>

3188
02:12:34.861 --> 02:12:36.900
<v Speaker 1>to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start testing myself.</v>

3189
02:12:36.901 --> 02:12:37.734
<v Speaker 1>I want to start saying to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's break two hours and a half </v>

3190
02:12:39.721 --> 02:12:40.950
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can do that.</v>

3191
02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:43.200
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

3192
02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:44.453
<v Speaker 1>I think I do that with physical stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was an athlete growing up and </v>

3193
02:12:47.221 --> 02:12:48.054
<v Speaker 1>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

3194
02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I can always jump back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to stand up,</v>

3195
02:12:50.521 --> 02:12:52.920
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am beyond fucking critical.</v>

3196
02:12:53.010 --> 02:12:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I look at some of these people that put </v>
<v Speaker 1>out hours and I go like,</v>

3197
02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:57.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3198
02:12:58.410 --> 02:12:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to name names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

3199
02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:04.020
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>said like,</v>

3200
02:13:04.021 --> 02:13:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't say names,</v>

3201
02:13:05.671 --> 02:13:07.980
<v Speaker 1>but they closed their specialist street </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes and I was like,</v>

3202
02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make,</v>

3203
02:13:09.531 --> 02:13:10.920
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have friends.</v>

3204
02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:11.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3205
02:13:14.090 --> 02:13:16.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will stay my friend.</v>

3206
02:13:16.071 --> 02:13:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I would have told you don't do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3207
02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:19.640
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing man.</v>

3208
02:13:19.641 --> 02:13:22.610
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that get caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other stuff is one of the things we</v>

3209
02:13:22.611 --> 02:13:24.290
<v Speaker 2>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you doing the travel channel.</v>

3210
02:13:24.291 --> 02:13:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you're doing movies all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

3211
02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:26.970
<v Speaker 2>you do one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3212
02:13:26.970 --> 02:13:28.670
<v Speaker 2>three movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year movies.</v>

3213
02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:31.380
<v Speaker 2>You know how that grind is 16 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day on set.</v>

3214
02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to hit the clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have time to grind.</v>

3215
02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 2>You're not going over your material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going over your lines.</v>

3216
02:13:36.301 --> 02:13:37.134
<v Speaker 2>You're taking naps because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tired all the time because </v>

3217
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're not an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not someone who's like really fit</v>

3218
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 2>and healthy and eating really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

3219
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Your body is worn the fuck out by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time those three,</v>

3220
02:13:46.261 --> 02:13:47.094
<v Speaker 2>four months of filming or done and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do press junkets and you </v>

3221
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:53.190
<v Speaker 2>have to do that and then someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>

3222
02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Hbo comes along and offers you all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cash to do a special.</v>

3223
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3224
02:13:57.450 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to say no and by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3225
02:13:59.011 --> 02:14:01.050
<v Speaker 2>your agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your managers,</v>

3226
02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>unless they're fucking top of the food </v>
<v Speaker 2>chain,</v>

3227
02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:09.120
<v Speaker 2>they don't know shit about what it takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do standup because they don't do it.</v>

3228
02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a really good manager </v>
<v Speaker 2>who goes,</v>

3229
02:14:12.541 --> 02:14:13.374
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really need to manage the time that </v>

3230
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:16.623
<v Speaker 2>in the energy and the focus you put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your act because you only get one shot </v>

3231
02:14:19.531 --> 02:14:21.230
<v Speaker 2>at doing this act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3232
02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.073
<v Speaker 2>and I fucked that up before and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of us have before we've all done </v>

3233
02:14:25.501 --> 02:14:28.250
<v Speaker 2>sets where we weren't really prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't really.</v>

3234
02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it takes until you do it wrong,</v>

3235
02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:36.390
<v Speaker 2>and then you feel the sting of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocrity and then you realize like,</v>

3236
02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:37.253
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no substitute for running 200 </v>

3237
02:14:38.401 --> 02:14:40.080
<v Speaker 2>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to fucking run everyday.</v>

3238
02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:42.630
<v Speaker 2>There's no substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no substitute for stand up.</v>

3239
02:14:42.631 --> 02:14:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You have to fucking grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to grind?</v>

3240
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:46.880
<v Speaker 1>You've got to watch your sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to go through and say,</v>

3241
02:14:46.881 --> 02:14:49.190
<v Speaker 1>where's the lazy writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to punch up the good writing.</v>

3242
02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That last hour special I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the one that really helped break</v>

3243
02:14:52.671 --> 02:14:57.671
<v Speaker 1>me to sell tickets and whatnot was was </v>
<v Speaker 1>me looking at it from the travel channel</v>

3244
02:14:58.491 --> 02:15:01.140
<v Speaker 1>perspective of Lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get the work done,</v>

3245
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>get it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get the last.</v>

3246
02:15:02.871 --> 02:15:03.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then going and started hanging out </v>

3247
02:15:06.710 --> 02:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>with clubs and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3248
02:15:08.271 --> 02:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3249
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:11.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of laziness in this act </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>

3250
02:15:11.571 --> 02:15:12.404
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to really be honest with myself </v>

3251
02:15:14.481 --> 02:15:15.300
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3252
02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>this is hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is.</v>

3253
02:15:17.150 --> 02:15:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing the work in the special.</v>

3254
02:15:19.590 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that applies to everybody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does everything.</v>

3255
02:15:22.610 --> 02:15:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not just to our creative endeavor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of standup comedy,</v>

3256
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:28.520
<v Speaker 2>but if you are whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fucking engineer,</v>

3257
02:15:28.530 --> 02:15:30.420
<v Speaker 2>if you're a chef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

3258
02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:33.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you focus on and it gets good.</v>

3259
02:15:33.810 --> 02:15:35.910
<v Speaker 2>If you focus more on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll get great.</v>

3260
02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:36.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just you have to figure out what's </v>

3261
02:15:38.251 --> 02:15:40.170
<v Speaker 2>missing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the weak spots,</v>

3262
02:15:40.171 --> 02:15:42.390
<v Speaker 2>where's the holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could be done better?</v>

3263
02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Approach it from a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3264
02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:45.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I'll do and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

3265
02:15:45.810 --> 02:15:48.780
<v Speaker 2>This is a thing that I've been doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot over the last two years.</v>

3266
02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a bit that I know is killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doing well.</v>

3267
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's done.</v>

3268
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:58.770
<v Speaker 2>So now I look at the same subject with </v>
<v Speaker 2>open eyes,</v>

3269
02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like completely fresh eyes and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to rewrite it.</v>

3270
02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:05.490
<v Speaker 2>I try to rewrite the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to write the bit almost as if</v>

3271
02:16:05.491 --> 02:16:06.324
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how the other big </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals and I write a new version of it </v>

3272
02:16:09.090 --> 02:16:10.770
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes when I write a new version</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

3273
02:16:10.771 --> 02:16:11.604
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a whole new take that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>add to the first version and the only </v>

3274
02:16:14.701 --> 02:16:16.710
<v Speaker 2>way you do that as if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>complacent.</v>

3275
02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.573
<v Speaker 2>The only way you're willing to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as if you fucking hate yourself and you </v>

3276
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:21.990
<v Speaker 2>want to just grind it out all the time.</v>

3277
02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either or this hour I'm working on now.</v>

3278
02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3279
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3280
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've forgotten too </v>
<v Speaker 1>meticulous with it.</v>

3281
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I've gotten to the point where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3282
02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:36.770
<v Speaker 1>every job needs to have closure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing more.</v>

3283
02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:37.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm really doing more stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like doing more like premise </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I was doing,</v>

3301
02:17:12.761 --> 02:17:16.000

<v Speaker 1>to do what everyone else is doing,</v>

02:17:40.811 --> 02:17:44.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember I've said this a million</v>

3314
02:17:44.531 --> 02:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>times too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it a million times more.</v>

3315
02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I did this podcast and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your store.</v>

3316
02:17:49.041 --> 02:17:51.190
<v Speaker 1>That's your closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to fucking figure that out.</v>

3317
02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:52.413
<v Speaker 1>And I went to Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio that first time I was at that next </v>

3318
02:17:55.661 --> 02:17:57.370
<v Speaker 1>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid in the front rows,</v>

3319
02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3320
02:17:58.361 --> 02:17:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3321
02:17:59.411 --> 02:18:00.131
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3322
02:18:00.131 --> 02:18:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Rogan said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should tell it.</v>

3323
02:18:01.031 --> 02:18:01.864
<v Speaker 1>Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>

3324
02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:04.090
<v Speaker 1>we understand it won't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

3325
02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh these are the fans I get like,</v>

3326
02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:07.593
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I learned so much at a telling that </v>

3327
02:18:09.431 --> 02:18:12.550
<v Speaker 1>story about how to write stories and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do stories.</v>

3328
02:18:12.551 --> 02:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3329
02:18:13.831 --> 02:18:14.664
<v Speaker 1>when people come see my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to have a good time and they </v>

3330
02:18:16.031 --> 02:18:18.100
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear my view on fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminism.</v>

3331
02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:19.373
<v Speaker 1>They don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year view on feminism is really </v>

3332
02:18:20.501 --> 02:18:21.040
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3333
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Unless it's funny even you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3334
02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:24.593
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you feel like saying so many </v>

3335

<v Speaker 1>that was fucking amazing.</v>

3429
02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:46.670
<v Speaker 3>You're slammed my nipple in a bank </v>
<v Speaker 3>vault.</v>

3430
02:21:46.671 --> 02:21:51.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel shit useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't work.</v>

3431
02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn things.</v>

3432
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Delegate elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's like.</v>

3433
02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:02.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like Balsa simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very similar to an elbow.</v>

3434
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:02.940
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3435
02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Ball sack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't like.</v>

3436
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:05.610
<v Speaker 1>You could pinch my ball sack with </v>
<v Speaker 1>buyers.</v>

3437
02:22:05.611 --> 02:22:06.444
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't feel it.</v>

3438
02:22:07.290 --> 02:22:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The skin's not very sensitive,</v>

3439
02:22:08.821 --> 02:22:10.290
<v Speaker 3>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they go like this,</v>

3440
02:22:10.291 --> 02:22:12.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they tickle my go right up in me,</v>

3441
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:14.240
<v Speaker 3>they suck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3442
02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Really liked like a witchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roommaster.</v>

3443
02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:17.303
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone gets what they would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would suck their balls up into </v>

3444
02:22:20.191 --> 02:22:22.640
<v Speaker 3>their bodies so you can kick them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>knots and it doesn't even hurt.</v>

3445
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Really know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3446
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 3>did</v>

3447
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.843
<v Speaker 2>those fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are a bunch of guys that get </v>

3448
02:22:28.641 --> 02:22:30.920
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the balls and they somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another can endure it.</v>

3449
02:22:31.850 --> 02:22:32.571
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a.</v>

3450
02:22:32.571 --> 02:22:33.404
<v Speaker 1>We had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a bid on a TV show where there </v>

3451
02:22:34.431 --> 02:22:36.410
<v Speaker 1>was a strap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put diversity.</v>

3452
02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:39.950
<v Speaker 1>This now it looks like a seatbelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes around and conquer it.</v>

3453
02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:40.784
<v Speaker 1>Goes knows for some spike show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes around your feet and then it </v>

3454
02:22:43.671 --> 02:22:46.820
<v Speaker 1>rides your inseam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like a seatbelt,</v>

3455
02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:50.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an inch shorter than your inseam.</v>

3456
02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:53.360
<v Speaker 1>So theoretically when you kick it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your foot,</v>

3457
02:22:53.361 --> 02:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>the foot strap stops the foot before </v>
<v Speaker 1>history balls.</v>

3458
02:22:55.690 --> 02:22:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does that make sense?</v>

3459
02:22:57.140 --> 02:22:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if you had really,</v>

3460
02:22:59.061 --> 02:22:59.894
<v Speaker 1>really strong inseams and you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the balls because the ncm didn't </v>

3461
02:23:02.301 --> 02:23:03.470
<v Speaker 1>move because you're strapped on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

3462
02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:08.920
<v Speaker 1>So we get a punter and a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>punter and the whole gag is.</v>

3463
02:23:09.141 --> 02:23:10.550
<v Speaker 1>If I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get kicked in the balls.</v>

3464
02:23:10.551 --> 02:23:12.620
<v Speaker 1>But I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I got the strap on a fine,</v>

3465
02:23:12.621 --> 02:23:13.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3466
02:23:13.310 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

3467
02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked in the balls so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing like this.</v>

3468
02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:18.163
<v Speaker 1>But as he goes to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I squat down and I then loosen the </v>

3469
02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:24.680
<v Speaker 1>tension and then I got kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls by a pro uponor oh my.</v>

3470
02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I went down and you could lose a ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that man very easily.</v>

3471
02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I know a couple.</v>

3472
02:23:30.890 --> 02:23:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Well guys have lost a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple.</v>

3473
02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get kicked in the nuts and sparring</v>

3474
02:23:36.470 --> 02:23:38.780
<v Speaker 2>and they lose a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I lost it.</v>

3475
02:23:38.781 --> 02:23:39.614
<v Speaker 2>Not once in a tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Ball swole up like a fucking golf </v>

3476
02:23:41.931 --> 02:23:44.430
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more of a golf ball,</v>

3477
02:23:44.450 --> 02:23:45.283
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was big and bread and it turned </v>

3478
02:23:48.261 --> 02:23:49.460
<v Speaker 2>purple later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3479
02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:50.720
<v Speaker 2>it was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3480
02:23:50.721 --> 02:23:51.554
<v Speaker 2>I really thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had in the old days the cups </v>

3481
02:23:54.051 --> 02:23:54.884
<v Speaker 2>that you would have where like they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops that would sit in jockstraps and </v>

3482
02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:00.164
<v Speaker 2>when you would throw a kick like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times the ball would like poke out </v>

3483
02:24:03.561 --> 02:24:06.290
<v Speaker 2>from underneath the cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you get kicked in the nuts,</v>

3484
02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:10.130
<v Speaker 2>that cup was slamming into your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

3485
02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have really good compression shorts</v>

3486
02:24:12.531 --> 02:24:16.160
<v Speaker 2>and the balls get received is a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>called diamond mma cups.</v>

3487
02:24:16.161 --> 02:24:16.994
<v Speaker 2>They looked like they suck straight to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body and the outside soft and they </v>

3488
02:24:19.641 --> 02:24:22.370
<v Speaker 2>cover all your junk and it doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

3489
02:24:22.371 --> 02:24:24.920
<v Speaker 2>You could literally get kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls these things on and be okay.</v>

3490
02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Then they had these steel tie cups which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the most ideal,</v>

3491
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:31.220
<v Speaker 2>most uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the most ideal because they,</v>

3492
02:24:31.221 --> 02:24:33.860
<v Speaker 2>they tie up through your asshole like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>g string,</v>

3493
02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.330
<v Speaker 2>like fucking crank up back there time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

3494
02:24:36.350 --> 02:24:37.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's a steel cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3495
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Everything is just fucking shoved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3496
02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:40.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3497
02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:41.413
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pulled a cup out of the out of the </v>

3498
02:24:43.191 --> 02:24:46.580
<v Speaker 1>bag and it by itself and go throw it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your underwear.</v>

3499
02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:47.473
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that and you'd have to raw dog </v>

3500
02:24:48.771 --> 02:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>the cup in your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sand all of your Dick.</v>

3501
02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:57.580
<v Speaker 2>But designed balls are on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3502
02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:00.470
<v Speaker 2>And everybody knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows how bad they hurt.</v>

3503
02:25:00.471 --> 02:25:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not the thing that hurts </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than your eyeballs.</v>

3504
02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Things that hurts like your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything ball hurts.</v>

3505
02:25:06.530 --> 02:25:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your ipod,</v>

3506
02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.590
<v Speaker 1>was he ever been posting the Iheart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrible,</v>

3507
02:25:10.591 --> 02:25:12.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

3508
02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:14.250
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your balls man.</v>

3509
02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I said to someone one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were about to do this,</v>

3510
02:25:16.891 --> 02:25:19.380
<v Speaker 1>a snowball fight for professional stobo </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3511
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:23.820
<v Speaker 1>So they make them with snow pack them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're basically ice rocks and it's</v>

3512
02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:27.640
<v Speaker 1>called Yukigassen in Alaska and so we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to do it.</v>

3513
02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The night before I had said to someone,</v>

3514
02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you can hit me on the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

3515
02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather be hitting the dick then in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balls.</v>

3516
02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this girl,</v>

3517
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:37.750
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me you have no feeling in</v>

3518
02:25:37.751 --> 02:25:38.171
<v Speaker 1>your neck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3519
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:38.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel in my Dick.</v>

3520
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But like if you punch me in the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just deck,</v>

3521
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:45.460
<v Speaker 1>if you holding my dig my hand a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me I wouldn't hurt as bad as if you held</v>

3522
02:25:45.461 --> 02:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hand punched me.</v>

3523
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.943
<v Speaker 1>So the next day we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This year he is somewhat of a snowball </v>

3524
02:25:50.051 --> 02:25:52.900
<v Speaker 1>right when it starts and it hits me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the day.</v>

3525
02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it exploded in my pants.</v>

3526
02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.290
<v Speaker 4>I thought when I and my hands were cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I couldn't feel.</v>

3527
02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:01.270
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I touch this dick,</v>

3528
02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:06.300
<v Speaker 4>it will be in pieces like a trick cigar </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it hurt.</v>

3529
02:26:06.641 --> 02:26:09.250
<v Speaker 4>I've never felt a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she came up as I'm riding,</v>

3530
02:26:09.251 --> 02:26:10.084
<v Speaker 4>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I could punch you in the Dick </v>

3531
02:26:11.081 --> 02:26:11.980
<v Speaker 4>and it wouldn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3532
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 4>well what about animals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like animals all have their balls in the</v>

3533
02:26:16.301 --> 02:26:17.920
<v Speaker 4>outside world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never figured it out.</v>

3534
02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Like I think chimps probably figured it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3535
02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:20.704
<v Speaker 4>I bet they when they fight other chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they attack the balls because I know </v>

3536
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:25.000
<v Speaker 4>they do that with people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When chimps attack people,</v>

3537
02:26:25.001 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 4>they rip your Dick off and then bite </v>
<v Speaker 4>your fingers off,</v>

3538
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:28.990
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your fingers off and rip your Dick off.</v>

3539
02:26:28.991 --> 02:26:30.970
<v Speaker 4>They pull your eyes out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things they do.</v>

3540
02:26:30.971 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 4>They know what to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not trying to kill you.</v>

3541
02:26:33.281 --> 02:26:34.091
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maine.</v>

3542
02:26:34.091 --> 02:26:37.090
<v Speaker 4>You try to take away what you need and </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

3543
02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Bruce was little animals</v>

3544
02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast with and the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go and I just,</v>

3545
02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I love the way his brain works and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first things out of his mouth.</v>

3546
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a hairless chimp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I know,</v>

3547
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:50.543
<v Speaker 1>and he pulls it up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the woman was bathing with </v>

3548
02:26:53.041 --> 02:26:54.060
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bathing.</v>

3549
02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Like sleeping with him.</v>

3550
02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex with it.</v>

3551
02:26:56.181 --> 02:26:57.140
<v Speaker 4>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3552
02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:57.951
<v Speaker 4>hi too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

3553
02:26:57.951 --> 02:26:59.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would just give the chimp xanax.</v>

3554
02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:02.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She gave him a xanax and red wine.</v>

3555
02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:04.760
<v Speaker 4>The one that tore that lady's face off </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Connecticut.</v>

3556
02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:06.560
<v Speaker 4>She was giving him xanax and red wine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3557
02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Look at the muscles on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blocking.</v>

3558
02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is we look at that and go,</v>

3559
02:27:11.781 --> 02:27:12.890
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a bodybuilder.</v>

3560
02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:13.191
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3561
02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:14.810
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a chimpanzee.</v>

3562
02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:17.420
<v Speaker 4>Like those muscles are like courted </v>
<v Speaker 4>steel.</v>

3563
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:20.690
<v Speaker 4>They might be the same size as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilders muscles,</v>

3564
02:27:21.050 --> 02:27:25.100
<v Speaker 4>but the density of those muscles is off </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking charts.</v>

3565
02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:28.010
<v Speaker 4>Look at those arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude,</v>

3566
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.903
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've spent years of my life staring at </v>

3567
02:27:31.131 --> 02:27:34.490
<v Speaker 4>naked chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the chimp would mange.</v>

3568
02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:36.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is there some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease,</v>

3569
02:27:36.831 --> 02:27:39.170
<v Speaker 4>whereas hair falls off where you really </v>
<v Speaker 4>see their anatomy.</v>

3570
02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:40.693
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a stunning difference between them </v>

3571
02:27:41.991 --> 02:27:42.680
<v Speaker 4>and us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3572
02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:45.770
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of similarities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what's really,</v>

3573
02:27:45.771 --> 02:27:48.530
<v Speaker 4>really interesting is that that is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent animal.</v>

3574
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:51.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an intelligent animal that now uses</v>

3575
02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.393
<v Speaker 4>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much so that anthropologists are now </v>

3576
02:27:55.281 --> 02:27:57.680
<v Speaker 4>thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or biologists rather.</v>

3577
02:27:57.810 --> 02:27:58.643
<v Speaker 4>What would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would it be that studies chimps </v>

3578
02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:06.470
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely as anyway,</v>

3579
02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:09.390
<v Speaker 4>whoever the fuck studies chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have A.</v>

3580
02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:10.603
<v Speaker 4>I think they've universally concluded </v>
<v Speaker 4>that chimpanzees have entered the stone </v>

3581
02:28:14.331 --> 02:28:15.164
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they are using tools without being </v>

3582
02:28:18.201 --> 02:28:21.050
<v Speaker 4>taught so by other chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3583
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 4>they're using tools</v>

3584
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.813
<v Speaker 2>independently and they're using tools </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly and they using all kinds of </v>

3585
02:28:25.911 --> 02:28:26.744
<v Speaker 2>different tools and so they think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen is eventually </v>

3586
02:28:29.871 --> 02:28:30.704
<v Speaker 2>they're going to figure out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff and it could take hundreds </v>

3587
02:28:32.361 --> 02:28:34.730
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but chimpanzees,</v>

3588
02:28:34.731 --> 02:28:36.110
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees,</v>

3589
02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:37.790
<v Speaker 2>monkeys have entered the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3590
02:28:37.791 --> 02:28:38.624
<v Speaker 2>this is from the BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're using rocks and tools and </v>

3591
02:28:42.261 --> 02:28:45.020
<v Speaker 2>they're cutting things and breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>things open with tools.</v>

3592
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:48.820
<v Speaker 2>And C would say it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worksmanship,</v>

3593
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:50.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes them special.</v>

3594
02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.480
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a casual observer might struggle to even</v>

3595
02:28:53.481 --> 02:28:54.314
<v Speaker 2>identify them as ancient tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not their antiquity that's </v>

3596
02:28:57.081 --> 02:28:57.914
<v Speaker 2>exceptional either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're only about the same age as the </v>

3597
02:29:00.561 --> 02:29:01.394
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian periods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes these tools noteworthy is at </v>

3598
02:29:03.421 --> 02:29:06.230
<v Speaker 2>the t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands that held them weren't human.</v>

3599
02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:09.200
<v Speaker 2>These stone tools were wielded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>

3600
02:29:09.201 --> 02:29:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Competence and macaques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say that?</v>

3601
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Macaques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hightails monkeys,</v>

3602
02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:18.290
<v Speaker 2>but I thought that's a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3603
02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:19.513
<v Speaker 2>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the sites where they have been </v>

3604
02:29:21.261 --> 02:29:24.140
<v Speaker 2>unearthed or the basis of the brand new </v>
<v Speaker 2>field of science,</v>

3605
02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 2>primate archaeology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're saying now is,</v>

3606
02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:30.290
<v Speaker 2>if you think about human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3607
02:29:30.291 --> 02:29:33.500
<v Speaker 2>That one point in the history of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

3608
02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:34.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were far more primitive than we are </v>

3609
02:29:37.131 --> 02:29:37.821
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3610
02:29:37.821 --> 02:29:41.330
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and if you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people believing the illusion,</v>

3611
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:43.920
<v Speaker 2>if you go all the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3612
02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:45.590
<v Speaker 2>we were some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3613
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Australia pithy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3614
02:29:46.881 --> 02:29:47.714
<v Speaker 2>It's like some sort of a chimpanzee like</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanoid thing and that we got more and </v>

3615
02:29:52.701 --> 02:29:56.450
<v Speaker 2>more intelligent for whatever reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over the period of 2 million years,</v>

3616
02:29:56.451 --> 02:29:57.284
<v Speaker 2>the human brain size doubled and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that hunting may played a part of </v>

3617
02:30:01.161 --> 02:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>that cooking food might've played a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

3618
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:04.820
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>played a part in that,</v>

3619
02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:09.560
<v Speaker 2>but they think that if chimpanzees keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>going the way they're going,</v>

3620
02:30:09.561 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 2>now that who knows what the fuck a chimp</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like in a million years.</v>

3621
02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible that they could </v>

3622
02:30:17.031 --> 02:30:20.510
<v Speaker 2>grow to be a new type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>superintelligent primary.</v>

3623
02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3624
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:22.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3625
02:30:22.251 --> 02:30:23.330
<v Speaker 2>it was us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3626
02:30:23.331 --> 02:30:27.080
<v Speaker 2>If you believe evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I do,</v>

3627
02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:27.973
<v Speaker 2>but if you believe scientists the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>studied in the field believe that human </v>

3628
02:30:32.271 --> 02:30:33.104
<v Speaker 2>beings in this forum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've existed in this forum for </v>

3629
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:38.750
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the neighborhood of half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years plus,</v>

3630
02:30:38.810 --> 02:30:41.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the right number,</v>

3631
02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:43.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it varies back and forth,</v>

3632
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:49.330
<v Speaker 2>but who knows how many hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years before that we looked</v>

3633
02:30:50.211 --> 02:30:52.490
<v Speaker 2>exactly like these motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3634
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:57.260
<v Speaker 2>we've been around relatively recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at the history of the</v>

3635
02:30:57.261 --> 02:30:59.210
<v Speaker 2>human race versus the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3636
02:30:59.211 --> 02:31:01.070
<v Speaker 2>the world is like four and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion years old.</v>

3637
02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:03.350
<v Speaker 2>The humans haven't even been around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>

3638
02:31:03.351 --> 02:31:04.184
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's four and a half thousand </v>

3639
02:31:08.991 --> 02:31:11.360
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years old for the,</v>

3640
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:14.330
<v Speaker 2>for the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans less than a million.</v>

3641
02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So we're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're recent.</v>

3642
02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Recent people are recent things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have figured out how to radically change</v>

3643
02:31:21.691 --> 02:31:25.830
<v Speaker 2>our environment with tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now these things have figured out how</v>

3644
02:31:25.831 --> 02:31:26.664
<v Speaker 2>to start using tools on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what happened with us </v>

3645
02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:33.240
<v Speaker 2>millions of years ago or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3646
02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.050
<v Speaker 2>and this is what's happening with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is fairly recent.</v>

3647
02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:43.220
<v Speaker 2>We have now recovered buried stone tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>from activity areas of the stone tool of</v>

3648
02:31:43.321 --> 02:31:46.970
<v Speaker 2>all the stone tool using primates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3649
02:31:46.980 --> 02:31:47.670
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be weird,</v>

3650
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:48.503
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still can't understand how they can </v>

3651
02:31:50.051 --> 02:31:52.480
<v Speaker 1>teach them sign language and talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them crazy,</v>

3652
02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but had it like crazy.</v>

3653
02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3654
02:31:56.610 --> 02:31:57.530
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3655
02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:02.600
<v Speaker 2>humans have a very weird relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with primates to it's we,</v>

3656
02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:03.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3657
02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:06.190
<v Speaker 2>we expect them to be pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3658
02:32:06.210 --> 02:32:07.043
<v Speaker 2>that's what this crazy lady in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut where a friend got her face </v>

3659
02:32:09.001 --> 02:32:11.070
<v Speaker 2>ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they thought.</v>

3660
02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.950
<v Speaker 2>And the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that got his balls ripped off,</v>

3661
02:32:13.970 --> 02:32:16.410
<v Speaker 2>his face ripped off and the chimps </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards feed off.</v>

3662
02:32:16.411 --> 02:32:17.244
<v Speaker 2>You remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy had a pet chimp and that chimp </v>

3663
02:32:20.551 --> 02:32:21.384
<v Speaker 2>got too old and when they get old </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're incredibly strong and super </v>

3664
02:32:24.361 --> 02:32:25.194
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the consequences of biting </v>

3665
02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:28.104
<v Speaker 2>someone's finger off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just decide I'm going to bite your </v>

3666
02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:30.840
<v Speaker 2>finger off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3667
02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Give me that finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the chimpanzee is mean.</v>

3668
02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:38.070
<v Speaker 2>They're wired to survive in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3669
02:32:38.071 --> 02:32:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it is an insanely harsh environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little baby champion.</v>

3670
02:32:40.881 --> 02:32:41.714
<v Speaker 2>You look at that hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little baby and they're wired to </v>

3671
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:47.370
<v Speaker 2>survive in an incredibly harsh </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

3672
02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:53.060
<v Speaker 2>And that includes like fits violence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>retribution violence.</v>

3673
02:32:53.970 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking ruthless man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3674
02:32:56.311 --> 02:32:57.144
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gang up on other chimps and they </v>

3675
02:32:58.321 --> 02:32:59.154
<v Speaker 2>plot out war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they go after tribes of other </v>

3676
02:33:02.161 --> 02:33:06.690
<v Speaker 2>chimps and kill them and target them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they somehow or another figure out a way</v>

3677
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:09.360
<v Speaker 2>to communicate how to ambush other </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps.</v>

3678
02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:11.180
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of video on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3679
02:33:11.210 --> 02:33:13.200
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3680
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:15.570
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard shit to watch.</v>

3681
02:33:16.130 --> 02:33:16.963
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3682
02:33:17.810 --> 02:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I made a gorilla laugh one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at the,</v>

3683
02:33:21.430 --> 02:33:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called monkey kingdom in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>

3684
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And they have this depressed gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3685
02:33:25.161 --> 02:33:26.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3686
02:33:26.570 --> 02:33:27.403
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this circus had them before and they </v>

3687
02:33:30.201 --> 02:33:32.390
<v Speaker 1>took out his canines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

3688
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Because they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to use him.</v>

3689
02:33:34.490 --> 02:33:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So they removed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3690
02:33:35.511 --> 02:33:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

3691
02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they took the canines,</v>

3692
02:33:38.451 --> 02:33:42.940
<v Speaker 1>but apparently canines in the gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom are a sign of a.</v>

3693
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can become a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't have canines,</v>

3694
02:33:46.011 --> 02:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>then you were just shunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never get a partner.</v>

3695
02:33:48.490 --> 02:33:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And so they could never get this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla partner.</v>

3696
02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google dental implants.</v>

3697
02:33:54.130 --> 02:33:54.963
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3698
02:33:55.310 --> 02:33:56.940
<v Speaker 1>They can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hockey players handle.</v>

3699
02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:59.490
<v Speaker 1>No know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No they didn't.</v>

3700
02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like they could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get him some nice videos.</v>

3701
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:03.833
<v Speaker 1>Let's give them a fucking operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human teeth and throw a little gas bomb </v>

3702
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:09.620
<v Speaker 1>in his cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what the fuck's going on</v>

3703
02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:11.420
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like A.</v>

3704
02:34:11.421 --> 02:34:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was with the dogs.</v>

3705
02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:14.750
<v Speaker 1>He's really depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3706
02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called monkey kingdom is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the name of the place in Miami?</v>

3707
02:34:18.490 --> 02:34:19.420
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really depressed.</v>

3708
02:34:19.421 --> 02:34:20.254
<v Speaker 1>He's just a depressed a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Bet I can make them laugh and they're </v>

3709
02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:24.604
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely aren't going to make a </v>

3710
02:34:25.091 --> 02:34:27.670
<v Speaker 1>primate laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I swear to you,</v>

3711
02:34:27.671 --> 02:34:28.504
<v Speaker 1>I swear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this did not get included on my </v>

3712
02:34:29.471 --> 02:34:31.000
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>

3713
02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I started doing an impression of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>

3714
02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I just started going and then slamming </v>
<v Speaker 1>my chest and then I went number one like</v>

3715
02:34:37.811 --> 02:34:39.160
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he went,</v>

3716
02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

3717
02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I literally lost my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3718
02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:44.171
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

3719
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you made them laugh.</v>

3720
02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And I was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then travel channels I go to.</v>

3721
02:34:47.851 --> 02:34:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Let's see why that's pertinent to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

3722
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:50.463
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just made a fucking like real </v>

3723
02:34:53.470 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 1>depressed one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3724
02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.633
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3725
02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3726
02:34:57.760 --> 02:34:59.080
<v Speaker 1>how frustrating was at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3727
02:34:59.081 --> 02:35:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3728
02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I had a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

3729
02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I have a clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the frustrating part is I,</v>

3730
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:06.833
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the last season of birth to </v>

3731
02:35:07.701 --> 02:35:10.360
<v Speaker 1>conquer and I did the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3732
02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:11.493
<v Speaker 1>everything that we shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was my thumbprint because we were in </v>

3733
02:35:13.481 --> 02:35:16.660
<v Speaker 1>between presidents and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

3734
02:35:16.661 --> 02:35:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm very proud of that product and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed it to them and they're like,</v>

3735
02:35:19.391 --> 02:35:21.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not all brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they buried it,</v>

3736
02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>

3737
02:35:24.101 --> 02:35:26.470
<v Speaker 1>it was too blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was too rough.</v>

3738
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:28.810
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no intro reads,</v>

3739
02:35:28.811 --> 02:35:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name's Bert Kreischer and I'm outside</v>

3740
02:35:31.901 --> 02:35:32.734
<v Speaker 1>Cedar Point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the home of thrill rides in the middle </v>

3741
02:35:35.711 --> 02:35:36.880
<v Speaker 1>of Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is.</v>

3742
02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you do instead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be like A.</v>

3743
02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I would say stuff like I'm neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey is like a fat ass,</v>

3744
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:46.930
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not everyone likes it,</v>

3745
02:35:46.931 --> 02:35:48.190
<v Speaker 1>but if you're into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>

3746
02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:49.053
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were really fun reads and it </v>

3747
02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.190
<v Speaker 1>was so irreverent that if you saw them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

3748
02:35:54.191 --> 02:35:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you're not turning off the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3749
02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I registered it.</v>

3750
02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

3751
02:35:59.670 --> 02:36:01.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to them at the very beginning,</v>

3752
02:36:01.181 --> 02:36:02.014
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey listen,</v>

3753
02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:04.300
<v Speaker 1>can you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some clips we have in there.</v>

3754
02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:05.213
<v Speaker 1>It'll definitely go viral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you just air them to promote the </v>

3755
02:36:06.911 --> 02:36:07.541
<v Speaker 1>series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

3756
02:36:07.541 --> 02:36:08.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got this,</v>

3757
02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:11.140
<v Speaker 1>we know what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they didn't do it.</v>

3758
02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:14.260
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was this thing,</v>

3759
02:36:14.261 --> 02:36:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Tara dactyl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a ride in Colorado.</v>

3760
02:36:16.330 --> 02:36:18.520
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to their web,</v>

3761
02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:19.413
<v Speaker 1>if you go to travel channels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook page and see how many views </v>

3762
02:36:21.671 --> 02:36:23.200
<v Speaker 1>it's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll blow you away.</v>

3763
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.393
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never heard it when the show about </v>

3764
02:36:25.871 --> 02:36:28.360
<v Speaker 1>to air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aired it later on accident and it's</v>

3765
02:36:28.361 --> 02:36:29.194
<v Speaker 1>the most viewed thing networks ever had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in its history of being alive when </v>

3766
02:36:32.141 --> 02:36:32.974
<v Speaker 1>the editor by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by when they one girl edited by </v>

3767
02:36:34.571 --> 02:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know a.</v>

3768
02:36:35.770 --> 02:36:39.400
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to part ways with burt put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up and it's got swing.</v>

3769

3798
02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:07.970
<v Speaker 1>They took me into a spook house and it </v>

3799
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Please don't say it involves black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3802
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:17.443
<v Speaker 1>It's in A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I W I tried to post it </v>

3803
02:38:19.701 --> 02:38:24.530
<v Speaker 1>online because he used to let me post </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the content and then once we parted,</v>

3804
02:38:24.770 --> 02:38:26.900
<v Speaker 1>once they realized they were ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>part ways with me.</v>

3805
02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.980
<v Speaker 1>So it was their idea or your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked me what I wanted to do,</v>

3806
02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:32.090
<v Speaker 1>the president at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me out to lunch,</v>

3807
02:38:32.091 --> 02:38:33.050
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you want to do?</v>

3808
02:38:33.051 --> 02:38:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And I'd said to my therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3809
02:38:34.621 --> 02:38:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I think I don't want to ride roller </v>
<v Speaker 1>coasters.</v>

3810
02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm done riding roller coasters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do something that is my idea,</v>

3811
02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:42.680
<v Speaker 1>like I'll do something if you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3812
02:38:42.681 --> 02:38:43.514
<v Speaker 1>we could do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to just be a host for </v>

3813
02:38:45.321 --> 02:38:47.470
<v Speaker 1>hire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a focusing on standup,</v>

3814
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:48.343
<v Speaker 1>a focus on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do stuff that means something </v>

3815
02:38:49.971 --> 02:38:51.090
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last year,</v>

3816
02:38:51.350 --> 02:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>this is a last step for a full year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year ago on roughly probably today.</v>

3817
02:38:57.980 --> 02:38:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3818
02:38:59.301 --> 02:39:00.134
<v Speaker 1>like it was October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was before we had done the weight </v>

3819
02:39:01.581 --> 02:39:03.620
<v Speaker 1>loss challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the fattest I'd ever been.</v>

3820
02:39:04.010 --> 02:39:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd wrapper to conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about to start airing.</v>

3821
02:39:06.111 --> 02:39:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was October.</v>

3822
02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:12.050
<v Speaker 1>My special hadn't narrowed my specials </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in November and she said,</v>

3823
02:39:12.051 --> 02:39:12.771
<v Speaker 1>what are you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3824
02:39:12.771 --> 02:39:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ride roller coasters </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

3825
02:39:14.001 --> 02:39:14.870
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3826
02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And so then the fired Bert?</v>

3827
02:39:17.930 --> 02:39:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much.</v>

3828
02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my therapist is like,</v>

3829
02:39:20.421 --> 02:39:23.750
<v Speaker 1>don't go in and just ask for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say what you want and don't,</v>

3830
02:39:23.930 --> 02:39:26.270
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything other than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you say you wanted to do?</v>

3831
02:39:26.271 --> 02:39:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the idea that you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a show that I'm,</v>

3832
02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be doing.</v>

3833
02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:34.063
<v Speaker 1>You got to do another show I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a show with my buddy </v>

3834
02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:37.453
<v Speaker 1>tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was telling you about this </v>

3835
02:39:37.881 --> 02:39:39.230
<v Speaker 1>running Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3836
02:39:39.231 --> 02:39:40.064
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell it because it's a premise </v>

3837
02:39:40.581 --> 02:39:41.414
<v Speaker 1>is pretty high concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk afterwards but we're doing </v>

3838
02:39:43.401 --> 02:39:46.310
<v Speaker 1>that and then I'm doing scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I wanted to do.</v>

3839
02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in.</v>

3840
02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:48.213
<v Speaker 1>But I had already shot this product and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this one thing at a spook </v>

3841
02:39:50.181 --> 02:39:53.390
<v Speaker 1>house where it's like spooky house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a haunted house.</v>

3842
02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:54.860
<v Speaker 1>It's in Colorado.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that's not from opera to conquer.</v>

3845
02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:01.490
<v Speaker 1>That's from birth to conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old do I look at it?</v>

3846
02:40:01.730 --> 02:40:06.730

<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

3847
02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:08.564

<v Speaker 1>it is the funniest thing you've ever </v>

3848
02:40:10.371 --> 02:40:11.204
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it to them and they just clipped </v>

3849
02:40:12.291 --> 02:40:13.620
<v Speaker 1>it up and tried to make a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

3850
02:40:13.621 --> 02:40:14.454

<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I felt it</v>

3884
02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.630
<v Speaker 2>guilty that you guys went through all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit and I didn't do anything.</v>

3885
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.823
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to pay for like that's where </v>

3886
02:41:36.411 --> 02:41:37.244
<v Speaker 2>things get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my intention to pay for your trip </v>

3887
02:41:39.831 --> 02:41:42.560
<v Speaker 2>to the basketball game was a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention,</v>

3888
02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:43.813
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it put our in a weird place because I </v>

3889
02:41:45.951 --> 02:41:47.570
<v Speaker 2>kind of stepped in for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when,</v>

3890
02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:50.140
<v Speaker 2>oh Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our or as a wheelchair.</v>

3891
02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:51.313
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys would have sorted it out </v>

3892
02:41:53.001 --> 02:41:54.530
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't,</v>

3893
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:55.670
<v Speaker 2>didn't mean to do that.</v>

3894
02:41:55.710 --> 02:41:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You know when you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3895
02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry our.</v>

3896
02:41:58.751 --> 02:41:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3897
02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:01.860
<v Speaker 1>we've been friends a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

3898
02:42:01.861 --> 02:42:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I had it on my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you said it,</v>

3899
02:42:03.930 --> 02:42:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it was very like you didn't sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were.</v>

3900
02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like you're throwing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the bus at all.</v>

3901
02:42:08.791 --> 02:42:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he felt like a little bit.</v>

3902
02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:11.813
<v Speaker 1>But I also think there's blood in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and when there's blood in the </v>

3903
02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:14.514
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking online paranas they just </v>

3904
02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:16.380
<v Speaker 1>find a week.</v>

3905
02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spot.</v>

3906
02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:22.070
<v Speaker 1>And if you show that weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3907
02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:23.553
<v Speaker 1>milk for a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you were telling them about </v>

3908
02:42:24.891 --> 02:42:26.120
<v Speaker 1>the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

3909
02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:28.820
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking respond to those comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3910
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:30.290
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

3911
02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:33.170
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He look love him to death,</v>

3912
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but he posted something Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really shitty.</v>

3913
02:42:35.061 --> 02:42:38.120
<v Speaker 1>One time he knows it and anyone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows it knows it and if they don't know</v>

3914
02:42:38.121 --> 02:42:38.990
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll never know it.</v>

3915
02:42:38.991 --> 02:42:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I watched the comments roll in after</v>

3916
02:42:42.291 --> 02:42:43.124
<v Speaker 1>that and he didn't realize what he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted and I washed it and it was </v>

3917
02:42:45.891 --> 02:42:48.510
<v Speaker 1>realized he didn't realize it's a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and I'm going to get into,</v>

3918
02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:49.363
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I love already and I don't want to </v>

3919
02:42:49.951 --> 02:42:50.784
<v Speaker 1>end up to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like he didn't realize what he had </v>

3920
02:42:52.581 --> 02:42:53.414
<v Speaker 1>posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was posting something fun </v>

3921
02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>and he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was super serious.</v>

3922
02:42:57.440 --> 02:42:58.273
<v Speaker 1>And then dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched these people rolling with </v>

3928
02:43:13.301 --> 02:43:14.530
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

3929
02:43:14.590 --> 02:43:16.690
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you said you weren't going to smoke</v>

3930

<v Speaker 1>weed and we put the prey for Joe thing </v>

<v Speaker 1>don't ever forget you are nothing </v>

3932

<v Speaker 1>That is our medicine.</v>

3933
02:43:24.970 --> 02:43:27.910
<v Speaker 1>We need this medicine and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to deprive us of our medicine.</v>

3934
02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck do you think you're like,</v>

3935
02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:33.993
<v Speaker 2>I was rob us of our medicine people just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of broken people out </v>

3936
02:43:38.241 --> 02:43:38.870
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3937
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:40.880
<v Speaker 2>and whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

3938
02:43:40.881 --> 02:43:43.280
<v Speaker 2>That guy looked mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take my medicine for 12 days.</v>

3939
02:43:43.281 --> 02:43:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just relax.</v>

3940
02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people.</v>

3941
02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3942
02:43:48.470 --> 02:43:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a joke about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I did have a medical marijuana card</v>

3943
02:43:53.121 --> 02:43:56.480
<v Speaker 2>before it was illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was illegal only medically,</v>

3944
02:43:56.810 --> 02:43:59.430
<v Speaker 2>but if you didn't get a medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana card,</v>

3945
02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.250
<v Speaker 2>if you went to a doctor and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3946
02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:02.293
<v Speaker 2>you should go to a fucking hospital </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's probably something really </v>

3947
02:44:04.101 --> 02:44:06.470
<v Speaker 2>wrong with you because they were giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>them away like candy,</v>

3948
02:44:06.471 --> 02:44:08.690
<v Speaker 2>like anybody can get a medical marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>card,</v>

3949
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:09.883
<v Speaker 2>and someone was said to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you are throwing it in the face of </v>

3950
02:44:12.291 --> 02:44:16.640
<v Speaker 2>the people that actually need marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like glaucoma or ptsd or whatever.</v>

3951
02:44:16.641 --> 02:44:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Like what you're doing is skirting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

3952
02:44:18.711 --> 02:44:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3953
02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:21.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3954
02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:23.740
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

3955
02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:24.573
<v Speaker 2>I'm still getting weed legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hurting anybody by getting weed </v>

3956
02:44:26.681 --> 02:44:27.514
<v Speaker 2>legally stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like promoting the fact that weeds </v>

3957
02:44:29.501 --> 02:44:30.334
<v Speaker 2>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also there's the thing with </v>

3958
02:44:32.531 --> 02:44:37.531
<v Speaker 2>like it's fun for just calming you down </v>
<v Speaker 2>and giving you a perspective in life.</v>

3959
02:44:38.170 --> 02:44:39.003
<v Speaker 2>I think weed has made me and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a lot of other factors </v>

3960
02:44:41.651 --> 02:44:43.660
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say it's all weed.</v>

3961
02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:45.203
<v Speaker 2>The weed is made me a nicer person </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's made me more sensitive and </v>

3962
02:44:47.861 --> 02:44:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I think that if there's one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could all use more in this,</v>

3963
02:44:51.101 --> 02:44:51.934
<v Speaker 2>like everybody gets carried away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's a work in progress and </v>

3964
02:44:54.641 --> 02:44:57.190
<v Speaker 2>people all say things that they probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have or just,</v>

3965
02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:01.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're acting impulsively or you know,</v>

3966
02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:02.613
<v Speaker 2>just you'd go with the thought that's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head and you say what's on your </v>

3967
02:45:05.231 --> 02:45:06.700
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't come out right.</v>

3968
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all done that.</v>

3969
02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:08.913
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But marijuana for me highlights all </v>

3970
02:45:10.991 --> 02:45:11.824
<v Speaker 2>those things and know almost ruthlessly </v>
<v Speaker 2>introspective way that makes me a nicer </v>

3971
02:45:15.041 --> 02:45:17.080
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me think about things,</v>

3972
02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:18.820
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3973
02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:20.860
<v Speaker 2>when I get in the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I smoke weed,</v>

3974
02:45:20.861 --> 02:45:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I just think about every thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a God damn.</v>

3975
02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should do that time.</v>

3976
02:45:27.810 --> 02:45:29.110
<v Speaker 1>New Studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should do that.</v>

3977
02:45:29.111 --> 02:45:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Tank new studio has a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do the tag before I quit before</v>

3978
02:45:33.191 --> 02:45:34.630
<v Speaker 1>October is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3979
02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:35.553

<v Speaker 1>I want to try it sober and then went in </v>

3980
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:39.700
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try it.</v>

3981
02:45:39.701 --> 02:45:40.534
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time.</v>

3982
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:41.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be installed in the third week of </v>

3983
02:45:43.011 --> 02:45:44.330
<v Speaker 2>October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3984
02:45:44.331 --> 02:45:44.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3985
02:45:44.871 --> 02:45:47.750
<v Speaker 2>The tanks coming soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as this one from your home.</v>

3986
02:45:47.930 --> 02:45:48.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3987
02:45:48.211 --> 02:45:48.891
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new one.</v>

3988
02:45:48.891 --> 02:45:50.630
<v Speaker 2>They took the one out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crashed.</v>

3989
02:45:50.631 --> 02:45:52.550
<v Speaker 2>By the way folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in California,</v>

3990
02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:53.433
<v Speaker 2>you the float lab is the greatest float </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the world and this guy is like </v>

3991
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.923
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people credit me for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a isolation tanks more </v>

3992
02:46:04.431 --> 02:46:06.680
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy that that's the case,</v>

3993
02:46:06.681 --> 02:46:07.514
<v Speaker 2>but my tank increased dramatically when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I hooked up with crash because I had a </v>

3994
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:17.990
<v Speaker 2>friend who was working on my tank and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fixing it and I had an older tank.</v>

3995
02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:19.093
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was good and I had great </v>

3996
02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:22.304
<v Speaker 2>experiences in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he told me about this guy in Venice </v>

3997
02:46:26.050 --> 02:46:28.580
<v Speaker 2>that ran this place called the float lab</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

3998
02:46:28.581 --> 02:46:29.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>

3999
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:32.000
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his stuff is just like super engineered.</v>

4000
02:46:32.001 --> 02:46:32.834
<v Speaker 2>It's like the best stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have any of the issues </v>

4001
02:46:34.881 --> 02:46:39.000
<v Speaker 2>with like the bladders at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hold the hold,</v>

4002
02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the water in breaking because he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>use waterbed bladders instead.</v>

4003
02:46:42.951 --> 02:46:45.500
<v Speaker 2>He uses those things to use for ponds </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Koi ponds,</v>

4004
02:46:45.501 --> 02:46:48.290
<v Speaker 2>like a very thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thick plastic.</v>

4005
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has air pumped in it so you get fresh</v>

4006
02:46:51.261 --> 02:46:52.094
<v Speaker 2>oxygen inside the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just like that he uses to waterbed </v>

4007
02:46:56.481 --> 02:46:59.000
<v Speaker 2>heaters and they work together </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

4008
02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:00.073
<v Speaker 2>His like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a really excellent digital </v>

4009
02:47:01.671 --> 02:47:02.504
<v Speaker 2>calibration system for the temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he takes it to the next level with </v>

4010
02:47:05.991 --> 02:47:08.540
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got an ozone filtration system that</v>

4011
02:47:08.541 --> 02:47:10.580
<v Speaker 2>kills all the bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kills everything.</v>

4012
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:11.623
<v Speaker 2>He uses two gigantic Jacuzzi filters </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything gets run through these </v>

4013
02:47:15.330 --> 02:47:18.500
<v Speaker 2>like tiny micron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the number is.</v>

4014
02:47:18.501 --> 02:47:19.334
<v Speaker 2>Filters where like they filter </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything out of that water and for me </v>

4015
02:47:22.341 --> 02:47:23.174
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's only me in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for public one it's critically </v>

4016
02:47:26.301 --> 02:47:28.490
<v Speaker 2>important that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4017
02:47:28.491 --> 02:47:29.324
<v Speaker 2>that you're not gonna catch some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin disease or something when you get </v>

4018
02:47:30.801 --> 02:47:31.670
<v Speaker 2>inside these tanks.</v>

4019
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:33.650
<v Speaker 2>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4020
02:47:33.651 --> 02:47:35.380
<v Speaker 2>I got in touch with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4021
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:36.283
<v Speaker 2>got a tank from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He installed them in my basement and </v>

4022
02:47:38.331 --> 02:47:38.891
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4023
02:47:38.891 --> 02:47:39.724
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't shut the fuck up about things I </v>

4024
02:47:41.091 --> 02:47:44.780
<v Speaker 2>love and that's part of my problem was </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm repetitive as fuck,</v>

4025
02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's what makes me good at things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get obsessive and that mindset,</v>

4026
02:47:49.321 --> 02:47:50.154
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like constantly droning on </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the same things constantly and </v>

4027
02:47:52.521 --> 02:47:54.320
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that becomes a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

4028
02:47:54.321 --> 02:47:56.890
<v Speaker 2>but crash that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

4029
02:47:56.920 --> 02:47:59.660
<v Speaker 2>he's the motherfucker behind tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for him,</v>

4030
02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:03.200
<v Speaker 2>the tanks that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even not the non crash tanks,</v>

4031
02:48:03.320 --> 02:48:04.153
<v Speaker 2>non float lab tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other tanks in the world they </v>

4032
02:48:07.101 --> 02:48:08.750
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the gold standard.</v>

4033
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:12.650
<v Speaker 2>His tanks are the gold standard in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other tanks since then have.</v>

4034
02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:13.993
<v Speaker 2>They've elevated in quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantially because of his </v>

4035
02:48:16.641 --> 02:48:19.250
<v Speaker 2>contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first started using the tank,</v>

4036
02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:22.100
<v Speaker 2>which was like early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 2000,</v>

4037
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I think I got one in 2003 and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>our first time,</v>

4038
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.943
<v Speaker 2>first time I got in one was like 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>2001 and I had one in my basement in </v>

4039
02:48:30.921 --> 02:48:31.754
<v Speaker 2>2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that time the fucking whole </v>

4040
02:48:33.891 --> 02:48:36.710
<v Speaker 2>business has gone like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're everywhere.</v>

4041
02:48:36.711 --> 02:48:37.544
<v Speaker 2>Giant tanks.</v>

4042
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:38.543

4045
02:48:42.961 --> 02:48:44.320
<v Speaker 1>a tank place.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so we're getting a new one put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the thing about crash.</v>

4058

<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly like innovating.</v>

4059
02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:12.510
<v Speaker 2>He's like constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even if it tanks perfect,</v>

4060
02:49:12.511 --> 02:49:12.811
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4062
02:49:12.901 --> 02:49:14.340
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the old one,</v>

4063
02:49:14.430 --> 02:49:16.230
<v Speaker 2>the old version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to get rid of that.</v>

4064
02:49:16.231 --> 02:49:17.850
<v Speaker 2>We got to take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got an upgrade,</v>

4065
02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:19.150
<v Speaker 2>upgrade everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's.</v>

4066
02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:21.540
<v Speaker 2>He's just nuts with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4067
02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a mastermind.</v>

4068
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:26.850
<v Speaker 2>He's like a real mad scientist genius </v>
<v Speaker 2>character when it comes to tanks.</v>

4069
02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:27.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

4070
02:49:27.791 --> 02:49:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could fucking.</v>

4071
02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to get a tank.</v>

4072
02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:33.810
<v Speaker 1>You love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get into tm.</v>

4073
02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:35.860
<v Speaker 1>TM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendental meditation,</v>

4074
02:49:36.610 --> 02:49:38.860
<v Speaker 1>transcendental meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed the fucking class.</v>

4075
02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:39.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about tanks is you could do </v>

4076
02:49:41.401 --> 02:49:44.610
<v Speaker 2>all the meditation and tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have way more,</v>

4077
02:49:44.670 --> 02:49:47.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnection from your body.</v>

4078
02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.143
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It disconnects your mind and your </v>

4079
02:49:51.451 --> 02:49:53.880
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and your ideas from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical frame.</v>

4080
02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what people are trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they meditate.</v>

4081
02:49:56.071 --> 02:49:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you're trying to sit down in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable spot and just concentrate on</v>

4082
02:49:59.641 --> 02:50:00.474
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts and you absolutely can </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve these amazing states of mind in </v>

4083
02:50:03.781 --> 02:50:04.614
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like those states are </v>

4084
02:50:06.090 --> 02:50:06.923
<v Speaker 2>elevated substantially from the tank and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone I know that disagrees is never </v>

4085
02:50:09.781 --> 02:50:10.614
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tank.</v>

4086
02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:12.450
<v Speaker 2>People that have done the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4087
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:16.170
<v Speaker 2>People that know that meditate and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tank as well go,</v>

4088
02:50:16.171 --> 02:50:17.670
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a game changer.</v>

4089
02:50:17.671 --> 02:50:18.504
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a completely different </v>

4090
02:50:19.021 --> 02:50:20.070
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people,</v>

4091
02:50:20.071 --> 02:50:20.904
<v Speaker 2>the people that resist that have talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a few people that meditate and </v>

4092
02:50:22.861 --> 02:50:23.700
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you meditate?</v>

4093
02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

4094
02:50:24.450 --> 02:50:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meditate in my tank.</v>

4095
02:50:26.161 --> 02:50:26.671
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

4096
02:50:26.671 --> 02:50:27.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4097
02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:28.513
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking hippie know what you're </v>

4098
02:50:30.301 --> 02:50:32.340
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've meditated regular to.</v>

4099
02:50:32.570 --> 02:50:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you tried it?</v>

4100
02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:34.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have it.</v>

4101
02:50:34.530 --> 02:50:36.330
<v Speaker 2>They shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>

4102
02:50:36.390 --> 02:50:37.223
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complete naturally occurring </v>

4103
02:50:39.511 --> 02:50:41.820
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anybody who's sober,</v>

4104
02:50:41.821 --> 02:50:44.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody doesn't want to fuck with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell them,</v>

4105
02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:48.660
<v Speaker 2>get in that God damn tank and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a drug experience without any drugs</v>

4106
02:50:48.810 --> 02:50:50.570
<v Speaker 2>or you don't have to worry about losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

4107
02:50:50.571 --> 02:50:51.404
<v Speaker 2>You have to worry about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to worry about overdosing or </v>

4108
02:50:53.221 --> 02:50:55.110
<v Speaker 2>getting something to give you the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

4109
02:50:55.410 --> 02:50:56.243
<v Speaker 2>You can get in that tank and </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimately have a psychedelic </v>

4110
02:50:58.951 --> 02:50:59.784
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

4111
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.741
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4112
02:51:00.741 --> 02:51:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I got to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do well.</v>

4113
02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:04.580
<v Speaker 1>The big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna sound.</v>

4114
02:51:04.581 --> 02:51:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to sound.</v>

4115
02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:08.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my realizations this month are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to sound very,</v>

4116
02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:09.853
<v Speaker 1>very childish and pedestrian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like one of my really hard things </v>

4117
02:51:12.471 --> 02:51:15.410
<v Speaker 1>was going to sleep like I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call them unassisted,</v>

4118
02:51:15.411 --> 02:51:18.050
<v Speaker 1>sleeps in our house so we can go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep without drugs or alcohol.</v>

4119
02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And I had seven this year total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled down fucking 13 in a row.</v>

4120
02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And so now the idea of sleep doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic me the way it used to.</v>

4121
02:51:28.490 --> 02:51:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I did a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

4122

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young ladies and then I just,</v>

4123
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

4124
02:51:34.431 --> 02:51:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bed now and I got in bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just closed my eyes.</v>

4125
02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:39.890
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're healthy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4127
02:51:41.121 --> 02:51:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bed now.</v>

02:51:43.350 --> 02:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really am.</v>

4129
02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:49.100
<v Speaker 2>This is what you've done is considering </v>
<v Speaker 2>your lifestyle.</v>

4130
02:51:49.101 --> 02:51:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And how long you've been doing it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

4132
02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:54.493

<v Speaker 2>competition that sort of motivated you </v>

4133
02:51:57.351 --> 02:51:58.820
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of people would have done it,</v>

4134
02:51:58.821 --> 02:52:00.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people would have quit by now.</v>

4135
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:04.760
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people would have found some </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuses or figured out some way like,</v>

4136
02:52:04.761 --> 02:52:06.010

<v Speaker 4>Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We should do.</v>

4176
02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's willing to do yoga </v>
<v Speaker 4>after this challenge.</v>

4177
02:53:33.811 --> 02:53:36.990
<v Speaker 4>I think this challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for um,</v>

4178
02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:38.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think you will.</v>

4179
02:53:39.470 --> 02:53:43.970
<v Speaker 4>I love that he calls it a chore to set </v>
<v Speaker 4>my alarm because I had a george today.</v>

4180
02:53:44.220 --> 02:53:46.680
<v Speaker 4>Did you listen to his podcast when he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it?</v>

4181
02:53:46.681 --> 02:53:50.610
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a goddamn professional comedian.</v>

4182
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:53.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Jewish entertainer in New York </v>
<v Speaker 4>City.</v>

4183
02:53:55.080 --> 02:54:00.080
<v Speaker 4>He liked to drink and do drugs because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this mock anger is so awesome.</v>

4184
02:54:00.430 --> 02:54:03.350
<v Speaker 4>If I was howling laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driving the girl's house,</v>

4185
02:54:03.370 --> 02:54:04.203
<v Speaker 4>I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

4186
02:54:04.350 --> 02:54:06.150
<v Speaker 4>have you been living in North podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4187
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:08.370
<v Speaker 4>we don't realize the latest one was 35 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes ago.</v>

4188
02:54:08.390 --> 02:54:11.580
<v Speaker 4>It's 35 minutes of gold for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4189
02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:13.620
<v Speaker 4>sort of everyone's list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should listen.</v>

4190
02:54:13.621 --> 02:54:15.930
<v Speaker 4>I think it's meant for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4191
02:54:15.931 --> 02:54:18.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad he decided to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome stuff.</v>

4192
02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:21.040
<v Speaker 1>He was the one that said no weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the one he,</v>

4193
02:54:21.210 --> 02:54:24.180
<v Speaker 1>he texted me personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goes personally,</v>

4194
02:54:24.190 --> 02:54:25.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you and if you're going to do no </v>

4195
02:54:27.601 --> 02:54:28.434
<v Speaker 1>booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take away the thing I care </v>

4196
02:54:29.161 --> 02:54:31.930
<v Speaker 1>about and that's weed and then he and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he texted that to me,</v>

4197
02:54:31.931 --> 02:54:35.090
<v Speaker 1>him and Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I made that video of me running</v>

4198
02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:38.400
<v Speaker 1>thing and in it and I was like no weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said to Tom and Tom was like,</v>

4199
02:54:38.401 --> 02:54:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if joe knows about no weed </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

4200
02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

4201
02:54:41.851 --> 02:54:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing no weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then always like,</v>

4202
02:54:43.741 --> 02:54:45.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bullied him into a corner and see if I</v>

4203
02:54:45.271 --> 02:54:46.104
<v Speaker 1>can get them to do it.</v>

4204
02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:48.990
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't affecting me at all.</v>

4205
02:54:48.991 --> 02:54:50.460
<v Speaker 4>The bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was hilarious.</v>

4206
02:54:50.461 --> 02:54:52.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was willing to do it because I was</v>

4207
02:54:52.981 --> 02:54:53.814
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4208
02:54:53.850 --> 02:54:55.230
<v Speaker 4>well two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought one,</v>

4209
02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:56.573
<v Speaker 4>the optics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't look good if I'm telling you </v>

4210
02:54:58.111 --> 02:55:00.780
<v Speaker 4>guys to quit the booze and then when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to the weed,</v>

4211
02:55:00.781 --> 02:55:01.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4212
02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:02.790
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't a part of the deal,</v>

4213
02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:04.010
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want people to</v>

4214
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:07.880
<v Speaker 2>know that it's not hard to quit weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really easy and yeah,</v>

4215
02:55:07.881 --> 02:55:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm only quoting it for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you it's fucking easy.</v>

4216
02:55:12.261 --> 02:55:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Like it has literally changed nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my life.</v>

4217
02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do all the same things.</v>

4218
02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I think marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like anything can be abused,</v>

4219
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:23.054
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's a valuable tool </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think as long as you use it as a </v>

4220
02:55:26.421 --> 02:55:29.240
<v Speaker 2>tool and I think one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this experience,</v>

4221
02:55:29.250 --> 02:55:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to use it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>judiciously.</v>

4222
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
