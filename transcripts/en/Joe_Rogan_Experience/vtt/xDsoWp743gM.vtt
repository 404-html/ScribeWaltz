<v Speaker 2>And you invented this?</v>

44
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I started the company,</v>

45
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.081
<v Speaker 2>I started the company.</v>

46
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I bought one of those dms,</v>

47
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever heard of those.</v>

48
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It's called deep muscle stimulator.</v>

49
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of talking about that before.</v>

50
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.531
<v Speaker 2>And I said save this,</v>

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.594
<v Speaker 2>So what is that?</v>

54
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 2>The deep muscle stimulator.</v>

55
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like a stainless steel high powered massager that you have to plugin.</v>

56
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It cost me three grand.</v>

57
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.703
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>

58
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 2>It had a really bad Sadeka for two years.</v>

59
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I almost stopped training.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really sad and okay this is going to help you out.</v>

62
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Big Time comes and goes big time.</v>

63
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was,</v>

64
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I was so bad I couldn't sleep like I could not sleep because I was just go all</v>

65
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.041
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

66
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I get mine in my calf sometimes really lucky all the way down to the calf for</v>

67
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>some weird reason me and went down to the hamstring and it stopped there.</v>

68
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

69
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I was able to stop the problem there,</v>

70
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 2>but they say you can go all the way down to the calf.</v>

71
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:10.731
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

72
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 2>that's getting bad,</v>

73
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 2>get my cat right now.</v>

75
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 2>So I bought that.</v>

76
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:16.934
<v Speaker 3>Mess.</v>

78
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.001
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

79
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

80
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 3>that's the DMS.</v>

81
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Great,</v>

82
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.320
<v Speaker 3>great machine,</v>

83
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.321
<v Speaker 3>great machine.</v>

84
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 3>But it overheats.</v>

85
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 3>It costs three grand.</v>

86
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 3>And what does that Piston Dude,</v>

87
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 3>is it hammer you or how much do you it has this like this.</v>

88
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

89
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 3>but it has a lesser travel.</v>

90
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>This one has a greater travel.</v>

91
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 3>So that one,</v>

92
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 3>the DMS is a little bit to vibration.</v>

93
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not as much travel.</v>

94
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not as much percussion.</v>

95
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Percussion is which you're looking for.</v>

96
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 3>And so when I got together with a company from the u s disrupt,</v>

97
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 3>we put together the Tim Tam.</v>

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.301

103
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.570

104
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>This was the best one.</v>

105
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.540

112
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 4>These should be flying off the chart.</v>

113
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't even need drones.</v>

114
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 4>They should just be flying themselves.</v>

115
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.400
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

116

139
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like we tried so many other type of machines,</v>

140
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 4>but they're all overheat week,</v>

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 4>they're not efficient.</v>

143
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 4>The most efficient is already been created.</v>

144
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 4>So we just retooled it.</v>

145
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 4>We just re changed it.</v>

146
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 4>We made it so that it's a,</v>

148
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 4>There's some modifications made,</v>

149
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:50.801
<v Speaker 4>but that's it.</v>

150
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's pretty simple.</v>

151
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:51.951
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

152
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 4>it's the most efficient type of design they have.</v>

153
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

154
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of,</v>

155
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to find someone who can massage you correctly.</v>

156
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to find someone as good.</v>

157
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.861
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

158
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Someone who could really break up the tissue.</v>

159
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 4>But even if you do like what this thing can do,</v>

160
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 4>this thing is like vibrating you and shaking everything loose and I have a,</v>

161
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 4>I have a cone tip I got to send you.</v>

162
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 4>It's even goes even deeper.</v>

163
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 4>So if he can handle deep tissue,</v>

164
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to send you a bunch of them.</v>

165
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

166
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

167
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.361
<v Speaker 4>you're going to love it.</v>

168
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 4>We have also cold tip,</v>

169
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 4>hot tip.</v>

170
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:21.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

171
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 4>it's of your freezer.</v>

172
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 4>You can freeze them because that helps kill the pain.</v>

173
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 4>So if you have an acute acute injury like an after like a week or two and you</v>

174
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 4>want to start working on it,</v>

175
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 4>the cold of the tip helps numb the pain.</v>

176
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 4>It helps manage pain a little more and the hot tip helps loosen up the muscle a</v>

177
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:36.094
<v Speaker 4>little further.</v>

178
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 4>I mostly used the content,</v>

179
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 4>the context for those who have the,</v>

180
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 4>your experience with massage,</v>

181
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.421
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

182
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:40.691
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

183
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 4>you're able to go deep tissue and uh,</v>

184
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 4>for some people that hurts.</v>

185
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:44.461
<v Speaker 4>For me it's,</v>

186
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:44.841
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

187
00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 4>it's perfect.</v>

188
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

189
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 4>So you find like where the scar tissue is actually break it up.</v>

190
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.991
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

191
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 4>The surface area on the quantum is obviously smaller so it goes even deeper and,</v>

192
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

193
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 4>and unlocks that muscle real quick.</v>

194
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.961
<v Speaker 4>So for me,</v>

195
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't have the time for foam rolling.</v>

196
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

197
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 4>that's the main reason why I,</v>

198
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 4>I wanted a product like this cause foam rolling takes forever to break to really</v>

199
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 4>loosen up a muscle and I'm in the gym all day.</v>

200
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Do I want to stay in the gym another hour rolling up and down on a,</v>

201
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.214
<v Speaker 4>on a foam roller.</v>

202
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 4>I think you got to do something though,</v>

203
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

204
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

205
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:11.681
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

206
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Kind of have to do something.</v>

207
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 4>If you're training hard and you want to train for life,</v>

208
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 4>do you use those?</v>

209
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

210
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 4>We don't have one in the room,</v>

211
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 4>but the reason those,</v>

212
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.264
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

213
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.700
<v Speaker 4>what are they calling supernova?</v>

214
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Look a little cross bog balls,</v>

215
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's larger and it's like a big blue one.</v>

216
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.551
<v Speaker 4>I love that thing.</v>

217
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 4>It's rogue makes it,</v>

218
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 4>that fucker gets in there,</v>

219
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 4>but this is even better than that.</v>

220
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 4>This thing is incredible.</v>

221
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 4>I like the ball for my back.</v>

222
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 4>When I do my back,</v>

223
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 4>I feel like in light down on it,</v>

224
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I can get the pressure I want,</v>

225
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 4>but when I use,</v>

226
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 4>when I do my legs,</v>

227
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:41.734
<v Speaker 4>I used the Tim time.</v>

228
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

229
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 4>When I go on the road,</v>

230
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I bring that ball with me and I'll put it on the ground in a hotel room and I</v>

231
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 4>bridge on it just like hit like certain spots to amazing pop everything loose</v>

232
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 4>and you need a lot of body weight.</v>

233
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I put a kettle bell on my chest and you get even deeper.</v>

234
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

235
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

236
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

237
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 5>you could really unlock a muscle like this.</v>

238
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:00.981
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

239
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.700
<v Speaker 5>it could really get in there and really unlock it for people who train.</v>

240
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.071
<v Speaker 5>They know,</v>

241
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:04.500
<v Speaker 5>you know when you,</v>

242
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 5>what'd you get out of that nagging tight muscle in your neck and your shoulder,</v>

243
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.054
<v Speaker 5>your shoulder blades.</v>

244
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

245
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.171
<v Speaker 5>And then you're on the mat.</v>

246
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 5>You do a quick movement,</v>

247
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

248
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 5>that's scary.</v>

249
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 5>So I did it once in the shower or it's something going on in my neck or gas and</v>

250
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize how bad it was and I turned the shower to get something and</v>

251
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 5>then for like days I was locked up.</v>

252
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 5>I've had that done also,</v>

253
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

254
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 5>it's all about keeping the muscles loose.</v>

255
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

256
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Good posture.</v>

257
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.771
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

258
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 5>Kelly started wrote a book,</v>

259
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:29.700
<v Speaker 5>you had him on on the show.</v>

260
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 5>He's really amazing guy.</v>

261
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 5>He's great.</v>

262
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 5>He really changed my life.</v>

263
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 5>Honestly.</v>

264
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 5>I have to,</v>

265
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of reading his book,</v>

266
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:34.521
<v Speaker 5>supple Leopard.</v>

267
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 5>I know all my,</v>

268
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

269
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 5>everybody who knows me follows me.</v>

270
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:37.851
<v Speaker 5>They know.</v>

271
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 5>I always talk about this book,</v>

272
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

273
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 5>he said something so important.</v>

274
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.121
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

275
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:41.271
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

276
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 5>it comes down to two things.</v>

277
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Good alignment and loose muscles.</v>

278
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 5>You got to keep your body aligned and loose muscles and a,</v>

279
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 5>I just followed those two principles.</v>

280
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:49.661
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

281
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:50.331
<v Speaker 5>his book is really,</v>

282
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:51.164
<v Speaker 5>really excellent.</v>

283
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 5>And when I saw his,</v>

284
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.591
<v Speaker 5>when I read his book,</v>

285
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:57.950
<v Speaker 5>that's when I reached out to him to work with George because he,</v>

286
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've ever seen,</v>

287
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 5>when George does a back flip and he lands,</v>

288
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:00.921
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

289
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 5>and he's always kind of come in together.</v>

290
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 5>If you ever see like watch him do a backflip that's called the,</v>

291
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:07.590
<v Speaker 5>I was reading his book and I saw that's the vulgus fault.</v>

292
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 5>He calls that the Volk is fault when you're,</v>

293
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 5>when you do a squat in your knees,</v>

294
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 5>come close to one another.</v>

295
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.081
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

296
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 5>that took him cause ACL tears.</v>

297
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

298
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 5>I know a guy with two ACL tears and he does that all the time.</v>

299
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 5>I see him do that all the time.</v>

300
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 5>It's something I've always noticed about George.</v>

301
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 5>He's knees always bow.</v>

302
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 5>And when we do lifts,</v>

303
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:21.981
<v Speaker 5>when we do jumps,</v>

304
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:22.814
<v Speaker 5>when we do hurdles,</v>

305
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

306
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:24.010
<v Speaker 5>I've watched Jay,</v>

307
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Georgia jumped up and done literally thousands of times and I saw his knees</v>

308
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 5>battling all the time and he's like,</v>

309
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

310
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 5>then I reached out to him.</v>

311
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.911
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

312
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.061
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

313
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 5>could you help me correct Georges?</v>

314
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.861
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

315
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 5>That's the vault,</v>

316
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.123
<v Speaker 5>his fault.</v>

317
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.601
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

318
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

319
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 5>And ever since then,</v>

320
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 5>Georgia needs it had been a lot better and we still do to fix it.</v>

321
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 5>Well what he does,</v>

322
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 5>it's a technical skill.</v>

323
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.691
<v Speaker 5>It's a skill.</v>

324
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:45.171
<v Speaker 5>So he does,</v>

325
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 5>he has a few different exercises to help you correct it.</v>

326
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 5>So you put a band around your knees and you kind of push out on the band.</v>

327
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 5>But really what we do is we'll make Georgia do a lift or a jump film it,</v>

328
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 5>send it to Kelly and he'll tell us how aligned we are and what directions to go.</v>

329
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 5>So he kind of coaches us on how to avoid,</v>

330
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

331
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

332
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.071
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

333
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

334
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:01.640
<v Speaker 5>fault.</v>

335
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 5>However it really,</v>

336
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.021
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>

337
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 5>it's about keeping your knees turn to the outside.</v>

338
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 5>I used to walk up the stairs and have needs in my pain in my knee.</v>

339
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 5>You ever have that when you walk upstairs?</v>

340
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

341
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 5>I used to have pain in my knee walking up the stairs and that was from stairs</v>

342
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 5>just from walking upstairs and I didn't know why.</v>

343
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 5>And then when I read his book and he's like,</v>

344
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:17.541
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

345
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 5>when you walk up a step,</v>

346
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 5>you got to keep your toes straight to and turn your knee out.</v>

347
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.531
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

348
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:22.364
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

349
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 5>And I started doing that.</v>

350
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 5>My pain was gone immediately.</v>

351
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Keep your toe straight,</v>

352
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:27.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

353
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Like toes turn your knee out,</v>

354
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 5>turn you need to the outside.</v>

355
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:30.501
<v Speaker 5>So he says,</v>

356
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

357
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 5>this is your,</v>

358
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.503
<v Speaker 5>this is your ACL.</v>

359
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.023
<v Speaker 5>See this year,</v>

360
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.871
<v Speaker 5>this is your ACL.</v>

361
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Cross your ECL,</v>

362
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.211
<v Speaker 5>ECL,</v>

363
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 5>you put it in your kneecap,</v>

364
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.313
<v Speaker 5>that's your knee.</v>

365
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 5>When you turn your knee to the outside,</v>

366
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:41.991
<v Speaker 5>look at,</v>

367
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.824
<v Speaker 5>tightens it up.</v>

368
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 5>That takes away all the slack.</v>

369
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 5>So what happens when you're going up the,</v>

370
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 5>when you're going up the stairs,</v>

371
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:47.841
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

372
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.081
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

373
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

374
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 5>your ACL is just jiggling around and getting sheered.</v>

375
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 5>When when you tighten it up,</v>

376
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 5>you go up,</v>

377
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.363
<v Speaker 5>you're secured.</v>

378
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 5>So he calls it creating Torque is a brilliant book.</v>

379
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.063
<v Speaker 5>Mine is brilliant guy.</v>

380
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 5>So even when you run hills,</v>

381
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 5>you should do that.</v>

382
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.131
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

383
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 5>You should always be a,</v>

384
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 5>whenever your body is under pressure or stress,</v>

385
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 5>whether you're wrestling or whatnot,</v>

386
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 5>you should always have torque.</v>

387
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.631
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

388
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:09.811
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

389
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 5>grab your shirt like this.</v>

390
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:10.861
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

391
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:11.440
<v Speaker 5>grab your shirt.</v>

392
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:11.771
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

393
00:09:11.771 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 5>he gives an example in the book.</v>

394
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 5>Excellent example.</v>

395
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 5>So now grab the shirt and twist it here.</v>

396
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Create torque.</v>

397
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.663
<v Speaker 5>Now look,</v>

398
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.340
<v Speaker 5>you have a much more uh,</v>

399
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.041
<v Speaker 5>stable grip.</v>

400
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.261
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

401
00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 5>like a judoka is always going to grab the lapels and twist them.</v>

402
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 5>So when you grab the bar,</v>

403
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

404
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 5>you're going to do a bench press.</v>

405
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you know,</v>

406
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 5>it's not the best exercise or not,</v>

407
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 5>but the principles still at work,</v>

408
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.361
<v Speaker 5>when you got the bar,</v>

409
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 5>you should be torquing the bomb most.</v>

410
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 5>When you're doing pushups,</v>

411
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 5>your hands are on the mat and you're torquing even though your hands are not</v>

412
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:37.651
<v Speaker 5>turning,</v>

413
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 5>literally you just torquing.</v>

414
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.601
<v Speaker 5>When you do that,</v>

415
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 5>you feel that all the slack is eaten up,</v>

416
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.721
<v Speaker 5>there's no more slack,</v>

417
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 5>there's no more a trampoline effect.</v>

418
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:45.361
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

419
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:46.111
<v Speaker 5>there's no more jiggling.</v>

420
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:46.681
<v Speaker 5>Everything's tight,</v>

421
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 5>the system is tight and it's very,</v>

422
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 5>very important that the system be tight and then the weight beyond the muscles.</v>

423
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 5>So if you're properly aligned,</v>

424
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing a maneuver,</v>

425
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 5>the weight is on the bone,</v>

426
00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 5>not on attendance.</v>

427
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.391
<v Speaker 5>So if you put your,</v>

428
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 5>put your weight like this on your fingers,</v>

429
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that the bone is carrying the word.</v>

430
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 5>If you bent,</v>

431
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 5>if you bend your bones here,</v>

432
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:06.381
<v Speaker 5>look at,</v>

433
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:06.511
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

434
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 5>if you're on the line and you start putting pressure,</v>

435
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Speaker 5>nice,</v>

436
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 5>your muscles are starting to work overtime.</v>

437
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 5>So when I'm carrying weight,</v>

438
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 5>I need to,</v>

439
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 5>I need to have it on my bones and or my muscles,</v>

440
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 5>never on the tendons and ligaments,</v>

441
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

442
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 5>they can then share with backpackers,</v>

443
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.651
<v Speaker 5>backpackers,</v>

444
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:20.441
<v Speaker 5>do they,</v>

445
00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

446
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 5>they keep their legs as stiff as possible and they take short,</v>

447
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.610
<v Speaker 5>like sort of short steps.</v>

448
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Like guys who are mountain near guys,</v>

449
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 5>they don't take like big high steps.</v>

450
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 5>They kind of keep their legs stiff and they walk with their skeleton,</v>

451
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

452
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 5>If trying to let their scale and see me,</v>

453
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting on this chair,</v>

454
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 5>this chair has no muscles,</v>

455
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 5>but it's holding me up because of the structure structures,</v>

456
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 5>that type of,</v>

457
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.890
<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>

458
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.441
<v Speaker 5>strength.</v>

459
00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:44.561
<v Speaker 5>Though.</v>

460
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 5>If you take an egg and you try to squeeze it in a certain way,</v>

461
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:46.951
<v Speaker 5>you can't break it.</v>

462
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:47.131
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

463
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 5>you ever seen that experiment?</v>

464
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.811
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

465
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 5>Because you're actually trying to crush a cylinder to crush a sinner.</v>

466
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:53.310
<v Speaker 5>That takes a tremendous amount of force.</v>

467
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:53.641
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

468
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 5>to break a stick and half takes very little amount of force.</v>

469
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

470
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.353
<v Speaker 5>And has a lot to do with the,</v>

471
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.141
<v Speaker 5>with the structure.</v>

472
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 5>If you're trying to compress manner on itself,</v>

473
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:01.501
<v Speaker 5>it won't,</v>

474
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 5>it won't.</v>

475
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.690
<v Speaker 5>It take a tremendous amount of force to do that.</v>

476
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.763
<v Speaker 5>Tremendous,</v>

477
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 5>tremendous amount of power.</v>

478
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.321
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

479
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:11.880
<v Speaker 5>if you want to separate the material by bending it at the middle,</v>

480
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.481
<v Speaker 5>it very easy.</v>

481
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 5>But to compress it,</v>

482
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 5>to compress material on itself,</v>

483
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 5>it takes,</v>

484
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 5>would take a tremendous amount of energy.</v>

485
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 5>So anytime you're going outside of your alignment,</v>

486
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 5>you're allowing things to compress.</v>

487
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

488
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>That's why it makes so much sense to keep your leg straight when you're hiking.</v>

489
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.291
<v Speaker 5>It's like a horse.</v>

490
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:25.861
<v Speaker 5>It sleeps right?</v>

491
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:26.694
<v Speaker 5>He's sleeping.</v>

492
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 5>If he aligns his legs perfectly straight,</v>

493
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 5>he's using structure to hold him up instead of muscular strength.</v>

494
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.181
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

495
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:33.481
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

496
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 5>and he,</v>

497
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 5>I remember he had,</v>

498
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 5>you had them on the show and you guys had a very interesting uh,</v>

499
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.933
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

500
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 5>conversation and he was talking about front squatting will make you have a great</v>

501
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:42.360
<v Speaker 5>guard.</v>

502
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 5>But I think you guys miss misunderstood each other actually cause you were like,</v>

503
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:45.271
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

504
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 5>France squatting has nothing to do with it.</v>

505
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 5>Have a great garden.</v>

506
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:47.351
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

507
00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 5>and I agree with both of you,</v>

508
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:49.224
<v Speaker 5>but I think you guys,</v>

509
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 5>we're not talking about the exact same thing he's talking about having the</v>

510
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:53.214
<v Speaker 5>mobility</v>

511
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 2>to squat down really low and the front squat,</v>

512
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll help you regard not necessarily having a big lift,</v>

513
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily,</v>

514
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't talking about heavy lifting.</v>

515
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 2>300 pounds in the front squat is gonna make you a great guard player that that's</v>

516
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:05.884
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

517
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I think what he was talking about is having credible and mobility in your hips.</v>

518
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 2>You ever see a child pick up something off the floor like a newborn baby?</v>

519
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get into this perfect,</v>

520
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 2>perfect squat.</v>

521
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:15.881
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

522
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:16.091
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

523
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 2>if you look at guard players,</v>

524
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>the best guard players always have incredible flexibility in their hips,</v>

525
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

526
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Because I always tell people that the higher you can bring your hips to your</v>

527
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:23.944
<v Speaker 2>chest,</v>

528
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>the hardest for me to pass your guard.</v>

529
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're one of those guys were,</v>

530
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 2>were your knees like this,</v>

531
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:27.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to regard and you need it this far.</v>

533
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's the space for me to pass your guard is huge.</v>

534
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 2>But if you can bring this foot behind your head and your hymns,</v>

536
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.370
<v Speaker 2>it's the window.</v>

537
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 2>The space that I need to cross to get to side control is so small.</v>

538
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

539
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.823
<v Speaker 2>Eddie has a,</v>

540
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.791
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

541
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:43.421
<v Speaker 2>one of his students,</v>

542
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:46.560
<v Speaker 2>his name's Sean Ballinger and he has crazy [inaudible].</v>

543
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.081
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him,</v>

544
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the double a.</v>

545
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 2>He could do double lotus and literally take his legs and put them behind his</v>

546
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

547
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

548
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean he could just pull those lines back.</v>

549
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

550
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 2>how many great guard players have you seen who can do that?</v>

551
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Swearing like Ryan Hall for instance.</v>

552
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.021
<v Speaker 2>Keenan,</v>

554
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have this flexibility to them.</v>

555
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Passing the guards becomes very,</v>

556
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:06.110
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

557
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.881
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible.</v>

558
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:07.481
<v Speaker 2>Almost impossible.</v>

559
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:10.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like they just spend a little bit and you're back in something again and</v>

560
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

561
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 2>you're tying up and then you in leg locks and you're kind of fucked anxieties</v>

562
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:16.370
<v Speaker 2>there as they're spinning to your leg while you're trying to pass their guard.</v>

563
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.390
<v Speaker 2>And hip flexibility is so paramount in Jujitsu for bottom game especially.</v>

564
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's so devastating when you have a hip injury,</v>

565
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.950
<v Speaker 2>hip injuries and you know,</v>

566
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I know guys who have had hip replacements and it's like,</v>

567
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.154
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

568
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.051
<v Speaker 2>then you're,</v>

570
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 2>you're so severely limited in what you can do afterwards.</v>

571
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 2>You got to never let it get there.</v>

572
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:36.424
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion,</v>

573
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.181
<v Speaker 2>according to Kelly,</v>

574
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 2>he says your joints can last you a 120 years.</v>

575
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take care of them.</v>

576
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 2>He said there's 2% catastrophe,</v>

577
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 2>meaning you got hit by a bus.</v>

578
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:44.981
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

579
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 2>that's something we can,</v>

580
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 2>we can't do anything about.</v>

581
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 2>98% of the time is because you didn't take care of your joints,</v>

582
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 2>you haven't,</v>

583
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you haven't properly use them and you let muscles get tight for too long over a</v>

584
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:56.021
<v Speaker 2>long period of time.</v>

585
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:56.771
<v Speaker 2>So for me personally,</v>

586
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when I was 20,</v>

587
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I feel better now than when I was 25.</v>

588
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.121
<v Speaker 2>He's at 25.</v>

589
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 2>I was really beat up 26,</v>

590
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:02.981
<v Speaker 2>27.</v>

591
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:03.814
<v Speaker 2>I was really like,</v>

592
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.541
<v Speaker 2>hey my knees,</v>

593
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:04.961
<v Speaker 2>my back,</v>

594
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:05.471
<v Speaker 2>my neck,</v>

595
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:05.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

596
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 2>training everyday.</v>

597
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Twice a day it was grueling.</v>

598
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 2>But after I went through that system,</v>

599
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I came back out fresh and now whenever I have a little tweak or anything like</v>

600
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:13.331
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

601
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I take care of it immediately.</v>

602
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I kill it.</v>

603
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't let any tweak creep up,</v>

604
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Go Gore he further and uh,</v>

605
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel much more energy.</v>

606
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.461
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>

607
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 2>when I keep that,</v>

608
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 2>the body healthier Louis,</v>

609
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 2>I feel a lot more energy.</v>

610
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel better.</v>

611
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>My mood is better.</v>

612
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:26.921
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

613
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 2>it's the balance between being tough and,</v>

614
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.271
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

615
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:34.030
<v Speaker 2>being mentally strong enough to like push through training when you're,</v>

616
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you're not feeling your best and knowing that you're fucking up your vehicle</v>

618
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 2>when you're knowing that you're fucking up your body.</v>

619
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.983
<v Speaker 2>Very true.</v>

620
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.411
<v Speaker 2>Very true.</v>

621
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a balance hard for fighters in particular because they want to be tough,</v>

622
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.881
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

623
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>So you've got some weird little thing in new leg or whatever.</v>

624
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to work through it and just were,</v>

625
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:50.501
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

626
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to like that,</v>

627
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>

628
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 2>People who say they're going to go,</v>

629
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:57.630
<v Speaker 2>like you go light and then you get tagged and then you want to get some of that</v>

630
00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 2>and the next thing you know you're not going light.</v>

631
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And then that thing and your leg,</v>

632
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it's all fucked up.</v>

633
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know,</v>

634
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you go to a doctor and know you have an MCL tear.</v>

635
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

636
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.643
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

637
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

638
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 2>And then what that tightness that's,</v>

639
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it gets worse after,</v>

640
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 2>after 48 hours,</v>

641
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.044
<v Speaker 2>you have dlms,</v>

642
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>delayed onset muscle soreness,</v>

643
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.181
<v Speaker 2>and then you're in the shower,</v>

644
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:15.014
<v Speaker 2>you turn your neck,</v>

645
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.321
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

646

<v Speaker 2>something pops.</v>

647
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

648
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

649
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.560
<v Speaker 2>What do you do in terms of dictates or Cunanan or cocoon.</v>

650
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Cocoon.</v>

651
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:22.791
<v Speaker 2>That's how you say it,</v>

652
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

653
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.020
<v Speaker 2>Kirk Koonin,</v>

654
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.973
<v Speaker 2>Tumeric,</v>

655
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 2>anti-inflammatory,</v>

656
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.370
<v Speaker 2>herbs and things along those lines.</v>

658
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.541
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>

659
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

660
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.861
<v Speaker 2>there was Rhonda,</v>

661
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Patrick just put something up about,</v>

662
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you see,</v>

664
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I think you called curcumin circling or Kirk Kirk Cunanan.</v>

665
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

666
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.020
<v Speaker 2>it's Tumeric.</v>

667
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 2>It's the active ingredient in tumeric and she just puts something up on her,</v>

668
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 2>a Twitter page a couple of days ago about how important this stuff is and to</v>

669
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:51.890
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you have a bioavailable,</v>

670
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.900
<v Speaker 2>improves memory and mood as well.</v>

671
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

672
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:54.971
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to try it.</v>

673
00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried it.</v>

674
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:55.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

675
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just to Merrick.</v>

676
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

677
00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.251
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

678
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>and that stuff is fantastic for inflammation.</v>

679
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 2>People that have soreness and you know,</v>

680
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>like nagging injuries and nagging inflammation,</v>

681
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 2>having that as a part of your daily diet is fantastic.</v>

682
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Along with fish oil.</v>

683
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Fish oil is really good for that,</v>

684
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:14.421
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

686
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:18.380
<v Speaker 2>And then watching your diet and making sure you're low and inflammatory foods</v>

687
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 2>like sugar and alcohol and really it's amazing how much of a difference it</v>

688
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:23.570
<v Speaker 2>makes.</v>

689
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Huge if you have any sort of a back injury or inflammation.</v>

690
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I talked to this lady who was a therapist a few years back and she was saying,</v>

691
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

692
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you should really try going gluten free if you have issues with your,</v>

693
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

694
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.421
<v Speaker 2>with your back.</v>

695
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:35.721
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

696
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:36.060
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

697
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.040
<v Speaker 2>this wacky pitch,</v>

698
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was thinking.</v>

699
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.000
<v Speaker 2>All those things.</v>

700
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

701
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:40.431
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

702
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:41.520
<v Speaker 2>she's talking woo woo,</v>

703
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Woo Crystal's nonsense.</v>

704
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.451
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

705
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

706
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.381
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

707
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Gluten.</v>

708
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.491
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

709
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 2>you'd be amazed at how many people,</v>

710
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

711
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.301
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

712
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:53.780
<v Speaker 2>and now that I've thought about it more and with all I know,</v>

713
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 2>talking to various nutritionists and actual clinical researchers,</v>

714
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it's as much gluten as it is just just sugar,</v>

715
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrate hydrates and refined carbohydrates and sugars and all these</v>

716
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.050
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

717
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Just create inflammation.</v>

718
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.210
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way around it.</v>

719
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Especially the,</v>

720
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>the levels that normal Americans eat a man.</v>

721
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.753
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

722
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

723
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about where the worst,</v>

724
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

725
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

726
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it's tremendous amount of sugar.</v>

727
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

728
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't know it until you get off sugar and then you go see everybody who is</v>

729
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:26.450
<v Speaker 2>eating the standard amount of sugar and you're like,</v>

730
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:27.284
<v Speaker 2>it blows your mind.</v>

731
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

732
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't need that much sugar.</v>

733
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Still Way does it.</v>

734
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just way too much.</v>

735
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:32.300
<v Speaker 2>And you'll feel sick eating that much sugar again.</v>

736
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.961
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>

737
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:33.680
<v Speaker 2>it's mind boggling.</v>

738
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Like a Jug Gatorade,</v>

739
00:17:35.001 --> 00:17:36.730
<v Speaker 2>the love doing drink after practice.</v>

740
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.603
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that down.</v>

741
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you ever seen those,</v>

742
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:43.030
<v Speaker 2>they have those things where they show you a in I'm on uh,</v>

743
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.641
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

744
00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 2>They have like this is the amount of sugar that's in a can of coke.</v>

745
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 2>This is the amount of sugar that's in a 24 bottle of Gatorade.</v>

746
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.740
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>

747
00:17:51.741 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible amount of pile is sugar.</v>

748
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>

749
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like a fist full of sugar,</v>

750
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:56.963
<v Speaker 4>but it's addictive.</v>

751
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

752
00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Customer coming back.</v>

753
00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.620
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

754
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 4>The customer coming back.</v>

755
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 4>You need that next sugar high.</v>

756
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 4>You need a more sugar than next time around and you need another dose of sugar</v>

757
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.911
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>

758
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:06.351
<v Speaker 4>I think you should,</v>

759
00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you should get it from whole foods mostly in.</v>

760
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 4>It gets released in your system naturally.</v>

761
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:10.404
<v Speaker 4>Slowly.</v>

762
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 4>There it is right there.</v>

763
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.031
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

770
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 4>like you bringing coke across the border.</v>

771
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 4>That's just poisonous.</v>

772
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Fucking amazing.</v>

773

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.723
<v Speaker 4>That's impressive.</v>

775
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.931
<v Speaker 4>What does it say?</v>

776
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 4>17 grams.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

784
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 4>It's so much sugar.</v>

785
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Some milk.</v>

786
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

787
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 4>Chocolate milk's supposed to be good after you train though.</v>

788
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 4>White milk to,</v>

789
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:47.960
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

790
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's old news.</v>

791
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

792
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

793
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 4>George used to do that.</v>

794
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:51.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

795
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:52.434
<v Speaker 4>George used to that.</v>

796
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.251
<v Speaker 4>But I'll tell you something.</v>

797
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 4>George is a freak of nature when it comes to diet.</v>

798
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

799
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:55.981
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

800
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:56.820
<v Speaker 4>he's very blessed.</v>

801
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.401
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

802
00:18:57.401 --> 00:18:57.781
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

803
00:18:57.781 --> 00:18:58.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

804
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 4>I think this,</v>

805
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.041
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

806
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 4>this is just my observation,</v>

807
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:01.020
<v Speaker 4>but I think some people,</v>

808
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.203
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

809
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.261
<v Speaker 4>when they eat carbs,</v>

810
00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:04.190
<v Speaker 4>they spike the insulin.</v>

811
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:04.681
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

812
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 4>And they can get fat off if they eat too much carbs.</v>

813
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 4>And some people will eat a tremendous amount of carbs and they never get fat.</v>

814
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.191
<v Speaker 4>And we've all had,</v>

815
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 4>we all have a friend who eats a lot of junk.</v>

816
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.190
<v Speaker 4>Food is ripped.</v>

817
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.800
<v Speaker 4>They're not,</v>

818
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.680
<v Speaker 4>they're not many in the,</v>

819
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

820
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:17.581
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

821
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.414
<v Speaker 4>But they exist.</v>

822
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:18.961
<v Speaker 4>You've all,</v>

823
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 4>we've all met a person like that.</v>

824
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Georgia is one of those guys.</v>

825
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 4>Like if he eats Mcdonald's for a week or he eats vegetables for a week,</v>

826
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:25.051
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

827
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be lean either way.</v>

828
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Now he'd be leaner on vegetables.</v>

829
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 4>But even on Mcdonald's,</v>

830
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:29.551
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be lean.</v>

831
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 4>He's never been fat and his entire career,</v>

832
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.691
<v Speaker 4>his entire life,</v>

833
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:36.090
<v Speaker 4>I should say so I mean get a little heavier.</v>

834
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 4>When he stopped training it look,</v>

835
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.330
<v Speaker 4>cause he took some photos for the UFC.</v>

836
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.710
<v Speaker 4>He looked a little heavier.</v>

837
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.401
<v Speaker 4>Bulky,</v>

838
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:42.234
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>

839
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 4>Would you say that he's Chubby?</v>

840
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

841
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

842
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:44.930
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

843
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I saw him at the beach.</v>

844
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say we like this guy's shredded,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

853
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.270

<v Speaker 4>I would be fat.</v>

855
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.261
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

856

<v Speaker 4>You won't.</v>

869
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.200

870
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.840

876
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.850
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] this doesn't get it.</v>

877
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I've like,</v>

878
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I've trained thousands of people.</v>

879
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.061
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

880
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:14.190
<v Speaker 4>He's trained himself like he thinks that way.</v>

881
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 4>He went,</v>

882
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>

883
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.280
<v Speaker 4>What he did is we're going to work for everyone.</v>

884
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.320
<v Speaker 4>And I love Georgia Super Intelligent Guy,</v>

885
00:20:19.321 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 4>but I tell him during the week,</v>

886
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 4>like he's very gifted when it comes to food and he does a lot of things and like</v>

887
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.190
<v Speaker 4>now he's doing a lot of fasting and he's getting even leaner,</v>

888
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 4>but it would be a long time for Georgia's fat.</v>

889
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.181
<v Speaker 4>Do you see that there's,</v>

890
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

891
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 4>there's various body types.</v>

892
00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:31.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

893
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 4>you do have ectomorph Mesomorph endomorph and we're,</v>

894
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:35.340
<v Speaker 4>we're uh,</v>

895
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.990
<v Speaker 4>we're on the continuum of these three is on the Ectomorph side and a,</v>

896
00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:39.271
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

897
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:44.271
<v Speaker 4>in a strong sign of ectomorph is a small waist and George has a Mesomorph no</v>

898
00:20:44.391 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 4>mesomorph cause he's very muscular.</v>

899
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.801
<v Speaker 4>He is.</v>

900
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:47.140
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

901
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.811
<v Speaker 4>you become more active,</v>

902
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 4>more Schwab</v>

903
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.800
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

904
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.860
<v Speaker 2>but sorry.</v>

905
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

906
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.833
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

907
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 2>George was very skinny and scrawny when he was young,</v>

908
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 2>so he went crazy on the weights.</v>

909
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 2>He turned his weakness into a strength.</v>

910
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.091
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

911
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 2>that's so much weight,</v>

912
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 2>weight training and exercise because he wanted to bulk up.</v>

913
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 2>So he's a bulk ectomorph now.</v>

914
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 2>He's not a perfect outcome.</v>

915
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>He's not 100% up to more of,</v>

916
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's between Ectomorph Mesomorph,</v>

917
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 2>endomorph the,</v>

918
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the other end of the spectrum.</v>

919
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>You eat a little bit of a carbohydrate to get fat,</v>

920
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:15.820
<v Speaker 2>you lift a little bit of muscles,</v>

921
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:17.600
<v Speaker 2>your muscles explode in size.</v>

922
00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:18.490
<v Speaker 2>The George wasn't like that.</v>

923
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Georgia is a bit on the other side of the spectrum.</v>

924
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>So a real mesomorph would be like Melvin Manhoef.</v>

925
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.241
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

926
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:25.511
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

927
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:25.901
<v Speaker 2>Like that,</v>

928
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:26.734
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm kind of no,</v>

930
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:28.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

931
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:28.141
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

932
00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:28.974
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

933
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.060
<v Speaker 2>That's more uh,</v>

934
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

935
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 2>endomorph endomorph it's fat.</v>

936
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

937
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:35.730
<v Speaker 2>But you could also be very muscular and morph.</v>

938
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:35.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

939
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:36.761
<v Speaker 2>You can be very muscular.</v>

940
00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I thought endomorph is like,</v>

941
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>like people that have a really hard time not being overweight.</v>

942
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.610
<v Speaker 2>You can gain fat and muscle really quickly as an endomorph.</v>

943
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

944
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 2>But ectomorphs from what I've read,</v>

945
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.213
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong.</v>

946
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Neither one of us are biologists.</v>

947
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.673
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

948
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

949
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I always thought Ectomorph is really skinny.</v>

950
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Endomorph was they tend to lean towards being overweight and then Mesomorph for</v>

951
00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 2>someone who's like really like a Francis and Ghana,</v>

952
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 2>not super ma or Brock Lesnar like super muscular,</v>

953
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:04.414
<v Speaker 2>thick,</v>

954
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.900
<v Speaker 2>like just look like they like naturally would pack a lot of mosques.</v>

955
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you could pull up a chart if you,</v>

956
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.710
<v Speaker 2>if you can't,</v>

957
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 2>all these pictures just show both of them from what I,</v>

958
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.220
<v Speaker 2>from what I've read,</v>

959
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>see them as amorphous,</v>

960
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 2>kind of in the middle.</v>

961
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.520
<v Speaker 2>ECTOMORPH is Ilene and hot pack on muscle.</v>

962
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Ectomorph looks like a skinny dork and Mesomorph looks like he's super jacked</v>

963
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 2>and endomorph looks like,</v>

964
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.830
<v Speaker 2>well endomorph endomorph does not look fat in that picture.</v>

965
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have to be fat.</v>

966
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

967
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Now here,</v>

968
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.390
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

969
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something ladies.</v>

970
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.370
<v Speaker 2>When you look at those three pictures,</v>

971
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I go with endomorph all day.</v>

972
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.191
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

973
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Those three pictures,</v>

974
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 2>if that's what an endomorph is,</v>

975
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:40.950
<v Speaker 2>let's take that in the morning.</v>

976
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Because they need a lot of naps and they're always tired.</v>

978
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.160
<v Speaker 2>And those mesomorphs their egos,</v>

979
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>

980
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 2>they want to choke you.</v>

981
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 2>The mesomorph shoulders you want to fucking strangle you.</v>

982
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.421
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

983
00:22:51.421 --> 00:22:51.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

984
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>endomorphs that's a woman.</v>

985
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

986
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you can have a rift endomorph anybody can be ripped.</v>

987
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy's an endomorph.</v>

988
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe think about it in the morph is like a short,</v>

989
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 2>stocky hulk.</v>

990
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I should be fat.</v>

991
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 2>And he could also be packed with muscle,</v>

992
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 2>like the Calvin Kelvin gassed alum,</v>

993
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.311
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Gasol.</v>

994
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:10.660
<v Speaker 2>And he would only put them on the end of the moves and the more site.</v>

995
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:10.961
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

996
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

997
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Because he's never really totally ripped while dolce when he had him and he was</v>

998
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 2>getting them down to a real one 70,</v>

999
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.551
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1000
00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:20.371
<v Speaker 2>he really had,</v>

1001
00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty ripped at one point in time.</v>

1002
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Just really low body.</v>

1003
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 2>You can get ripped.</v>

1004
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just not as easy to get there.</v>

1005
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can get ripped.</v>

1006
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1007
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 2>an ectomorph.</v>

1008
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So think about a basketball player.</v>

1009
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:31.691
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1010
00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>One of the signs they say is small waist.</v>

1011
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.960
<v Speaker 2>The waist and shoulders are quite similar.</v>

1012
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Now George has a v going,</v>

1013
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1014
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 2>is very broad shoulders,</v>

1015
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 2>which is great.</v>

1016
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.110
<v Speaker 2>He's perfectly built for fighting that allows him for reach and his Aa cause</v>

1017
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:45.030
<v Speaker 2>he's got incredible like this.</v>

1018
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing shoulder pads</v>

1019
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.933
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

1020
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.631
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1021
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 4>he's blessed with many,</v>

1022
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:49.000
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

1023
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1024
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1025
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 4>genetic gifts for fighting,</v>

1026
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.243
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it.</v>

1027
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.670
<v Speaker 4>And endomorphs are naturally predisposed,</v>

1028
00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 4>excuse me.</v>

1029
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 4>ECTOMORPHS are naturally predisposed to endurance sports.</v>

1030
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 4>So you'll see a lot of marathon runners or whatnot.</v>

1031
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 4>They're tall and lanky.</v>

1032
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:02.241
<v Speaker 4>They're not short,</v>

1033
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.074
<v Speaker 4>bulky,</v>

1034
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1035
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Mike Tyson type look athletes.</v>

1036
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:07.574
<v Speaker 4>That's a real,</v>

1037
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 4>that's a real,</v>

1038
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 4>that's what I would say.</v>

1039
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 4>Endomorph endomorph because he's so short,</v>

1040
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 4>short and stocky and bulky.</v>

1041
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.040
<v Speaker 4>He could put on a lot of muscle,</v>

1042
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Speaker 4>a lot of fat Nasco.</v>

1043
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.843
<v Speaker 4>Is he a little bit,</v>

1044
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:17.391
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>

1045
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say he's fat,</v>

1046
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:18.911
<v Speaker 4>whether he's,</v>

1047
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 4>he's put on some fat since he's a retired or whatnot.</v>

1048
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1049
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much it works out anymore,</v>

1050
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.481
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1051
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:23.991
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1052
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 4>But an Ectomorph,</v>

1053
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.180
<v Speaker 4>even when they stop working out,</v>

1054
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 4>they're still,</v>

1055
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.980
<v Speaker 4>they're less likely to put pack on fat.</v>

1056
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 4>And I have a little belly,</v>

1057
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:30.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1058
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as as pronounced.</v>

1059
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not as pronounced as an endomorph and more full pack on fat and muscle real</v>

1060
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:37.094
<v Speaker 4>quickly.</v>

1061
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.151
<v Speaker 4>And they're,</v>

1062
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:38.984
<v Speaker 4>they're more,</v>

1063
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:39.770
<v Speaker 4>they're more,</v>

1064
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1065
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 4>they gravitate more towards power sports so they can explode,</v>

1066
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 4>but we'll have less.</v>

1067
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 4>They have less cardio.</v>

1068
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 4>Where's the ECTOMORPH is like,</v>

1069
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:48.650
<v Speaker 4>you'll see a lot of running backs.</v>

1070
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.131
<v Speaker 4>They're short,</v>

1071
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 4>stocky,</v>

1072
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.481
<v Speaker 4>and the morph,</v>

1073
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:50.930
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1074
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 4>they have to explode for three,</v>

1075
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:52.370
<v Speaker 4>four seconds.</v>

1076
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Is there a best body for fighting or is there a,</v>

1077
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 4>do you just adapt your style to whatever body you exactly.</v>

1078
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I think there's the best body for basketball.</v>

1079
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:02.950
<v Speaker 4>The best body for football.</v>

1080
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.430
<v Speaker 4>While it depends on what position you're playing,</v>

1081
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 4>but fighting,</v>

1082
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 4>everybody has an a fight in their DNA.</v>

1083
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 4>So all styles,</v>

1084
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.211
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1085
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:12.830
<v Speaker 4>all body types can fight.</v>

1086
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's so amazing.</v>

1087
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.391
<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>

1088
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:15.141
<v Speaker 4>You got to Paul Harris.</v>

1089
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:16.700
<v Speaker 4>He's an endomorph man,</v>

1090
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 4>but he found a way to fight that make sense for him.</v>

1091
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 4>That's what I always tell people.</v>

1092
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 4>You got to fight according to your,</v>

1093
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.441
<v Speaker 4>your body type.</v>

1094
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:25.310
<v Speaker 4>And people think that's crazy.</v>

1095
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1096
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 4>Muhammad Ali fought a certain way because it has certain attributes.</v>

1097
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.320
<v Speaker 4>He had certain,</v>

1098
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.150
<v Speaker 4>he had certain,</v>

1099
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:31.441
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1100
00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:32.330
<v Speaker 4>a certain personality.</v>

1101
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Even your personalities are important.</v>

1102
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 4>If he tried to fight Mike Tyson,</v>

1103
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 4>it would backfire.</v>

1104
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 4>If Tyson tried to fight like Muhammad Ali,</v>

1105
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 4>it would backfire.</v>

1106
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody has to start with the basics and then after three,</v>

1107
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 4>four years of training,</v>

1108
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 4>even maybe up to five years now,</v>

1109
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 4>you got a specialized for what your temperament is,</v>

1110
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 4>what's your body type is,</v>

1111
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.960
<v Speaker 4>what your personality is.</v>

1112
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 4>Because not everybody wants to get it done and run one and not everybody's the</v>

1113
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 4>type of person who's going to take it to the cards and not everybody has a reach</v>

1114
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:00.060
<v Speaker 4>and speed to jab in and out.</v>

1115
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Luckily we think,</v>

1116
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:00.651
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1117
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:02.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to jab in and out like I'll eat.</v>

1118
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.251
<v Speaker 4>Do it.</v>

1119
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you have the attributes that Ali has?</v>

1120
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 4>He was born with certain attributes and everybody's born with an attribute for</v>

1121
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:08.980
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

1122
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.813
<v Speaker 4>In my opinion,</v>

1123
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 4>everybody got this far because they can fight.</v>

1124
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Nobody got here,</v>

1125
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1126
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Speaker 4>this far without having some innate ability to fight,</v>

1127
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.193
<v Speaker 4>to defend themselves.</v>

1128
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.950
<v Speaker 4>So all our body types can defend themselves,</v>

1129
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:24.650
<v Speaker 4>but you have to discover what works best for that body type.</v>

1130
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Would Tyson is a perfect example.</v>

1131
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.321
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1132
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 4>They thought you couldn't make it in the pools if I'd always going to get killed</v>

1133
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 4>in the pros bright.</v>

1134
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>There's never been a short guy.</v>

1135
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 4>When when Ali was dancing around,</v>

1136
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:33.891
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>

1137
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1138
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.851
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to work.</v>

1139
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 4>He's going to get tired and he goes to the heavyweights heavyweight shouldn't</v>

1140
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 4>bounce around and at least to spar a lot with lightweights,</v>

1141
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 4>he sparse six rounds with light weights,</v>

1142
00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:43.820
<v Speaker 4>then six rounds with a heavyweight.</v>

1143
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1144
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Because he would play tag with a lightweight.</v>

1145
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 5>It just about speed and movement.</v>

1146
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:49.710
<v Speaker 5>You move twice as much with the lightweight.</v>

1147
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.390
<v Speaker 5>What is your thoughts on on hard sparring?</v>

1148
00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 5>Because when you see the ties in the way they spar,</v>

1149
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.273
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>

1150
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 5>there's a great benefit in that.</v>

1151
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.880
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a great benefit in that barely hitting each other shit.</v>

1152
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I do that.</v>

1153
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 5>I do tremendous amount of that.</v>

1154
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1155
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 5>one thing when people spar with me,</v>

1156
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:04.981
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

1157
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:05.191
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1158
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:05.461
<v Speaker 5>you move.</v>

1159
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:06.294
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

1160
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:06.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1161
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:07.201
<v Speaker 5>people are like,</v>

1162
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:08.580
<v Speaker 5>it's so seamless the way you move.</v>

1163
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.540
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1164
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 5>I do thousands of hours of live rolling,</v>

1165
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:12.000
<v Speaker 5>inspiring,</v>

1166
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.020
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of those hours,</v>

1167
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 5>I would say 80% of them is very light because I know the terrain.</v>

1168
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.520
<v Speaker 5>I just want to go through the sequences as many times as I can and when I'm</v>

1169
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:20.941
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

1170
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:21.774
<v Speaker 5>really warmed up,</v>

1171
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.450
<v Speaker 5>then I'll go heart in all start talking smack a bit in the gym and I'm like,</v>

1172
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.771
<v Speaker 5>oh my,</v>

1173
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:26.780
<v Speaker 5>let's see what you got and I'll,</v>

1174
00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

1175
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell the guy when it's time to go really hard and we're having fun with it.</v>

1176
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:30.721
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1177
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:30.991
<v Speaker 5>For me,</v>

1178
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 5>having fun is really,</v>

1179
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.754
<v Speaker 5>really important.</v>

1180
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.710
<v Speaker 5>Now that's training for longevity,</v>

1181
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 5>but if you have a fight,</v>

1182
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.650
<v Speaker 5>I think you need to do six weeks of hard sparring.</v>

1183
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:38.460
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1184
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 5>Because the speed of the fight is very particular.</v>

1185
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 5>We need to get to fight speed,</v>

1186
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.160
<v Speaker 5>the actual speed of the fight because you might get caught sleeping if you,</v>

1187
00:27:47.161 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 5>if you haven't done that now,</v>

1188
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 5>if you have a tremendous amount of fight experience,</v>

1189
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 5>you don't need the less of that.</v>

1190
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:52.981
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1191
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:53.341
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1192
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:55.200
<v Speaker 5>a tie who has been fighting since he's eight years old.</v>

1193
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 5>He can tune up just on the path and go fight.</v>

1194
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 5>Why he's been doing it since the day he can.</v>

1195
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.620
<v Speaker 5>He can walk,</v>

1196
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:01.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1197
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 5>almost like you look at a Mayweather.</v>

1198
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.630
<v Speaker 5>I can get me with already with just a little Mitt work,</v>

1199
00:28:06.631 --> 00:28:07.081
<v Speaker 5>put them in there.</v>

1200
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be at a world champion.</v>

1201
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:08.510
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1202
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.840
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1203
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.020
<v Speaker 5>it's hardwired.</v>

1204
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.850
<v Speaker 5>If you look at a baby's brain,</v>

1205
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.720
<v Speaker 5>the baby's brain is not wrinkled like a heat,</v>

1206
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.700
<v Speaker 5>like an adult's brain.</v>

1207
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 5>It's wrinkled to us of small degree.</v>

1208
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 5>As he goes through his experiences,</v>

1209
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 5>especially in the first three years of his life,</v>

1210
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 5>his brain literally gets hardwired and wrinkled and it gets less and less</v>

1211
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:29.331
<v Speaker 5>wrinkled over time and when you're hardwired to do something you,</v>

1212
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.410
<v Speaker 5>the likelihood of you needing to tune up is,</v>

1213
00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:33.721
<v Speaker 5>it's very,</v>

1214
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:34.351
<v Speaker 5>it's very minimal.</v>

1215
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1216
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.041
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1217
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I remember looking at the biography of me whether,</v>

1218
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 5>and he was saying when he would go to picnics with his family,</v>

1219
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.750
<v Speaker 5>his father would bring boxing gloves and he,</v>

1220
00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 5>his box with his cousins.</v>

1221
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 5>They literally will be punching each other's for him.</v>

1222
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1223
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.970
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1224
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.400
<v Speaker 5>he's been doing it so long.</v>

1225
00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:48.480
<v Speaker 5>The more experienced you are,</v>

1226
00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 5>the less hard sparring you need.</v>

1227
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.010
<v Speaker 5>The more seasoned you are,</v>

1228
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 5>the less hard sparring you need.</v>

1229
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:55.260
<v Speaker 5>You know what fighting is.</v>

1230
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 5>You just need a little tuneup at the end.</v>

1231
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 5>So if you look at Georgia,</v>

1232
00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 5>Georgia,</v>

1233
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.153
<v Speaker 5>great example,</v>

1234
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 5>he's super skilled and he's super healthy.</v>

1235
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.560
<v Speaker 5>Some guys get to the high skill level,</v>

1236
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:05.640
<v Speaker 5>but they're broken up.</v>

1237
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.080
<v Speaker 5>Their body's broken,</v>

1238
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:07.920
<v Speaker 5>their knees broken.</v>

1239
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>They can barely,</v>

1240
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 5>I barely have three,</v>

1241
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 5>four fights left in them,</v>

1242
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1243
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to get really,</v>

1244
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 5>really good and then be broken?</v>

1245
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:13.621
<v Speaker 5>What you,</v>

1246
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 5>when you got there,</v>

1247
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.031
<v Speaker 5>you finally,</v>

1248
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:15.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1249
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 5>you've been cultivating these skills for 15 years.</v>

1250
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:17.874
<v Speaker 5>You get there,</v>

1251
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.940
<v Speaker 5>you get those skills that you want it all.</v>

1252
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:20.521
<v Speaker 5>I can't use them.</v>

1253
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Why am I,</v>

1254
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 5>the machine is broken.</v>

1255
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.101
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1256
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1257
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.383
<v Speaker 5>I'm 38.</v>

1258
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:25.970
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I,</v>

1259
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.803
<v Speaker 5>when I was 20,</v>

1260
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.211
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1261
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 5>personally because I spar 80% of my sparring is very flow and relaxed.</v>

1262
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 5>Like I use a lot of,</v>

1263
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 5>I train a lot with purple belts,</v>

1264
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.681
<v Speaker 5>Bluebell Zinpro belts.</v>

1265
00:29:33.681 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1266
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Because they kind of hurt me if they tried,</v>

1267
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 5>I just toy with them till I'm warmed up,</v>

1268
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:38.761
<v Speaker 5>I'm flowing.</v>

1269
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:39.481
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really working,</v>

1270
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:40.081
<v Speaker 5>harms flowing,</v>

1271
00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:41.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm just doing my combinations.</v>

1272
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

1273
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 4>then when I really want to have a good challenge,</v>

1274
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll take one of the most elite guys,</v>

1275
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 4>one of my pros and I'll do one or two rounds with them.</v>

1276
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:47.621
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1277
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I won't burn my machine out.</v>

1278
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:49.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1279
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 4>like imagine driving your car and the red line all the time.</v>

1280
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Now that's a great way of looking at it.</v>

1282
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

1283
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 4>when you guys get ready for a fight,</v>

1284
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 4>like say if you get George ready for a fight,</v>

1285
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.620
<v Speaker 4>how much time do you spend on working on his recovery from the workouts?</v>

1286
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1287
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 4>like how do you bust out the Tim Tam Machine and ice things down?</v>

1288
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Like how aware of you or are you guys have like do you have,</v>

1289
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 4>I guess a regimented program of how to recover from exercise?</v>

1290
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 4>Recovery is everything.</v>

1291
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:19.831
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

1292
00:30:19.831 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 4>it's stress plus recovery equals adaptation.</v>

1293
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Stress Plus Stress Equals d training and an injury.</v>

1294
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 4>a good trainer,</v>

1296
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.303
<v Speaker 4>a good trainer.</v>

1297
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.080
<v Speaker 4>He understands super compensation rate.</v>

1298
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:32.561
<v Speaker 4>You have stress,</v>

1299
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 4>you have recovery,</v>

1300
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.240
<v Speaker 4>and then you have a new level of skill or ability.</v>

1301
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 4>If you don't go through the recovery phase,</v>

1302
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 4>you will not reap the rewards of your training or has to be a recovery phase.</v>

1303
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Not every athlete has a level of recovery that they can,</v>

1304
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:47.591
<v Speaker 4>they can achieve.</v>

1305
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 4>So as you get,</v>

1306
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 4>as you get more experience as an athlete,</v>

1307
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.280
<v Speaker 4>your body can can,</v>

1308
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 4>as you become,</v>

1309
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1310
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 4>as you're,</v>

1311
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 4>as you're more and more fit,</v>

1312
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.103
<v Speaker 4>I should say,</v>

1313
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 4>your body can recover for more stress.</v>

1314
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 4>So I have to gauge how good mice my student is.</v>

1315
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 4>It has to be challenging but manageable.</v>

1316
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 4>If I make it too challenging,</v>

1317
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.921
<v Speaker 4>I'm red lining him.</v>

1318
00:31:05.921 --> 00:31:06.754
<v Speaker 4>He's going to break,</v>

1319
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.110
<v Speaker 4>he's and he's going to pop.</v>

1320
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be unmotivated.</v>

1321
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 4>If it's too easy,</v>

1322
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:11.884
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be bored.</v>

1323
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 4>I have to find the right amount of stimulus.</v>

1324
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 4>So when I'm in the practice room,</v>

1325
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 4>if I see Georgia just mauling guys and destroying them,</v>

1326
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.903
<v Speaker 4>I have to make it,</v>

1327
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.890
<v Speaker 4>I have to scale the workout so that it's harder,</v>

1328
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.940
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to scale it so high is that I injure him and break him or that</v>

1329
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:28.720
<v Speaker 4>he made out of practice by a hair and now he's not motivated to do another camp.</v>

1330
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:29.771
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1331
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:29.971
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1332
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 4>we reached those high intensity levels periodically throughout the year and they</v>

1333
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 4>have to be done in a certain way that it's fun.</v>

1334
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.181
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

1335
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:38.014
<v Speaker 4>George was like,</v>

1336
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 4>he was on your show and he was saying,</v>

1337
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to kill them in the practice room</v>

1338
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1339
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.031
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1340
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 4>He's right.</v>

1341
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 4>But I do it so rarely.</v>

1342
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.520
<v Speaker 4>I do so periodically and I make it a joke.</v>

1343
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.130
<v Speaker 4>That's why like what he was trying to say is that I brought in the guys in the</v>

1344
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 4>room and I was watching him spar with Georgia.</v>

1345
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to touch his face.</v>

1346
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 4>This is when he was like a mega star,</v>

1347
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 4>like he was the champion.</v>

1348
00:31:56.891 --> 00:31:58.570
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to try to double leg him.</v>

1349
00:31:58.571 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to try to hurt him because they're like,</v>

1350
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to come here in his house and tried to show him.</v>

1351
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a respect thing.</v>

1352
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:06.190
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1353
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.521
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1354
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:07.480
<v Speaker 4>there's starstruck,</v>

1355
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:07.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1356
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 4>these young kids salad,</v>

1357
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:09.964
<v Speaker 4>bring them in.</v>

1358
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.361
<v Speaker 4>And I'd be like,</v>

1359
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.194
<v Speaker 4>listen guys,</v>

1360
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>I'll give a speech.</v>

1361
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 4>The first guy to double leg,</v>

1362
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm the first guy to put 'em out.</v>

1363
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.040
<v Speaker 4>I would put like a $5,000 reward,</v>

1364
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1365
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.260
<v Speaker 4>I think knock him out and the hurt,</v>

1366
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:21.041
<v Speaker 4>if you've knocked George,</v>

1367
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you 5,000 bucks.</v>

1368
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.130
<v Speaker 4>And she leaves for George on his back.</v>

1369
00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:25.300
<v Speaker 4>If you put George on his back,</v>

1370
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.501
<v Speaker 4>if you take them down,</v>

1371
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 4>put them on his back,</v>

1372
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 4>I'll stop the whole practice and praise you for 20 minutes in front of everybody</v>

1373
00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 4>in the gym.</v>

1374
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1375
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:31.610
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1376
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.811
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1377
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 4>and students don't get praised by me very often.</v>

1378
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 4>So George would be like,</v>

1379
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.603
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1380
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>

1381
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.871
<v Speaker 4>they're coming after me.</v>

1382
00:32:37.871 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 4>And he would get riled up.</v>

1383
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 4>And I will do this periodically.</v>

1384
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:40.251
<v Speaker 4>Rarely,</v>

1385
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:40.461
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1386
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:40.591
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1387
00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:40.741
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1388
00:32:40.741 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about world class,</v>

1389
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 4>world title fight,</v>

1390
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:43.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1391
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:43.964
<v Speaker 4>the stuff's on the line.</v>

1392
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 4>And I need these guys to actually show me where is missing something because</v>

1393
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 4>then when you have this perfect practice and you win all the time,</v>

1394
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.731
<v Speaker 4>what do you work on?</v>

1395
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:53.091
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1396
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:53.924
<v Speaker 4>nothing went wrong.</v>

1397
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.950
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing to fix.</v>

1398
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.791
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

1399
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 4>there are times where we really red light.</v>

1400
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever had anybody knock him out and practice and take that money?</v>

1401
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 4>Now he's been dropped once in practice pretty badly.</v>

1402
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.790
<v Speaker 4>And it's a funny story,</v>

1403
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 4>but the money wasn't on the line that time.</v>

1404
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 4>There was no price for that.</v>

1405
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.830
<v Speaker 4>One time he got dropped in practice and um,</v>

1406
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I want it to stop.</v>

1407
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:16.850
<v Speaker 4>I want to pull the plug.</v>

1408
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.560
<v Speaker 4>It was for a world title fight.</v>

1409
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:20.690
<v Speaker 4>He was fighting that hardy two weeks before his fight.</v>

1410
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:22.940
<v Speaker 4>I was sure he was concussed.</v>

1411
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.021
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1412
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:24.231
<v Speaker 4>George,</v>

1413
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:25.064
<v Speaker 4>I'm pulling the,</v>

1414
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:25.560
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1415
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 4>the round one more round.</v>

1416
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.620
<v Speaker 4>He said to me,</v>

1417
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.010
<v Speaker 4>coach,</v>

1418
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.761
<v Speaker 4>let me finish the round.</v>

1419
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay.</v>

1420
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Let me finish the next round.</v>

1421
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 4>And I felt that if I pulled him,</v>

1422
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I would have killed his confidence.</v>

1423
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I would have killed his confidence.</v>

1424
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:36.801
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

1425
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:37.431
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

1426
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1427
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 4>you could do the next round.</v>

1428
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.551
<v Speaker 4>And I told the other guy,</v>

1429
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 4>he was sparring with Dolan line a single glove.</v>

1430
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Like I whispered to him,</v>

1431
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 4>not a single glove on it,</v>

1432
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.530
<v Speaker 4>just take a mauling and George went in the next round not knowing that the other</v>

1433
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:49.640
<v Speaker 4>guy is not allowed to hit him at all.</v>

1434
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 4>He just crushes the guy.</v>

1435
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:52.881
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1436
00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 4>He's just like mauls him and gets that and I was really,</v>

1437
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:56.090
<v Speaker 4>really grateful for that.</v>

1438
00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:56.421
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>

1439
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.570
<v Speaker 4>that guy was a pro and it was very,</v>

1440
00:33:57.571 --> 00:34:02.120
<v Speaker 4>very grateful that he took the beating that we asked them to write and I'm</v>

1441
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 4>joined.</v>

1442
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.441
<v Speaker 4>You have to was like,</v>

1443
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:03.711
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:04.191

1446
00:34:06.861 --> 00:34:07.401

1457
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 4>it was just a fluke.</v>

1458
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:16.881

<v Speaker 4>It's like wow.</v>

1473
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:26.640
<v Speaker 4>He was shocked.</v>

1474
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:26.981
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

1475
00:34:26.981 --> 00:34:27.560

1476
00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:27.741
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1477
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:27.891
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1478
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1479
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.601
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1480
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 4>the UFC was there filming</v>

1481
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.031
<v Speaker 4>so I had to like,</v>

1482
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:32.421
<v Speaker 4>look guys,</v>

1483
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 4>that footage can never air,</v>

1484
00:34:33.501 --> 00:34:33.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1485
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 4>that foot has got to disappear.</v>

1486
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:35.451
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1487
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:35.691
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1488
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:35.871
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1489
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:36.321
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

1490
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1491
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.840
<v Speaker 4>we understand the fights on the line.</v>

1492
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 4>He was fighting Darren hardy two weeks later.</v>

1493
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 4>That's why that fight,</v>

1494
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 4>he was doing a lot of wrestling cause we didn't want to like even chance.</v>

1495
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 4>I was sure he had a concussion when he went in that fight.</v>

1496
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Now pulling the plug on that fight on a lot of people would be like,</v>

1497
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:48.891
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1498
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 4>you put his leg,</v>

1499
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 4>you put his health on the line.</v>

1500
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1501
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.590
<v Speaker 4>But it's so much pressure.</v>

1502
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:52.911
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1503
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 4>George didn't want,</v>

1504
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 4>that has nothing to do with UFC.</v>

1505
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:55.580
<v Speaker 4>We kept it from UFC.</v>

1506
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.721
<v Speaker 4>Like we told them,</v>

1507
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:56.870
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1508
00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:57.651
<v Speaker 4>we told the camera guys,</v>

1509
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Barry this like,</v>

1510
00:34:59.091 --> 00:34:59.920
<v Speaker 4>don't report it.</v>

1511
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Like George would never want to,</v>

1512
00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:02.723
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1513
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.891
<v Speaker 4>back out of that fight.</v>

1514
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:04.701
<v Speaker 4>It was two weeks from now.</v>

1515
00:35:04.701 --> 00:35:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's coming to watch us fight like this despite,</v>

1516
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1517
00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 4>it's been,</v>

1518
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 4>it's been on the,</v>

1519
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.793
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1520
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.360
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it?</v>

1521
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.030
<v Speaker 4>The prime time.</v>

1522
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 4>It's been like three weeks.</v>

1523
00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:12.441
<v Speaker 4>They're filming,</v>

1524
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:12.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1525
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 4>like this is happening,</v>

1526
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 4>this fight is happening no matter what.</v>

1527
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:15.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1528
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 4>the Georges in that mindset.</v>

1529
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1530
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 4>but he went in there honestly like,</v>

1531
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1532
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.641
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1533
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:20.870
<v Speaker 4>after he got dropped pretty badly.</v>

1534
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1535
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1536
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.000
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

1537
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1538
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Forrest Griffin got knocked out twice before his fight with Anderson Silva man</v>

1539
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:28.603
<v Speaker 4>twice.</v>

1540
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.370
<v Speaker 4>And apparently one of them was real bad.</v>

1541
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1542
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1543
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1544
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:33.991
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous.</v>

1545
00:35:33.991 --> 00:35:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I think he was sparring with Vandelay and uh,</v>

1546
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 4>apparently you don't spar with Vandelay?</v>

1547
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.930
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1548
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just fights.</v>

1549
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's old school shooter box,</v>

1551
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 2>especially back then.</v>

1552
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1553
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.331
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1554
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Forest won't really talk about too much cause he,</v>

1555
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1556
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.490
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want it doesn't want it to be perceived as an excuse,</v>

1557
00:35:50.491 --> 00:35:52.210
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1558
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1559
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1560
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 2>how many times have fighters done that?</v>

1561
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:54.901
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

1562
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 2>many factors has done that.</v>

1563
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Countless.</v>

1564
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1565
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.610
<v Speaker 2>To the point where like I just let the fighter,</v>

1566
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:00.300
<v Speaker 2>the site now,</v>

1567
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>unless I really feel like it's urgent,</v>

1568
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 2>which is rare that I've actually had to intervene because at the end of the day,</v>

1569
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 2>when are you 100% it's really rarely happens.</v>

1570
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:09.474
<v Speaker 2>There's always something.</v>

1571
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1572
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.610
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about getting knocked out is that if you get knocked out two weeks</v>

1573
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:15.330
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1574
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 2>your odds of getting knocked out or significantly higher.</v>

1575
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.953
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1576
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.381
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1577
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:19.591
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1578
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:19.831
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1579
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:20.301
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1580
00:36:20.301 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1581
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

1582
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 2>And then Hardy's a really good strike.</v>

1583
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1584
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:24.031
<v Speaker 2>That left hook.</v>

1585
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 2>If it would have touched George,</v>

1586
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 2>George will would have been out like a light.</v>

1587
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.960
<v Speaker 2>He's got a crazy left hook.</v>

1588
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Plus George was hurt two weeks before.</v>

1589
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:30.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1590
00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Thank God it worked out well.</v>

1591
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1592
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:32.791
<v Speaker 2>It worked out.</v>

1593
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.624
<v Speaker 2>Credit.</v>

1594
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1595
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:39.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a balancing act of being a trainer is not something that I envy.</v>

1596
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1597
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.823
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>

1598
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It's tough because I care for these guys,</v>

1599
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:42.790
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

1600
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1601
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 2>They had nothing to do with the business where the money,</v>

1602
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:45.594
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't care less.</v>

1603
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I could not care less.</v>

1604
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 2>But I know that that guy,</v>

1605
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 2>he's on a one way track.</v>

1606
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm telling him no,</v>

1607
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>hit the brakes and he's saying we're going that that break and harmony is gonna</v>

1608
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 2>create a friction and create a doubt in the fighter.</v>

1609
00:36:59.320 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1610
00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Know you,</v>

1611
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.600
<v Speaker 2>are you all in?</v>

1612
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.673
<v Speaker 2>Are you all in?</v>

1613
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.011
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1614
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:03.240
<v Speaker 2>because if you're not all in,</v>

1615
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you're going to scare your fighter.</v>

1616
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1617
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1618
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.420
<v Speaker 2>there's that to consider as well.</v>

1619
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1620
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1621
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.000
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the crop of up and coming talent,</v>

1622
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is such a crazy time for MMA.</v>

1623
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I think when you look at these new guys,</v>

1624
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 2>like Zack beat is one of my favorite guys to watch cause he's,</v>

1625
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.590
<v Speaker 2>there's these new crop of guys that can do everything and they're,</v>

1626
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:26.850
<v Speaker 2>they're so high level.</v>

1627
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:27.930
<v Speaker 2>By the time you see them,</v>

1628
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 2>like the first fight I saw of the beat inside the octagon.</v>

1629
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:32.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1630
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him on video before,</v>

1631
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.100
<v Speaker 2>but seeing him live you like,</v>

1632
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.500
<v Speaker 2>oh Lee Shit,</v>

1633
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing,</v>

1634
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but he's not just amazing.</v>

1635
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is,</v>

1636
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 2>this is this next level.</v>

1637
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Like there's another level,</v>

1638
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:45.144
<v Speaker 2>like we've seen this,</v>

1639
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 2>these elite fighters and everyone's great at Jujitsu.</v>

1640
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got great takedown defense,</v>

1641
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows how to strike,</v>

1642
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 2>but then you're seeing this new flavor,</v>

1643
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>there's like this,</v>

1644
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1645
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:57.690
<v Speaker 2>the frequencies now higher,</v>

1646
00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 2>and it just seems to me that it every year or so there's these new guys that</v>

1647
00:38:02.371 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 2>jump through and you're going,</v>

1648
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.111
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1649
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:06.720
<v Speaker 2>well now the frequencies quite a bit higher than it was before.</v>

1650
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 2>It's seamless.</v>

1651
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Transitions are more and more seamless,</v>

1652
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.303
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing.</v>

1653
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you're saying,</v>

1654
00:38:12.331 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Speaker 2>they're processing it faster.</v>

1655
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1656
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.520
<v Speaker 2>As they're doing the takedown,</v>

1657
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 2>like Demetrius is flowing into an arm bar to take down his even finished and</v>

1658
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:20.071
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1659
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:23.060
<v Speaker 2>the next generation is watching that and they've adopted that now,</v>

1660
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.990
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to flow into a transition into an art.</v>

1661
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1662
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it's getting,</v>

1663
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it's getting more and more seamless.</v>

1664
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:29.933
<v Speaker 2>They're computers or,</v>

1665
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.290
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1666
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 2>or computing faster and faster information.</v>

1667
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 2>They're thinking what they're going to do on the ground.</v>

1668
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:35.801
<v Speaker 2>It hits the ground.</v>

1669
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:35.901
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1670
00:38:35.901 --> 00:38:36.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1671
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1672
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.190
<v Speaker 5>it is incredible</v>

1673
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.680
<v Speaker 2>and they know what can be done now.</v>

1674
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.180
<v Speaker 2>They've seen it all possibilities.</v>

1675
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.690
<v Speaker 2>So they have this database in their mind of accomplishments that have already</v>

1676
00:38:44.691 --> 00:38:46.070
<v Speaker 2>been achieved in other fighters.</v>

1677
00:38:46.071 --> 00:38:46.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1678
00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:47.124
<v Speaker 2>He's been awakened.</v>

1679
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1680
00:38:47.781 --> 00:38:49.070
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy,</v>

1681
00:38:49.071 --> 00:38:49.700
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1682
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.330
<v Speaker 2>When you stop and think about when you first got involved in the sport and then</v>

1683
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:55.160
<v Speaker 2>look at the level to fighters are at now,</v>

1684
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:59.360
<v Speaker 2>there's not really a commensurate sport in terms of like modern mainstream</v>

1685
00:38:59.361 --> 00:39:00.170
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

1686
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Where you've people have achieved is such an incredibly high level of</v>

1687
00:39:04.371 --> 00:39:08.690
<v Speaker 2>proficiency that's so far exceeds where it was a decade ago or two decades ago.</v>

1688
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.430
<v Speaker 2>There's really no comparison.</v>

1689
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.900
<v Speaker 2>The growth rate is ridiculous.</v>

1690
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>

1691
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.700
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's a</v>

1692
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.870
<v Speaker 2>a coincidence that the growth rate in this sport is incredible and this is the</v>

1693
00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:24.620
<v Speaker 2>sport that has the most amount of variables in terms of combat sports,</v>

1694
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of variables in terms of what,</v>

1695
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:27.410
<v Speaker 2>what a fighter can do to you.</v>

1696
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:31.910
<v Speaker 5>There are more ways to win than any other combat sport,</v>

1697
00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:32.360
<v Speaker 5>obviously.</v>

1698
00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1699
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.250
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I find it.</v>

1700
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:35.150
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1701
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.590
<v Speaker 5>the more you limit us an athlete,</v>

1702
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.940
<v Speaker 5>the more it's about torque.</v>

1703
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.021
<v Speaker 5>So for instance,</v>

1704
00:39:39.021 --> 00:39:39.854
<v Speaker 5>if you look at sprinting,</v>

1705
00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:44.210
<v Speaker 5>if I were to race Hussein bolt and it had all the best trainers,</v>

1706
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.600
<v Speaker 5>the best sprint coaches and Hussein bolt had the most mediocre,</v>

1707
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:51.920
<v Speaker 5>mediocre sprint coaches and we raced when we were both 20 years old in our</v>

1708
00:39:51.921 --> 00:39:52.754
<v Speaker 5>prime.</v>

1709
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to win you?</v>

1710
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.190
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate the that</v>

1711
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.580
<v Speaker 5>the competence.</v>

1712
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.630
<v Speaker 5>It's a joke question,</v>

1713
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1714
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.130
<v Speaker 5>He's going to win for sure.</v>

1715
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.353
<v Speaker 5>Put us in MMA.</v>

1716
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.621
<v Speaker 5>We're the same way.</v>

1717
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:05.891
<v Speaker 5>Class,</v>

1718
00:40:05.891 --> 00:40:06.281
<v Speaker 5>same height,</v>

1719
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:07.060
<v Speaker 5>everything's the same.</v>

1720
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:07.841
<v Speaker 5>I have the best coaches.</v>

1721
00:40:07.841 --> 00:40:08.740
<v Speaker 5>He has the worst coaches.</v>

1722
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Who's going to win?</v>

1723
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.030
<v Speaker 5>You're going to fuck them.</v>

1724
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to kill him because coaching now is has a greater influence.</v>

1725
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.790
<v Speaker 5>Sprinter.</v>

1726
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Say Sprint coaches say we can make you faster.</v>

1727
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 5>We can not make you fast.</v>

1728
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.770
<v Speaker 5>You have to be born fast.</v>

1729
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 5>That we could shave off a few milliseconds.</v>

1730
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1731
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.630
<v Speaker 5>In MMA we can make you,</v>

1732
00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I could take a regular Joe and get them all the way up to UFC.</v>

1733
00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.260
<v Speaker 5>I can't make him UFC champion.</v>

1734
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.720
<v Speaker 5>I won't say I can make them UFC champion to be UFC champion.</v>

1735
00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:33.560
<v Speaker 5>You need a talent.</v>

1736
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.391
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1737
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:34.671
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1738
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:35.030
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1739
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 5>there's a talent there to be in the 1% but to get you to UFC because there are</v>

1740
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:41.330
<v Speaker 5>so many possibilities.</v>

1741
00:40:41.331 --> 00:40:43.910
<v Speaker 5>There are so many ways to trick your opponent are so many ways to turn the</v>

1742
00:40:43.911 --> 00:40:44.744
<v Speaker 5>tables on him.</v>

1743
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.890
<v Speaker 5>The torque no longer matters or torque is less significant.</v>

1744
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.580
<v Speaker 5>So if we're talking about football where I'm only a lot to do these certain</v>

1745
00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:54.890
<v Speaker 5>maneuvers trickeries put to the side,</v>

1746
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.000
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to trick me.</v>

1747
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.450
<v Speaker 5>But in MMA you're alleged to trick me any which way you want.</v>

1748
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.800
<v Speaker 5>There are very few little rules,</v>

1749
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:01.933
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1750
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.290
<v Speaker 5>But outside of these,</v>

1751
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.280
<v Speaker 5>these uh,</v>

1752
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.720
<v Speaker 5>bard rules is Barton maneuvers.</v>

1753
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.400
<v Speaker 5>You can trick me any which way you want.</v>

1754
00:41:07.401 --> 00:41:09.770
<v Speaker 5>So what happens is you take your opponent to amaze you,</v>

1755
00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:12.710
<v Speaker 5>take your opponent into a world where torque does it matter so much.</v>

1756
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.600
<v Speaker 5>And that's why the more restrictive,</v>

1757
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1758
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:15.501
<v Speaker 5>a sport is,</v>

1759
00:41:15.501 --> 00:41:16.101
<v Speaker 5>let's say for instance,</v>

1760
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:16.934
<v Speaker 5>boxing.</v>

1761
00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Boxing is more restrictive than Moitai.</v>

1762
00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.570
<v Speaker 5>So the guys with Torque,</v>

1763
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.950
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do better in boxing.</v>

1764
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.950
<v Speaker 5>Then they will necessarily end Moitai cause in what I can use more trickery.</v>

1765
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.610
<v Speaker 5>I can be a little dweeb and just beat you with clinching.</v>

1766
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Or I could beat you with a trick kick or I could beat you with a back.</v>

1767
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.470
<v Speaker 5>A back.</v>

1768
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:32.540
<v Speaker 5>La Friends is a back kick.</v>

1769
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can generate knockout power with a backache.</v>

1770
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.781
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1771
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 5>with a Red Cross or left hook,</v>

1772
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 5>not everybody's going to have that bone crushing power.</v>

1773
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.191
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1774
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 5>if you teach somebody how to throw a proper backache,</v>

1775
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:42.261
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>

1776
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 5>cause you've got the best back in the game,</v>

1777
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 5>you could teach a regular Joel in a few years how did generate knockout power?</v>

1778
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.150
<v Speaker 5>So now he,</v>

1779
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 5>he has that element on the table.</v>

1780
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 5>So because MMA soul,</v>

1781
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:55.523
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1782
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:56.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1783
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1784
00:41:56.731 --> 00:42:01.420
<v Speaker 5>there's so few rules we have a greater environment for the intellect to,</v>

1785
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.740
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1786
00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.573
<v Speaker 5>to shine.</v>

1787
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:03.643
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1788
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:07.030
<v Speaker 2>You said something wants to one of your fighters in between rounds and they</v>

1789
00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:07.721
<v Speaker 2>really stood out.</v>

1790
00:42:07.721 --> 00:42:08.081
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

1791
00:42:08.081 --> 00:42:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I want you to overwhelm his mind with possibilities like your,</v>

1792
00:42:12.521 --> 00:42:12.731
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1793
00:42:12.731 --> 00:42:14.200
<v Speaker 2>your overwhelming him.</v>

1794
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.380
<v Speaker 2>You're making him think about all the potential variables that are coming his</v>

1795
00:42:17.381 --> 00:42:17.650
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1796
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1797
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 2>My Dad has a great way to put it.</v>

1798
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.340
<v Speaker 2>We talk about</v>

1799
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:20.631
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1800
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:21.464
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1801
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.433
<v Speaker 5>a variety.</v>

1802
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.690
<v Speaker 5>So everybody's looking for a pattern.</v>

1803
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.731
<v Speaker 5>If I do Jab,</v>

1804
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:25.941
<v Speaker 5>Jab,</v>

1805
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:26.774
<v Speaker 5>cross,</v>

1806
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 5>and I do with before times,</v>

1807
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.870
<v Speaker 5>the fourth time you're going to see it.</v>

1808
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be slower to you.</v>

1809
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1810
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Because your body's going to your brain is,</v>

1811
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 5>is that again,</v>

1812
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.211
<v Speaker 5>this is all hypothetical.</v>

1813
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 5>This is just my personal experience.</v>

1814
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm basing this on my own personal experience.</v>

1815
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.130
<v Speaker 5>When somebody does something to me a second or third time it,</v>

1816
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I see it personally.</v>

1817
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm perceiving it slower and I have a window to counter you.</v>

1818
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.691
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1819
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:48.640
<v Speaker 5>when I spar with George,</v>

1820
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.720
<v Speaker 5>George is a tricky as guy.</v>

1821
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.563
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you why,</v>

1822
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:51.430
<v Speaker 5>because he's,</v>

1823
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.610
<v Speaker 5>he has so many tricks.</v>

1824
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1825
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 5>So many attacks that he rarely,</v>

1826
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.210
<v Speaker 5>rarely ever shows you the same trick twice.</v>

1827
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.490
<v Speaker 5>And he's the master at adapting.</v>

1828
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.900
<v Speaker 5>So if you do a trick on him once and you try it again,</v>

1829
00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:04.734
<v Speaker 5>he's going to shut you down.</v>

1830
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.240
<v Speaker 5>So look at all his rematches.</v>

1831
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.500
<v Speaker 5>When you read Bj Penn,</v>

1832
00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:07.731
<v Speaker 5>when you were,</v>

1833
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.220
<v Speaker 5>you matched Matt.</v>

1834
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:08.850
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

1835
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:09.661
<v Speaker 5>every time they read much,</v>

1836
00:43:09.661 --> 00:43:10.590
<v Speaker 5>it was progressively worse.</v>

1837
00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:12.300
<v Speaker 5>The third time you fought my heels was even easier.</v>

1838
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.610
<v Speaker 5>Don't try the same trick on George twice.</v>

1839
00:43:14.611 --> 00:43:15.444
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get crushed.</v>

1840
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.800
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's why meal as a,</v>

1841
00:43:16.801 --> 00:43:17.401
<v Speaker 5>as a martial arts,</v>

1842
00:43:17.401 --> 00:43:21.450
<v Speaker 5>I developed like a lot of variety of skill because every week I'd have to come</v>

1843
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:23.580
<v Speaker 5>up with a new trick or as George is going to shut that down.</v>

1844
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.040
<v Speaker 5>After 10 years I've been started becoming like a trickster.</v>

1845
00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:26.251
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1846
00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:29.610
<v Speaker 5>what other magic trick can I get away with one time because next week I need a</v>

1847
00:43:29.611 --> 00:43:31.200
<v Speaker 5>new trick because it won't work on him again.</v>

1848
00:43:31.201 --> 00:43:31.530
<v Speaker 5>He's eating,</v>

1849
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.430
<v Speaker 5>he's going to get wise to it.</v>

1850
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.650
<v Speaker 5>He's a master at add.</v>

1851
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.890
<v Speaker 5>It might work once on him.</v>

1852
00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:37.350
<v Speaker 5>The second time you're going to get shut down.</v>

1853
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.770
<v Speaker 5>Well I feel like that</v>

1854
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 2>was a factor in Dominick Cruz losing to Cody Garbrandt.</v>

1855
00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:43.911
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1856
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Cause those Alpha male guys had seen that check so many times.</v>

1857
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1858
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.523
<v Speaker 2>We can like,</v>

1859
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 2>apparently Justin Buchholz can imitate Dominick Cruz in training like that weird</v>

1860
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Herky jerky movement with the hands down.</v>

1861
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:56.991
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1862
00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird one,</v>

1863
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:58.131
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1864
00:43:58.131 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the weird at all the fighters I've ever watched fight.</v>

1865
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Dominic might be the weirdest.</v>

1866
00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:03.260
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1867
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:03.741
<v Speaker 2>Cause you,</v>

1868
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 2>you look at him and he's,</v>

1869
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.953
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1870
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.153
<v Speaker 2>he's such a,</v>

1871
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.240
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

1872
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Very smart guy.</v>

1873
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.460
<v Speaker 2>But he's crazy and a weird way.</v>

1874
00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the things that he said is like,</v>

1875
00:44:12.671 --> 00:44:12.861
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

1876
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not very flexible.</v>

1877
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you,</v>

1878
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 2>why are you even saying that?</v>

1879
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:17.841
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1880
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't even make any sense to me.</v>

1881
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Like why not get more flexible?</v>

1882
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:22.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1883
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 2>it's not like saying like,</v>

1884
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:23.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1885
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:24.211
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1886
00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm too short.</v>

1887
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't grow so you're fucked.</v>

1888
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>You know you're never gonna to play basketball saying I'm not flexible enough.</v>

1889
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like easy fix.</v>

1890
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the dumbest thing to ever say.</v>

1891
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's so,</v>

1892
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 2>it's so much more dumb than I'm not strong enough.</v>

1893
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.811
<v Speaker 2>We will,</v>

1894
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>if you gain weight from muscle,</v>

1895
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you might not be in that weight class anymore.</v>

1896
00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 2>You've got a real problem there,</v>

1897
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not flexible and if you got zero problem,</v>

1898
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you just have to stretch.</v>

1899
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 2>But he doesn't stretch.</v>

1900
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.411
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1901
00:44:50.411 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about Jujitsu techniques,</v>

1902
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1903
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:52.981
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1904
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't play that hard guard guard,</v>

1905
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 2>high guard shit.</v>

1906
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any flexibility.</v>

1907
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1908
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying like that doesn't make any sense and like head kicks and</v>

1909
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.271
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1910
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 2>He's like very stiff in his legs with throwing kicks and like that's,</v>

1911
00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 2>that's an easy fix.</v>

1912
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy fix.</v>

1913
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you fix that?</v>

1914
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.213
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

1915
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:12.240
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1916
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.240
<v Speaker 2>but also the mindset of a champion in this same guy who just just,</v>

1917
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

1918
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.893
<v Speaker 2>I'm not flexible.</v>

1919
00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't even understand how those things live together.</v>

1920
00:45:24.961 --> 00:45:27.200
<v Speaker 2>In the same mind if I was treating him,</v>

1921
00:45:27.201 --> 00:45:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I would make him head kick.</v>

1922
00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I would insist on.</v>

1923
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.010
<v Speaker 2>All of these have to be there cause he doesn't knock guys out with his hands.</v>

1924
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:32.221
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>

1925
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:35.130
<v Speaker 2>the head kick has to always be a possibility always in Tibet and then you will</v>

1926
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 2>knock out guys with your hands because they'll have their high guard up because</v>

1927
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:39.960
<v Speaker 2>they don't want that kick.</v>

1928
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:40.801
<v Speaker 2>And then upper cut,</v>

1929
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:41.071
<v Speaker 2>we'll come.</v>

1930
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.550
<v Speaker 2>The body shot will come to the back of the cook.</v>

1931
00:45:42.551 --> 00:45:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll make it back for sure.</v>

1932
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if you don't have power in your hands,</v>

1933
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you need to backache.</v>

1934
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 2>You need to head kick.</v>

1935
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Those are two weapons that can always knock a guy out so you don't back.</v>

1936
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Your feudal hecky can never score knockouts.</v>

1937
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:52.943
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1938
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:53.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1939
00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point man.</v>

1940
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

1941
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 2>when did you see this Stephen Thompson thing with Darren toe where he wants them</v>

1942
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 2>to outlaw that side kick to the knee?</v>

1943
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1944
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that.</v>

1945
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently his knee got really fucked up in the Darren till fight.</v>

1946
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:06.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1947
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:06.730
<v Speaker 2>what do,</v>

1948
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.900
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that side kick to the knee that everyone's do not even</v>

1949
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:10.591
<v Speaker 2>the oblique kick.</v>

1950
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Just a front leg side kick to the knee the same way you're,</v>

1951
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:16.380
<v Speaker 2>well Romero used it on Robert Whitaker fucked up his knee and the first fight</v>

1952
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 2>and then winter could use it on Romero.</v>

1953
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Like right away he was stuck in fight.</v>

1954
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful to fuck up his knee.</v>

1955
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1956
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a legitimate kick.</v>

1957
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1958
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.320
<v Speaker 2>it's a legitimate 100% kick it,</v>

1959
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 2>it allows the smaller,</v>

1960
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:30.240
<v Speaker 2>weaker guide to hurt the bigger,</v>

1961
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:31.074
<v Speaker 2>stronger guy.</v>

1962
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:31.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1963
00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 2>in the case of Darren till it allows the bigger,</v>

1964
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.040
<v Speaker 2>stronger guy hurt the other big stronger if it works for the smaller guy who</v>

1965
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 2>works for the bigger guy.</v>

1966
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1967
00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:38.610
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1968
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 2>It's just a legit,</v>

1969
00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1970
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.831
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>

1971
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a legit technique you have to prepare for.</v>

1972
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1973
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.501
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1974
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:47.280
<v Speaker 2>You're studying in a way that you see when somebody's standing sideways,</v>

1975
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 2>they're harder to punch,</v>

1976
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 2>they're easier to kick.</v>

1977
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:51.961
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying,</v>

1978
00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:52.171
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1979
00:46:52.171 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 2>I want to stand in this way where I'm harder to budge,</v>

1980
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want you to kick me.</v>

1981
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>So if I stand square,</v>

1982
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm more susceptible to back kick more sub two punches,</v>

1983
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:04.170
<v Speaker 2>but less sub susceptible to leg kicks or the oblique kick or the psychic to the</v>

1984
00:47:04.171 --> 00:47:05.004
<v Speaker 2>knee or whatnot.</v>

1985
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying to you,</v>

1986
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:10.260
<v Speaker 2>don't punch me cause I'm more vulnerable this way.</v>

1987
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So whatever your vulnerability is,</v>

1988
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you chose that vulnerability by standing sideways.</v>

1989
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Why don't the Thai stand sideways?</v>

1990
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Because they know they're going to get chopped to the leg,</v>

1991
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:18.541
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1992
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:19.860
<v Speaker 2>They're always fighting good kickers.</v>

1993
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 2>They're always fighting amazing kickers.</v>

1994
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:22.974
<v Speaker 2>When you go to Thailand,</v>

1995
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 2>that guy may be a good puncher but he's for sure a great kicker.</v>

1996
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going to run into a guy who doesn't know how to kick.</v>

1997
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 2>They all know how to kick knee and elbow and some of them know how to punch</v>

1998
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:32.381
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1999
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 2>really well also.</v>

2000
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.870
<v Speaker 2>So they stand in away.</v>

2001
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Moitai has developed in a way is very anti kick Antony anti elbow and it's not</v>

2002
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:42.850
<v Speaker 2>as defensive to the punches.</v>

2003
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.170
<v Speaker 2>So if I want to stand,</v>

2004
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>if I want to avoid punches,</v>

2005
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll stand more.</v>

2006
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Bladed lets him and fighting it like a Bj Penn was very heavy handed and more of</v>

2007
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:49.241
<v Speaker 2>a puncher.</v>

2008
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:50.074
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't kick much.</v>

2009
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm going to stand bladed like you see what George would made him drop one</v>

2010
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:53.584
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

2011
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.071
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2012
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.600
<v Speaker 2>So he can use his jab from,</v>

2013
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 2>from down to up.</v>

2014
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:56.941
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2015
00:47:56.941 --> 00:47:57.774
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's faster,</v>

2016
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.040
<v Speaker 2>has a greater reach and it's harder to counter.</v>

2017
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you would've stood more square and Moitai would have been useless</v>

2018
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 2>because Bj doesn't kick,</v>

2019
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but then you'd be more open to punches.</v>

2020
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 2>So the way you're standing,</v>

2021
00:48:09.161 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 2>the way one of the boys standing that the antagonist to that,</v>

2022
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 2>that the antidote to that is that a kick?</v>

2023
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.480
<v Speaker 2>So how could you stand that way?</v>

2024
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Just swished away.</v>

2025
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You're stunning and now it,</v>

2026
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:18.641
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2027
00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 2>now you're more open to punches.</v>

2028
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:20.951
<v Speaker 2>But that's adaptation.</v>

2029
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:21.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what fighting is about.</v>

2030
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2031
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.721
<v Speaker 2>It's rock,</v>

2032
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:22.991
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

2033
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:23.350
<v Speaker 2>scissors.</v>

2034
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:24.210
<v Speaker 2>If I use rock,</v>

2035
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2036
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't outlaw paper.</v>

2037
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:26.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't say everybody.</v>

2038
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:26.571
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2039
00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 2>nobody is allowed to use paper.</v>

2040
00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:28.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2041
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's the antidote to what you're doing.</v>

2042
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2043
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.510
<v Speaker 2>And when the ties fight,</v>

2044
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:35.230
<v Speaker 2>they have that very light front leg which would prevent that front leg side kick</v>

2045
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 2>to the knee.</v>

2046
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2047
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Cause they're always like very light.</v>

2048
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>So if you kicked their knee there,</v>

2049
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to go backwards to stand.</v>

2050
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:42.640
<v Speaker 2>That way they're standing that we had a cost,</v>

2051
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.010
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2052
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Punches and also the cost.</v>

2053
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the ability to use that movement,</v>

2054
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:48.910
<v Speaker 2>that flattery.</v>

2055
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Front leg movement.</v>

2056
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 2>The way that Wonderboy does to Wonderboy is the master of the front leg.</v>

2057
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

2058
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 2>he's the best at standing completely sidekick.</v>

2059
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.390
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2060
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.740
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Johnny Hendricks,</v>

2061
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:00.574
<v Speaker 2>good example,</v>

2062
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 2>he threw a side kick to the body.</v>

2063
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Hendrick stood there and then he went to roundhouse kicked Masta ace with the</v>

2064
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:07.370
<v Speaker 2>same leg masterpiece and,</v>

2065
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>and Hendricks he could see was like fuck.</v>

2066
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Like what does this guy do?</v>

2067
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:11.563
<v Speaker 2>It was like thumb,</v>

2068
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 2>okay back.</v>

2069
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

2070
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Like he thought like,</v>

2071
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:14.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2072
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:15.581
<v Speaker 2>you got me with that,</v>

2073
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:16.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a big deal.</v>

2074
00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:17.141
<v Speaker 2>And then pop,</v>

2075
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:18.490
<v Speaker 2>he gets roundhouse kicked in the face.</v>

2076
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 2>That was a masterful performance.</v>

2077
00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2078
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:21.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2079
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 2>It was one of his best for sure is incredible.</v>

2080
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2081
00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 2>it just shows you the difference between a guy who is,</v>

2082
00:49:26.561 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2083
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:31.830
<v Speaker 2>just trying to like kind of plot in with limited movement and a guy like wonder</v>

2084
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 2>boy who's just one of the most difficult guys to sort of pin down.</v>

2085
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2086
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.833
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

2087
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:38.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2088
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.140
<v Speaker 2>his style is very unique and I'm,</v>

2089
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fascinated with him and I'm really fascinated right now with Michael Venom</v>

2090
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 2>page been watching.</v>

2091
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you see as pro boxing fights?</v>

2092
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:47.381
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2093
00:49:47.381 --> 00:49:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see right now he's a [inaudible].</v>

2094
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:49.791
<v Speaker 2>I saw one.</v>

2095
00:49:49.791 --> 00:49:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2096
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.980
<v Speaker 2>he's a can crusher.</v>

2097
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting these guys then they're setting them up for these,</v>

2098
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2099
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 2>spectacular knockouts.</v>

2100
00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2101
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's still that blitz point karate style that Raymond Daniels has a lot of</v>

2102
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:05.440
<v Speaker 2>these guys have in Raymond's obviously adapted very well for kickboxing.</v>

2103
00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I've changed with Raymond quite a bit.</v>

2104
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.680
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

2105
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.850
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get them on the show and he says,</v>

2106
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:09.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2107
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I have to connect you to.</v>

2108
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2109
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:11.680
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>

2110
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:11.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2111
00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>We had talked a little bit in the past about perhaps doing something on Twitter.</v>

2112
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>He knocks guys out in about 90 seconds on a regular basis.</v>

2113
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.090
<v Speaker 2>And how does he do it?</v>

2114
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:23.050
<v Speaker 2>He does it with the back kick.</v>

2115
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 2>He's the master at finding a place for the back kick.</v>

2116
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to get hit with his back kick.</v>

2117
00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I know you got incredible backache.</v>

2118
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I bet you some more powerful than his.</v>

2119
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.033
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2120
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.143
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you one thing.</v>

2121
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.030
<v Speaker 2>He will fit that back kick everywhere,</v>

2122
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:35.690
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2123
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And he'll do it in a way you won't see it coming.</v>

2124
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.890
<v Speaker 2>And it's gonna hurt so much more.</v>

2125
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.660
<v Speaker 2>But he rarely knucks guys out with his hands.</v>

2126
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:43.220
<v Speaker 2>He does surprise guys with his hands every so often.</v>

2127
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:44.080
<v Speaker 2>But that back kick you,</v>

2128
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:44.923
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be there.</v>

2129
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Well he seems like he's getting better with his hands.</v>

2130
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2131
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2132
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Sands are improving,</v>

2133
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but he trains a lot.</v>

2134
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2135
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.320
<v Speaker 2>And trains a lot that go.</v>

2136
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:50.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2137
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:51.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

2138
00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:51.441
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2139
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 2>he's still at it and he's what,</v>

2140
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 2>35 36 now I would say around that.</v>

2141
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 2>That one was it?</v>

2142
00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:57.613
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2143
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:58.470
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>

2144
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.303
<v Speaker 2>I'm bang.</v>

2145
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Was that the guy he knocked out with that touch front leg side kick and then</v>

2146
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:04.150
<v Speaker 2>jumped on my God,</v>

2147
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 2>the spinning back kick to the face.</v>

2148
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Woo Game Shits.</v>

2149
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe he just jumps up top pop and they had some of the second kick.</v>

2150
00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2151
00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:12.600
<v Speaker 2>double.</v>

2152
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.341
<v Speaker 2>It's a standard.</v>

2153

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.861
<v Speaker 2>for Redmond Dan,</v>

2157
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:17.810
<v Speaker 2>he does it the best I've ever seen personally.</v>

2158
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2159
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 2>no one better.</v>

2160
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 2>You know you to go back to like Rick the jet Rufus.</v>

2161
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.061
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2162
00:51:22.061 --> 00:51:22.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2163
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 2>when he fought that the,</v>

2164
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 2>that really classic fight where he fought that tie fighter and he got his legs</v>

2165
00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:28.640
<v Speaker 2>chopped out and everybody was like,</v>

2166
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

2167
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:30.591
<v Speaker 2>people really got it.</v>

2168
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Understand the Vojtech Moy Tai,</v>

2169
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:34.520
<v Speaker 2>but he hit that guy that same kick,</v>

2170
00:51:34.521 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 2>that front leg side kick him and spun in the air and hit him with the turning</v>

2171
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:38.090
<v Speaker 2>side kick in the face.</v>

2172
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2173
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Man,</v>

2174
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I love watching that point.</v>

2175
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:42.981
<v Speaker 2>Karate style,</v>

2176
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 2>that blitz style.</v>

2177
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2178
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I love watching that enter into MMA because I used to spar with a lot of those</v>

2179
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:52.990
<v Speaker 2>guys and it's fucking hard to deal with those guys that are really good at that,</v>

2180
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:58.020
<v Speaker 2>that that fast sprint at you blitz and when you do that and then you also have</v>

2181
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 2>takedown defense and Muay Thai skills and Jujitsu,</v>

2182
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2183
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.151
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

2184
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:04.130
<v Speaker 2>that's so let's a lethal skill to have.</v>

2185
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

2186
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I love doing boxing.</v>

00:52:09.471 --> 00:52:10.820
<v Speaker 2>I believe all of your right here.</v>

2192
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

2193
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just play that,</v>

2194
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:13.760
<v Speaker 2>play that back again.</v>

2195
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean come on man.</v>

2196
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.120
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking crazy shit.</v>

2197
00:52:17.121 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 2>The way he does it too,</v>

2198
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.460
<v Speaker 2>he just hops up,</v>

2199
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:23.270
<v Speaker 2>touches you with the front leg pains and the second ones and look,</v>

2200
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 2>he looks down like he's in a fucking video game.</v>

2201
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is crazy that this guy is pulling that off.</v>

2202
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.030
<v Speaker 2>That was when he was in glory.</v>

2203
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Look at this tap boom.</v>

2204
00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2205
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:35.730
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

2206
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Well fuck does that.</v>

2207
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 2>And he does that all the time.</v>

2208
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2209
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:40.260
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

2210
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.270
<v Speaker 2>that's not like a one off.</v>

2211
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:41.631
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2212
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:41.871
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2213
00:52:41.871 --> 00:52:42.950
<v Speaker 2>He could do that all day.</v>

2214
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2215
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of those karate guys that have that skillset,</v>

2216
00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 2>they can do like,</v>

2217
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2218
00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 2>those breaking demonstrations with their hold up pads don't do three 60 wheel</v>

2219
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:55.400
<v Speaker 2>kicks and brake pads and I mean there's,</v>

2220
00:52:55.430 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 2>there's some legitimate PR karate and traditional martial arts techniques that</v>

2221
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:01.610
<v Speaker 2>are finding their way into MMA.</v>

2222
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.131
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2223
00:53:02.131 --> 00:53:03.440
<v Speaker 2>You just have to know how to use it.</v>

2224
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.900
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2225
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 2>just because aquatic guy got beat up by a grappler doesn't mean all the karate</v>

2226
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:08.361
<v Speaker 2>he's trained.</v>

2227
00:53:08.361 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

2228
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.531
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2229
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:09.971
<v Speaker 2>These loves,</v>

2230
00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 2>that needs to learn how to grapple.</v>

2231
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.661
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2232
00:53:11.661 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 2>He needs to know how I stay on his feet and he's learning how to grapple and he</v>

2233
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:15.830
<v Speaker 2>needs to learn to set that kickup in a way.</v>

2234
00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Because I think as if you're always fighting another karate guy and then you</v>

2235
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:20.121
<v Speaker 2>fight a boxer,</v>

2236
00:53:20.121 --> 00:53:20.720
<v Speaker 2>the boxer,</v>

2237
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.830
<v Speaker 2>his behavior is just different.</v>

2238
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.461
<v Speaker 2>You have to get you,</v>

2239
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 2>it's like what we're saying before you have to get used to it and then all of a</v>

2240
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 2>sudden you saw the same movie a hundred</v>

2241
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.023
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

2242
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 4>You know how to deal with it.</v>

2243
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:28.261
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2244
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're watching the same movie over and over again.</v>

2245
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:30.864
<v Speaker 4>You start,</v>

2246
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.200
<v Speaker 4>you start predicting what the scene is going to be.</v>

2247
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 4>You're not caught by surprise when you're caught by surprise,</v>

2248
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:36.084
<v Speaker 4>you're done right.</v>

2249
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 4>You'd never done Jitsu before and I'm doing an armbar basic onboard.</v>

2250
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.213
<v Speaker 4>You're getting caught with it.</v>

2251
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:40.891
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2252
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 4>That's why I believe you got to know everything out there,</v>

2253
00:53:42.661 --> 00:53:43.740
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to specialize.</v>

2254
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.041
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

2255
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 4>don't try to master everything.</v>

2256
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 4>Know everything.</v>

2257
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:48.451
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2258
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:50.070
<v Speaker 4>I like to know Doris Triangle.</v>

2259
00:53:50.071 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 4>He'll hook.</v>

2260
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Even though I'm not a necessarily a dark sky,</v>

2261
00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 4>but I want to know everything about Doris.</v>

2262
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to drill it all day long.</v>

2263
00:53:55.471 --> 00:53:56.400
<v Speaker 4>I just want to know about it.</v>

2264
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2265
00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Because when you're trying to put your Darson,</v>

2266
00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're trying to do.</v>

2267
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm familiar with what you're going for.</v>

2268
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.260
<v Speaker 4>I can break out of it.</v>

2269
00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 4>You don't go for Darson.</v>

2270
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:03.781
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2271
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:04.111
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2272
00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:04.351
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2273
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

2274
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2275
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say it's my best submission.</v>

2276
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I do do the arses.</v>

2277
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:09.564
<v Speaker 4>No doubt about it.</v>

2278
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.880
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the longs arms.</v>

2279
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.940
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2280
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.331
<v Speaker 4>Exact.</v>

2281
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever try Japanese Necktie?</v>

2282
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2283
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:15.670
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2284
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't use them that much,</v>

2285
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:17.011
<v Speaker 4>but I am,</v>

2286
00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm familiar with the solution for guys who don't have long arms.</v>

2287
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 4>I have short arms too.</v>

2288
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.980
<v Speaker 4>But the Japanese necktie became a specialist at that when you really,</v>

2289
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.261
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2290
00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:28.530
<v Speaker 4>you get that clamp over the time of the neck and then you drop down with the</v>

2291
00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:31.980
<v Speaker 4>left shoulder and you tuck the head into the forehead and you hook one of the</v>

2292
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:33.020
<v Speaker 4>legs with your legs.</v>

2293
00:54:33.021 --> 00:54:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

2294
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Crack that neck.</v>

2295
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:38.160
<v Speaker 4>So you're pushing in with your chest and then cracking that.</v>

2296
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2297
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.473
<v Speaker 4>it comes,</v>

2307
00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 4>they're not aware of the danger that that one position,</v>

2310
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.200
<v Speaker 4>whenever you feel that arm going underneath your neck,</v>

2356
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I would die.</v>

2357
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:47.280
<v Speaker 4>He would tell you it was there.</v>

2358
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good submission.</v>

2359
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't have worked.</v>

00:55:54.031 --> 00:55:56.700
<v Speaker 4>when you fudge it shields you did a single leg and he took him down.</v>

00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.701
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2371
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:00.121
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>

2372
00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:01.110
<v Speaker 4>you're wrestling is good.</v>

2373
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:02.350
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2374
00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:02.480
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2375
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:02.560
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2376
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:02.720
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2377
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't wrestle a wrestler at all.</v>

2378
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.160
<v Speaker 4>What that was like.</v>

2379
00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:05.701
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

2380
00:56:05.701 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 4>I get what you're trying to say,</v>

2381
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 4>but there's a time of place while wrestle a wrestler.</v>

2382
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 4>When I see a good vulnerability.</v>

2383
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:11.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2384
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.270
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2385
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:12.571
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2386
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:12.661
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2387
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:13.231
<v Speaker 4>he's very,</v>

2388
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 4>I think he's changed over the years.</v>

2389
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:14.941
<v Speaker 4>But when I was,</v>

2390
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:15.571
<v Speaker 4>when I rolled with him,</v>

2391
00:56:15.571 --> 00:56:16.381
<v Speaker 4>he was like at the top.</v>

2392
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:16.531
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2393
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2394
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.820
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't question him.</v>

2395
00:56:17.821 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't write the NL.</v>

2396
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Who am I?</v>

2397
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Who am I to tell him I don't agree.</v>

2398
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:20.911
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2399
00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't like Kimora.</v>

2400
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>He would tell me not too much muscle.</v>

2401
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2402
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said to powerful.</v>

2403
00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:26.250
<v Speaker 4>It's powerful.</v>

2404
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2405
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 4>But when you look at his career,</v>

2406
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2407
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 4>all of the things he doesn't like.</v>

2408
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.390
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2409
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:30.280
<v Speaker 4>that's what he's been caught with.</v>

2410
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Like a radio caught him with a Doris Shakuri Kamora yeah,</v>

2411
00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:35.923
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2412
00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:36.570
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

2413
00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.750
<v Speaker 4>It didn't,</v>

2414
00:56:37.751 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2415
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.640
<v Speaker 4>who else caught him with the Darce and Braulio caught him once or twice.</v>

2416
00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Once I think.</v>

2417
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2418
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:43.700
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>

2420
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.330
<v Speaker 4>they'll caught them with Doris.</v>

2421
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.651
<v Speaker 4>Doris work,</v>

2422
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:48.484
<v Speaker 4>real good data.</v>

2423
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.680
<v Speaker 4>They do like if you have the attributes,</v>

2424
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:51.011
<v Speaker 4>they're great.</v>

2425
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:51.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2426
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Why would he say he does a decent died?</v>

2427
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:53.643
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

2428
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.220
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got short arms and Fab.</v>

2429
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.083
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

2430

2442
00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.150
<v Speaker 4>heavy,</v>

2443
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 4>puts that weight on you and knows how to control and squish.</v>

2444
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 4>Never let my arm get across my body because I know it's over.</v>

2445
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.180
<v Speaker 4>There's two things you never want to give George Kimora because he'll rip your</v>

2446
00:57:19.181 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 4>arm off and too dark.</v>

2447
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2448
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.140
<v Speaker 4>a triangle triangle.</v>

2449
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:23.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2450
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Catholic Hatami Yeah.</v>

2451
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2452
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 4>there's a Rafael Lovato.</v>

2453
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.120
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2454
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 4>he's got a nasty fucking arm trying,</v>

2455
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2456
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.600
<v Speaker 4>he's competing in Beltour now I'm,</v>

2457
00:57:32.601 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm always fascinated when I see like super,</v>

2458
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:39.280
<v Speaker 4>super high level Jujitsu guys that enter into MMA because I'm like,</v>

2459
00:57:39.281 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2460
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.670
<v Speaker 4>well for sure these guys who are used to just training MMA and trained,</v>

2461
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.590
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to know what the fuck it's them.</v>

2462
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 4>When a guy like [inaudible] Gracie grabs him or like a guy like Damien Maia and</v>

2463
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:52.990
<v Speaker 4>we've seen it time and time again,</v>

2464
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:53.310
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2465
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference in the level.</v>

2466
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 4>And so the argument is always,</v>

2467
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 4>should you be just like,</v>

2468
00:57:58.751 --> 00:58:00.160
<v Speaker 4>what's the best way to be?</v>

2469
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Is the best way to be an elite specialist at one particular thing,</v>

2470
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 4>like a Raymond Daniels or a Wonderboy?</v>

2471
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Or is it to be a guy who can kind of do everything really well?</v>

2472
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 4>Like George?</v>

2473
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 4>So here's my perspective on that.</v>

2474
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:14.890
<v Speaker 4>That's such a great question.</v>

2475
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:15.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the heart of training.</v>

2476
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 4>You could flood your system so that,</v>

2477
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.321
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

2478
00:58:20.321 --> 00:58:21.131
<v Speaker 4>When you flood your system,</v>

2479
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:23.140
<v Speaker 4>you're giving your student too many things to master.</v>

2480
00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 4>He's just really not good at anything.</v>

2481
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:26.223
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2482
00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Or you can bottleneck him.</v>

2483
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 4>You're giving him too few skills that people know what he does.</v>

2484
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:31.581
<v Speaker 4>Like for instance,</v>

2485
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:32.500
<v Speaker 4>like classic examples,</v>

2486
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Chuck Liddell,</v>

2487
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 4>he went on a tear for a while,</v>

2488
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.030
<v Speaker 4>but he's still the same guy and after a while the next generation,</v>

2489
00:58:37.031 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 4>they understood what he does.</v>

2490
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:39.670
<v Speaker 4>They understood the pockets where you're safe,</v>

2491
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:40.504
<v Speaker 4>where you're in danger,</v>

2492
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.501
<v Speaker 4>like machine does.</v>

2493
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:42.334
<v Speaker 4>A great example.</v>

2494
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.260
<v Speaker 4>Early on he was such a mystery.</v>

2495
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:44.861
<v Speaker 4>Now we're like,</v>

2496
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:45.071
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2497
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 4>we get what he does.</v>

2498
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.290
<v Speaker 4>We've understood his patterns.</v>

2499
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:50.020
<v Speaker 4>Patterns are huge and fighting and in life period.</v>

2500
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Human beings or pattern detecting machines,</v>

2501
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.910
<v Speaker 4>whether they know it or not,</v>

2502
00:58:54.911 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 4>whether they can verbalize it or not,</v>

2503
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 4>we are pattern detecting machines.</v>

2504
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:00.610
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like sparring a lot because sparring,</v>

2505
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 4>I've had a thousand people throw a right hand at me.</v>

2506
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.930
<v Speaker 4>When you throw your by hand my mind,</v>

2507
00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:07.810
<v Speaker 4>the subconscious is going to compare that right hind you're throwing to a</v>

2508
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 4>thousand different ranch hands I saw and it's going to say it looks matches this</v>

2509
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:11.651
<v Speaker 4>one the most.</v>

2510
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:11.861
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2511
00:59:11.861 --> 00:59:15.910
<v Speaker 4>this is my narrative and this is what I see and this is personally been my</v>

2512
00:59:15.911 --> 00:59:16.421
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

2513
00:59:16.421 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2514
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 4>When I train somebody who's new and you throw a punch at them,</v>

2515
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 4>they flinch,</v>

2516
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.320
<v Speaker 4>why you've overwhelmed</v>

2517
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.153
<v Speaker 5>them with information.</v>

2518
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.780
<v Speaker 5>But after awhile they see a punch and they're relaxed and they see it in eaten</v>

2519
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 5>and it seems slow motion.</v>

2520
00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 5>Cause at first it was too fast for them.</v>

2521
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:30.260
<v Speaker 5>It's too much to compute.</v>

2522
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.001
<v Speaker 5>So my students,</v>

2523
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 5>what I do is I give them a small amount of technique and when they get better I</v>

2524
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 5>give them a new technique.</v>

2525
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 5>So I want them to get a certain level of competence with that technique.</v>

2526
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 5>And my standard is it has to be instinctual.</v>

2527
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 5>If the technique is instinctual,</v>

2528
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:50.141
<v Speaker 5>I've taught it to well meaning if you've done it live on the mat on a regular</v>

2529
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:50.541
<v Speaker 5>basis,</v>

2530
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 5>you execute on a regular basis.</v>

2531
00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not for me not to give you another gym because if I don't give you another</v>

2532
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:55.491
<v Speaker 5>gem,</v>

2533
00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to bottleneck your art.</v>

2534
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 5>You're going to become too predictable.</v>

2535
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 5>But if I give you a gem too early,</v>

2536
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:02.390
<v Speaker 5>if I give you another technique too early,</v>

2537
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm flooding your system.</v>

2538
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm flooding the your game.</v>

2539
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 5>It's your game is just is diluted.</v>

2540
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.931
<v Speaker 5>It's just two weeks.</v>

2541
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:09.531
<v Speaker 5>So with George,</v>

2542
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 5>we're always reinventing George for the next fight.</v>

2543
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 5>We're always adding one new or two new gems depending how much time we have,</v>

2544
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 5>but there's always an x factor when you fight him.</v>

2545
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 5>He's not going to do the same patterns we did the last fight.</v>

2546
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 5>You could watch his tape.</v>

2547
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.363
<v Speaker 5>That's why I told George,</v>

2548
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 5>why is it harder to be championed than to become champion?</v>

2549
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Because when you're champion,</v>

2550
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.460
<v Speaker 5>everybody's watching you in studying your patterns.</v>

2551
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.280
<v Speaker 5>It's a matter of time before you're old news,</v>

2552
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:34.580
<v Speaker 5>so you've got to reinvent yourself before the next fight.</v>

2553
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 5>That's why I didn't want him fighting three times a year.</v>

2554
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.820
<v Speaker 5>I told me to fight twice a year and there were making comparative with Chuck.</v>

2555
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot of heat for that.</v>

2556
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 5>They're like chuck fights three times a year.</v>

2557
01:00:43.071 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 5>George would fight three times a year.</v>

2558
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.781
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

2559
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:45.171
<v Speaker 5>we'll see what,</v>

2560
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

2561
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.890
<v Speaker 5>how hard careers go be.</v>

2562
01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:49.640
<v Speaker 5>I want George to fight twice a year because to reinvent them,</v>

2563
01:00:49.641 --> 01:00:50.540
<v Speaker 5>take six months,</v>

2564
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do that twice a year.</v>

2565
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 5>That way he'll be champion longer.</v>

2566
01:00:54.471 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 5>I told him,</v>

2567
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:56.340
<v Speaker 5>I saw him when he became champ.</v>

2568
01:00:56.341 --> 01:00:56.541
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2569
01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 5>I want you to be champion for 10 years.</v>

2570
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 5>It happens in boxing is gonna Happen to an MMA for the first time?</v>

2571
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.810
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a champion for 10 years.</v>

2572
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.571
<v Speaker 5>I used to tell him that when,</v>

2573
01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:06.560
<v Speaker 5>when he first won the belt and he was like,</v>

2574
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:06.741
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

2575
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 5>How are we gonna do that?</v>

2576
01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:07.910
<v Speaker 5>You're going to read,</v>

2577
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 5>we're going to cycle.</v>

2578
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 5>We're going to do only training camps that last six months.</v>

2579
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.370
<v Speaker 5>You can only really do a 20 cap every six months.</v>

2580
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.570
<v Speaker 5>If you want to hit a new level,</v>

2581
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 5>it takes six months.</v>

2582
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:18.800
<v Speaker 5>Every fight you got to be at a new level and you get to do something.</v>

2583
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:20.630
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows did they haven't seen it before.</v>

2584
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.430
<v Speaker 5>How did you come up with these numbers?</v>

2585
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:22.581
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2586
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:23.510
<v Speaker 5>what made you decide?</v>

2587
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2588
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 5>I read once,</v>

2589
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 5>I read one very influential book called the New Power Program by Michael Colgan.</v>

2590
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:30.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you ever heard of it.</v>

2591
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:31.400
<v Speaker 5>I have heard of the book.</v>

2592
01:01:31.401 --> 01:01:32.234
<v Speaker 5>I haven't read a book.</v>

2593
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.631
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2594
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:32.811
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2595
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 5>there's two programs.</v>

2596
01:01:33.681 --> 01:01:34.514
<v Speaker 5>There's either,</v>

2597
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:35.331
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2598
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:36.164
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2599
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 5>if you can do a training program shorter than six months,</v>

2600
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.350
<v Speaker 5>you're either superman or your like.</v>

2601
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.110
<v Speaker 5>He formulated the way he says,</v>

2602
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:45.950
<v Speaker 5>I never met Superman.</v>

2603
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.230
<v Speaker 5>A real training program is six months long,</v>

2604
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 5>so that's just always really influenced me.</v>

2605
01:01:51.021 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 5>I think his book was really,</v>

2606
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 5>really basic and this is one of the first books I read on training and it really</v>

2607
01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:56.481
<v Speaker 5>influenced me.</v>

2608
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 5>He taught,</v>

2609
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.200
<v Speaker 5>he taught,</v>

2610
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 5>he teaches in the book periodization,</v>

2611
01:01:58.551 --> 01:01:59.900
<v Speaker 5>but he dumbs it down really,</v>

2612
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:00.734
<v Speaker 5>really well.</v>

2613
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 5>So if you read to the pump,</v>

2614
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 5>pompous book on periodization is just too much at intellectual jargon.</v>

2615
01:02:05.841 --> 01:02:07.100
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for a regular Joe,</v>

2616
01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:07.821
<v Speaker 5>especially at the stage.</v>

2617
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 5>I was then to read the book and understand what he's trying to say and I,</v>

2618
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:12.380
<v Speaker 5>it's like today I can understand it,</v>

2619
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 5>but Michael Colgan made it really simple for me and he's like,</v>

2620
01:02:16.371 --> 01:02:16.611
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2621
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 5>if you want to train and reach a new level,</v>

2622
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 5>it takes six months.</v>

2623
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 5>This is</v>

2624
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.290
<v Speaker 4>the body's natural process.</v>

2625
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 4>So it would be like trying to,</v>

2626
01:02:23.701 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2627
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2628
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 4>plant a seed in there having an apple tree in three months.</v>

2629
01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:28.291
<v Speaker 4>Now he says,</v>

2630
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2631
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 4>the apple tree grows at a certain rate.</v>

2632
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 4>So the human body does things at a certain rate.</v>

2633
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 4>There's no way around it.</v>

2634
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:35.761
<v Speaker 4>You need stress,</v>

2635
01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:36.480
<v Speaker 4>you need recovery,</v>

2636
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 4>then you add up the adaptation.</v>

2637
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:38.710
<v Speaker 4>Here's the,</v>

2638
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 4>the cycles you have to go through to reach a new level.</v>

2639
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 4>And it ends with a plyometric cycle.</v>

2640
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:42.931
<v Speaker 4>Not Today.</v>

2641
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't really use that system anymore because I found better ways over the</v>

2642
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2643
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:47.580
<v Speaker 4>It ends with a plyometric cycle.</v>

2644
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Why does it end with a plan?</v>

2645
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 4>You have to hit the speed of your sport.</v>

2646
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

2647
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.390
<v Speaker 4>let's say you do a lot of back squatting.</v>

2648
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:55.801
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2649
01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:56.071
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

2650
01:02:56.071 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 4>Do backs one and your numbers on the back squat go up.</v>

2651
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's going to make you a better fighter?</v>

2652
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2653
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2654
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2655
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.001
<v Speaker 4>So?</v>

2656
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 4>Why do the squatty cause it'll make you stronger.</v>

2657
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:06.181
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2658
01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 4>But does it make you stronger on the field in the octagon?</v>

2659
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 4>It can make you stronger in certain positions in certain positions.</v>

2660
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2661
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Now I think my question was say it can make you stronger in certain positions if</v>

2662
01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:20.250
<v Speaker 4>you can apply that force over a certain time.</v>

2663
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:22.560
<v Speaker 4>So power and strength of two different things.</v>

2664
01:03:22.561 --> 01:03:25.500
<v Speaker 4>Pop strength is can you live that bard weighs 500 pounds.</v>

2665
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 4>You can lift it.</v>

2666
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Okay good.</v>

2667
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.780
<v Speaker 4>Can you get that by off the ground and locked out in 1.5 seconds?</v>

2668
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the question we want to ask for sports.</v>

2669
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 4>How fast can you apply the force?</v>

2670
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 4>That's power force over time.</v>

2671
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 4>A strength over time.</v>

2672
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.500
<v Speaker 4>So when you want to shoot a double,</v>

2673
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.790
<v Speaker 4>like you have to do it in the window.</v>

2674
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 4>So that's why the plyometric phases,</v>

2675
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.290
<v Speaker 4>the last phase is very important that you need to take all that strength you</v>

2676
01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 4>cultivated and translated to a level of speed.</v>

2677
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 4>So I need George to change level and explored in a fraction of a second.</v>

2678
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.120
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I like things like sprinting,</v>

2679
01:03:57.121 --> 01:03:57.811
<v Speaker 4>track and field,</v>

2680
01:03:57.811 --> 01:03:58.180
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

2681
01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 4>These are things done in a short period of time.</v>

2682
01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:01.440
<v Speaker 4>The ground contact,</v>

2683
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 4>the ground force reaction that the time you spent on the ground applying force</v>

2684
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:05.874
<v Speaker 4>into the ground.</v>

2685
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.210
<v Speaker 4>So when you want to apply force on a,</v>

2686
01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:07.681
<v Speaker 4>on a person,</v>

2687
01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 4>you first have to apply the force in the ground and then I ground.</v>

2688
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Then that reaction is applied into the,</v>

2689
01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.891
<v Speaker 4>into your opponent,</v>

2690
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:14.041
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2691
01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:15.480
<v Speaker 4>So every action has an opposite.</v>

2692
01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:16.314
<v Speaker 4>Equal reaction.</v>

2693
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 4>How fast can you apply?</v>

2694
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Apply that force into the ground.</v>

2695
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:20.071
<v Speaker 4>Now squatters.</v>

2696
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 4>If I take you and I make you squat a slow squat down and up the I'm treating you</v>

2697
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:25.560
<v Speaker 4>like a tow truck,</v>

2698
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2699
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Then I measure your vertical jump.</v>

2700
01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:28.711
<v Speaker 4>You're vertical jumps,</v>

2701
01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 4>gonna have gone down after you've done six months of a squatting,</v>

2702
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to have gone up.</v>

2703
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:33.931
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2704
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Because you're training like a tow truck.</v>

2705
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.361
<v Speaker 4>You're telling your body,</v>

2706
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:36.541
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2707
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I need to lift lots of money,</v>

2708
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 4>lots of heavyweights in a slow,</v>

2709
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.560
<v Speaker 4>in a slow fashion.</v>

2710
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.311
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

2711
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:44.790
<v Speaker 4>if I make you do plyometrics or I make you do Olympic lifting and Olympic</v>

2712
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 4>lifting is very fast,</v>

2713
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.180
<v Speaker 4>it's 1.5 second contraction on the hamstring,</v>

2714
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.193
<v Speaker 4>1.5 seconds.</v>

2715
01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.470
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2716
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.770
<v Speaker 4>and there's a certain point where it's 0.5 seconds,</v>

2717
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.930
<v Speaker 4>then I make you a test,</v>

2718
01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:56.730
<v Speaker 4>your vertical now your verticals gone up.</v>

2719
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 4>So there's an element of speed.</v>

2720
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:00.450
<v Speaker 4>So Michael Colgan at the end of the program,</v>

2721
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:03.900
<v Speaker 4>he does a a four week or three week phase of the calls.</v>

2722
01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.750
<v Speaker 4>It the link cycle where you're doing plyometrics is very important.</v>

2723
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

2724
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard it put that way.</v>

2725
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:11.070
<v Speaker 4>And I like that thought.</v>

2726
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:12.780
<v Speaker 4>I liked the thought process behind it.</v>

2727
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a,</v>

2728
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are using a lot of plyometric drills now.</v>

2729
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2730
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.361
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2731
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:24.361
<v Speaker 4>it's way more common when you see like training montage has of guys hopping over</v>

2732
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 4>hurdles.</v>

2733
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 4>But I really have to think that George was one of the first guys I ever saw do</v>

2734
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 4>that stuff.</v>

2735
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.361
<v Speaker 4>I used to tell him,</v>

2736
01:05:29.361 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 4>do you want to treat it like a tow truck or do you want to train like a Ferrari?</v>

2737
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Which one do you want to be [inaudible] if you look at Damien Maia,</v>

2738
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 4>he's like a tow truck.</v>

2739
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:36.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2740
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.271
<v Speaker 4>he stiff.</v>

2741
01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Even when he throws a punch is a very stiff,</v>

2742
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2743
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.671
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2744
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Because years of gait training,</v>

2745
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:41.944
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2746
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2747
01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 4>I've trained my body to make an isometric hold and now your built your body</v>

2748
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:46.330
<v Speaker 4>behaves.</v>

2749
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:47.163
<v Speaker 4>I symmetrically.</v>

2750
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Why you asking you to do anything different?</v>

2751
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.480
<v Speaker 4>I never ask my body to do something in practice that I don't want it to do on</v>

2752
01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.314
<v Speaker 4>fight night.</v>

2753
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 4>So I do believe squatting is important.</v>

2754
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:58.900
<v Speaker 4>Squatting's important to develop a general strength.</v>

2755
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 4>So let's say for instance,</v>

2756
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 4>you're always doing plyometrics.</v>

2757
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.451
<v Speaker 4>White,</v>

2758
01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:02.740
<v Speaker 4>you might have an overuse injury,</v>

2759
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 4>certain muscles not being activated.</v>

2760
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 4>You go on the squat rack,</v>

2761
01:06:05.891 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 4>you do a few squats and I believe you've got to do squats.</v>

2762
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2763
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.030
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2764
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.571
<v Speaker 4>not too heavy,</v>

2765
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 4>about 70% of your Max and do it fast.</v>

2766
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:14.470
<v Speaker 4>You'll still get all the benefits.</v>

2767
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:16.810
<v Speaker 4>What about lowering it Lauren,</v>

2768
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.270
<v Speaker 4>and how do you lower it fast or do you lower it?</v>

2769
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Lower it fast and up fast.</v>

2770
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2771
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2772
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.151
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

2773
01:06:22.151 --> 01:06:22.930
<v Speaker 4>if Fred had field,</v>

2774
01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 4>he's a probably said it best.</v>

2775
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:24.491
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2776
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 4>He said he's the first man to officially squat a thousand pounds.</v>

2777
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:28.571
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2778
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:29.350
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2779
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:30.130
<v Speaker 4>throw a baseball,</v>

2780
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 4>throw a throw a paper,</v>

2781
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:32.471
<v Speaker 4>you take a paper,</v>

2782
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 4>you can pull it up and you throw it,</v>

2783
01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.340
<v Speaker 4>it's too light for it to,</v>

2784
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:36.850
<v Speaker 4>to to go anywhere.</v>

2785
01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.410
<v Speaker 4>You throw it really hard bit because it's so light.</v>

2786
01:06:39.411 --> 01:06:40.244
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't go anywhere.</v>

2787
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 4>Take a bowling ball or bowling balls too heavy,</v>

2788
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 4>throw it doesn't go anywhere.</v>

2789
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:45.490
<v Speaker 4>You take a baseball,</v>

2790
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the right amount of resistance.</v>

2791
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 4>It's the right amount of weight.</v>

2792
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Now you're going to apply more force on that baseball.</v>

2793
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.000
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna get more force out of it.</v>

2794
01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2795
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:53.081
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

2796
01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 4>it's in the goldilocks range.</v>

2797
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.690
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

2798
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.063
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2799
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.940
<v Speaker 4>let's make it really simple.</v>

2800
01:06:57.941 --> 01:06:58.091
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2801
01:06:58.091 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 4>Let's see you way zero pounds.</v>

2802
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 4>I put you on a scale.</v>

2803
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:01.540
<v Speaker 4>You weigh zero pounds.</v>

2804
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 4>You have a bar on your back.</v>

2805
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 4>The bar weighs 100 pounds.</v>

2806
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:05.261
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2807
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:06.250
<v Speaker 4>So we're looking at the scale.</v>

2808
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.830
<v Speaker 4>Now the scale says 100 pounds,</v>

2809
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 4>the bars on your back.</v>

2810
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Let's take away your weight just to make it really simple.</v>

2811
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.740
<v Speaker 4>You go down and up.</v>

2812
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 4>The scale is going to read 101</v>

2813
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 4>that's the minimum amount of power you have to put into that,</v>

2814
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Speaker 4>that that scale for it to come up.</v>

2815
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 4>So when you go down the scale is going to say 100 100 as you come up,</v>

2816
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Speaker 4>it's going to say one on one.</v>

2817
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 4>For it to have a positive trajectory,</v>

2818
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 4>you have to apply 101 pounds upwards,</v>

2819
01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:34.061
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

2820
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:34.451
<v Speaker 4>downward.</v>

2821
01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:35.440
<v Speaker 4>And then reaction will be upwards.</v>

2822
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>If I put that weight on my back,</v>

2823
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 4>if I put 70 pounds,</v>

2824
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 4>if I think 70% of the weight and I go up and down really fast on the scale,</v>

2825
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:48.700
<v Speaker 4>the scale is going to read 101 minimum for me to,</v>

2826
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:51.220
<v Speaker 4>if I explode up really fast,</v>

2827
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:56.080
<v Speaker 4>it's going to read 100100200 three now I got the benefits of a maximum</v>

2828
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:56.914
<v Speaker 4>contraction,</v>

2829
01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 4>let's say 100 pounds with a maximum you can lift,</v>

2830
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 4>but I don't have the weight of a hundred pounds on me.</v>

2831
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:05.291
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2832
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:05.770
<v Speaker 4>somebody who,</v>

2833
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:06.280
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2834
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 4>who really made this popular is a Louie Simmons.</v>

2835
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 4>He learned it from the Russians,</v>

2836
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2837
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:10.670
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>

2838
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:11.503
<v Speaker 4>Have you had him on your show?</v>

2839
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2840
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant trainer.</v>

2841
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.963
<v Speaker 4>He's fascinating.</v>

2842
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant human being too.</v>

2843
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.150
<v Speaker 5>He's out of his mind.</v>

2844
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:17.301
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2845
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 5>we interviewed an Hermes in his gym.</v>

2846
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:19.701
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2847
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:19.971
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2848
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2849
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.021
<v Speaker 5>Columbus,</v>

2850
01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:21.620
<v Speaker 5>it was great.</v>

2851
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.180
<v Speaker 5>But he's a genius when it comes to lifting.</v>

2852
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2853
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.291
<v Speaker 5>he's a genius.</v>

2854
01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 5>He knows what he's talking about.</v>

2855
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.080
<v Speaker 5>He read super training.</v>

2856
01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 5>I also read super training.</v>

2857
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:30.950
<v Speaker 5>It's super training is about lowering the rates to the right amount and doing a</v>

2858
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:31.820
<v Speaker 5>plyometric with it.</v>

2859
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.430
<v Speaker 5>You get the same benefits is using maximum weight,</v>

2860
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 5>but you don't get the side effects,</v>

2861
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:36.981
<v Speaker 5>the soreness,</v>

2862
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:37.641
<v Speaker 5>the injury,</v>

2863
01:08:37.641 --> 01:08:38.331
<v Speaker 5>the red lining.</v>

2864
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:39.200
<v Speaker 5>You don't get anything out of that.</v>

2865
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:43.010
<v Speaker 5>So the Russians found a great way to apply maximum force on the bar,</v>

2866
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 5>but they also get speed.</v>

2867
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 5>They're not training like tow trucks to training like Ferrari's.</v>

2868
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:48.470
<v Speaker 5>That's actually where I got the term from Louie Simmons.</v>

2869
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 5>He really clarified it for me.</v>

2870
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:50.834
<v Speaker 5>Made it really simple.</v>

2871
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:56.350
<v Speaker 5>So like what kind of like say if you could bench press a 315 pounds,</v>

2872
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.590
<v Speaker 5>what would you use?</v>

2873
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 5>You use between 65 to 80% of that weight and it's just real quick,</v>

2874
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.733
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

2875
01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:02.451
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>

2876
01:09:02.451 --> 01:09:06.040
<v Speaker 5>You'll get the same amount of resistance if you do it quickly as if you had the</v>

2877
01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:06.874
<v Speaker 5>maximum weight on it.</v>

2878
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:10.240
<v Speaker 5>So he doesn't use maximum weight except for once a week.</v>

2879
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 5>And the reason why he explains it,</v>

2880
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.333
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

2881
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.801
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2882
01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 5>you have proprioceptors in your system.</v>

2883
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Proprioceptors is like,</v>

2884
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.060
<v Speaker 5>it's what tells you if your arm is up or down.</v>

2885
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:18.260
<v Speaker 5>If your arm is bent to your chest,</v>

2886
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:18.650
<v Speaker 5>if you are,</v>

2887
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:19.060
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2888
01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.570
<v Speaker 5>if I close your eyes and I lift your arm,</v>

2889
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>

2890
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:21.763
<v Speaker 5>you're lifted my arm.</v>

2891
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:21.831
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2892
01:09:21.831 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 5>how do you know that?</v>

2893
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:23.263
<v Speaker 5>Appropriate sectors?</v>

2894
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:24.141
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2895
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:24.471
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2896
01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 5>if you put on a map,</v>

2897
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:25.761
<v Speaker 5>let's say you,</v>

2898
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.360
<v Speaker 5>let's say you're working with um,</v>

2899
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 5>75 pounds and your maximum is a hundred.</v>

2900
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.500
<v Speaker 5>When you go to lift that day and on the competition date,</v>

2901
01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:35.000
<v Speaker 5>when you get a hundred on your bones,</v>

2902
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:36.081
<v Speaker 5>your buddy's going to be like,</v>

2903
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:36.914
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2904
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 5>I've never felt that amount of weight.</v>

2905
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 5>This is Arthur.</v>

2906
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 5>Kinetic reflects,</v>

2907
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.820
<v Speaker 5>shut the muscles down.</v>

2908
01:09:40.821 --> 01:09:41.900
<v Speaker 5>We've never felt that weight.</v>

2909
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 5>This is the narrative that he gives us.</v>

2910
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:44.511
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

2911
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 5>because you've never felt that weight,</v>

2912
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:46.550
<v Speaker 5>your body's going to,</v>

2913
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.221
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to allow you,</v>

2914
01:09:47.221 --> 01:09:48.710
<v Speaker 5>there's a safety mechanism in your body.</v>

2915
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.191
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>

2916
01:09:49.191 --> 01:09:49.311
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2917
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:49.651
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2918
01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 5>this isn't,</v>

2919
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.780
<v Speaker 5>we're not used to this.</v>

2920
01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Let's not take a chance.</v>

2921
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

2922
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:54.620
<v Speaker 5>if you get your body used to that,</v>

2923
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.510
<v Speaker 5>the Ortho kinetic reflex will,</v>

2924
01:09:56.511 --> 01:09:58.390
<v Speaker 5>will quiet down and allow you to lift.</v>

2925
01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:58.930
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2926
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 5>there's an inner mechanism,</v>

2927
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.670
<v Speaker 5>the safety mechanism in the human body.</v>

2928
01:10:01.671 --> 01:10:02.690
<v Speaker 5>So he says to bypass that,</v>

2929
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:08.110
<v Speaker 5>we do heavyweights once a week to two to numb that reflex.</v>

2930
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:09.651
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2931
01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:11.960
<v Speaker 5>but the majority of the work is done with lightened,</v>

2932
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:12.471
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

2933
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:13.610
<v Speaker 5>lighter and fast.</v>

2934
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.451
<v Speaker 5>75%,</v>

2935
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:14.721
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>

2936
01:10:14.721 --> 01:10:19.721
<v Speaker 5>What do you think of like Pavel Tot Selenis principles by the strong first</v>

2937
01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 5>principles of the,</v>

2938
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 5>like say if you could do 10 reps of something you don't do 10,</v>

2939
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:24.854
<v Speaker 5>you do five.</v>

2940
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.873
<v Speaker 5>Exactly right.</v>

2941
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:26.931
<v Speaker 5>How'd you percent?</v>

2942
01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.910
<v Speaker 5>I've read all of [inaudible] works.</v>

2943
01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:29.520
<v Speaker 5>Almost all of them.</v>

2944
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.660
<v Speaker 5>He's brilliant trainer that I agree with that 100% outside of competition.</v>

2945
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Let's explain it to people.</v>

2946
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2947
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:35.350
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2948
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2949
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:35.961
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2950
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:36.291
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>

2951
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:36.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2952
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:36.801
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2953
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:37.730
<v Speaker 5>So let's say for instance,</v>

2954
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.350
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2955
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2956
01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big believer never being sore.</v>

2957
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.220
<v Speaker 5>You should train the next day she'd wake up feeling good.</v>

2958
01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.121
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2959
01:10:44.121 --> 01:10:44.451
<v Speaker 5>And I'll why,</v>

2960
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:45.284
<v Speaker 5>how's that possible?</v>

2961
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.591
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2962
01:10:45.591 --> 01:10:46.880
<v Speaker 5>because look,</v>

2963
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:47.420
<v Speaker 5>if if,</v>

2964
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:47.631
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2965
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:48.090
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>

2966
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:48.923
<v Speaker 5>That's a great example.</v>

2967
01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:49.791
<v Speaker 5>Let's say,</v>

2968
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:50.624
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2969
01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 5>let's see your energy levels as talking about fit people,</v>

2970
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:53.271
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2971
01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:53.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2972
01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.591
<v Speaker 5>Every human being,</v>

2973
01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:56.090
<v Speaker 5>every cell guys never worked out before.</v>

2974
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.310
<v Speaker 5>First Day first,</v>

2975
01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:57.770
<v Speaker 5>they never call.</v>

2976
01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:00.080
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible to work out and not be so no problem.</v>

2977
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

2978
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:06.370
<v Speaker 5>So let's say there's something called cr rate of perceived exertion.</v>

2979
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2980
01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 5>So let's say I make you do pull ups and let's say the maximum on of pull ups you</v>

2981
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.760
<v Speaker 5>can do the maximum out of bill is 10.</v>

2982
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep a nice round number at 11 you couldn't do 11.</v>

2983
01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 5>If I put a pointed a gun at you,</v>

2984
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:20.634
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't do 11.</v>

2985
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:25.400
<v Speaker 5>Should I make you do 10 pull ups on our workout?</v>

2986
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.350
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm going to make you do five.</v>

2987
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.111
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2988
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:29.660
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm setting you up to work the next day.</v>

2989
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.250
<v Speaker 5>The next day we're going to do five and the next day we're going to do another</v>

2990
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Speaker 5>five and then we're going to six.</v>

2991
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.770
<v Speaker 5>When six is really easy,</v>

2992
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.830
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do seven y if you count,</v>

2993
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:38.131
<v Speaker 5>if the,</v>

2994
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 5>if you did 10 pull ups on Monday,</v>

2995
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be sore till Thursday.</v>

2996
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:41.971
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

2997
01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 5>it's really your Max.</v>

2998
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:46.530
<v Speaker 5>So Thursday you've only done 10 pull ups from Monday to Thursday.</v>

2999
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:46.881
<v Speaker 5>Volume done,</v>

3000
01:11:46.881 --> 01:11:47.340
<v Speaker 5>10 pull ups.</v>

3001
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:47.551
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>

3002
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:48.810
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing five pull ups every day,</v>

3003
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:50.400
<v Speaker 5>so I'm at 20 pull ups already.</v>

3004
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 5>25 pullups.</v>

3005
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 5>I have more volume than you now.</v>

3006
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:56.370
<v Speaker 5>If you add up at the end of the year,</v>

3007
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:57.181
<v Speaker 5>who trained?</v>

3008
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:59.130
<v Speaker 5>The more I've trained way more than you.</v>

3009
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 5>So let's say I go to Jitsu practice.</v>

3010
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing Jujitsu every single day.</v>

3011
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.421
<v Speaker 5>Three rounds,</v>

3012
01:12:03.421 --> 01:12:04.021
<v Speaker 5>five days a week.</v>

3013
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 5>That's 15 rounds.</v>

3014
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 5>You go in twice a week,</v>

3015
01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 5>but you kill yourself.</v>

3016
01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:09.330
<v Speaker 5>You do five rounds each day you kill,</v>

3017
01:12:09.331 --> 01:12:09.931
<v Speaker 5>you push yourself.</v>

3018
01:12:09.931 --> 01:12:10.531
<v Speaker 5>Those last two rounds,</v>

3019
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:11.364
<v Speaker 5>you burn yourself out.</v>

3020
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:14.860
<v Speaker 5>I still did 15 you're at 10 at the end of the year.</v>

3021
01:12:14.861 --> 01:12:16.360
<v Speaker 5>I've done countless rounds more than I am.</v>

3022
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.250
<v Speaker 5>I may have had at so much more training than you.</v>

3023
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:22.420
<v Speaker 5>So how much training can we pack in in the week?</v>

3024
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 5>That's the real question.</v>

3025
01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 5>How much volume can you expose your athlete too?</v>

3026
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.840
<v Speaker 5>So I always tell people look energy as,</v>

3027
01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.240
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

3028
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 5>exercise can produce energy.</v>

3029
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 5>So let's say I'm feeling like a seven out of 10 10 being I'm really like</v>

3030
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:36.811
<v Speaker 5>energized one.</v>

3031
01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 5>I was like really lethargic,</v>

3032
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 5>feeling like I need to lay down and seven I'm feeling good.</v>

3033
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3034
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.500
<v Speaker 5>If I get up and I do a right amount of exercise,</v>

3035
01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:47.250
<v Speaker 5>the right amount,</v>

3036
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.820
<v Speaker 5>I can feel like an 8.5 exercise can give me a tonic effect,</v>

3037
01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 5>like drinking this coffee.</v>

3038
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.750
<v Speaker 5>So let's say I just do some jumping jacks.</v>

3039
01:12:53.751 --> 01:12:54.870
<v Speaker 5>It hit the back for a couple of rounds.</v>

3040
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm feeling good.</v>

3041
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 5>Once you get that high,</v>

3042
01:12:57.091 --> 01:12:57.924
<v Speaker 5>shut it down.</v>

3043
01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Don't go into the phase where your body's beat up,</v>

3044
01:13:01.071 --> 01:13:01.461
<v Speaker 5>tight,</v>

3045
01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:02.240
<v Speaker 5>broken up.</v>

3046
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Don't redline the body.</v>

3047
01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.910
<v Speaker 5>That's only for training camps for P for a small period of time.</v>

3048
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:08.061
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3049
01:13:08.061 --> 01:13:09.980
<v Speaker 5>Because you get a little bit more from the system,</v>

3050
01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.440
<v Speaker 5>but in the long run you get less.</v>

3051
01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:13.791
<v Speaker 5>In the long run,</v>

3052
01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:14.780
<v Speaker 5>you've tax the system.</v>

3053
01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.520
<v Speaker 5>So if you do that regularly,</v>

3054
01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.990
<v Speaker 5>by the time you actually get good,</v>

3055
01:13:17.991 --> 01:13:18.824
<v Speaker 5>you'll be broken up.</v>

3056
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.460
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

3057
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 5>That's why I do a lot of flow.</v>

3058
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:21.170
<v Speaker 5>And have you ever,</v>

3059
01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:23.720
<v Speaker 5>have you ever heard of a Mihai send me high as a,</v>

3060
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:24.680
<v Speaker 5>a flow?</v>

3061
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:25.810
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3062
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:26.021
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3063
01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:27.070
<v Speaker 5>So you can you,</v>

3064
01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:27.791
<v Speaker 5>can you Jamie,</v>

3065
01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 5>can you look up a flowchart?</v>

3066
01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.830
<v Speaker 5>It'd be so much simpler.</v>

3067
01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Like just put in flow a flow in the workplace,</v>

3068
01:13:33.281 --> 01:13:33.911
<v Speaker 5>a flow chart.</v>

3069
01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:34.391
<v Speaker 5>This is such,</v>

3070
01:13:34.391 --> 01:13:35.290
<v Speaker 5>this is pure genius.</v>

3071
01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:36.160
<v Speaker 5>This guy is pure genius.</v>

3072
01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:36.431
<v Speaker 5>Basically.</v>

3073
01:13:36.431 --> 01:13:37.630
<v Speaker 5>He went and he,</v>

3074
01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:37.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3075
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.950
<v Speaker 5>he coined the term flow.</v>

3076
01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:40.150
<v Speaker 5>So like when you're in a state of flow,</v>

3077
01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:41.410
<v Speaker 5>we've all been in a state of flow.</v>

3078
01:13:41.411 --> 01:13:42.244
<v Speaker 5>The number one</v>

3079
01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.020
<v Speaker 5>way to know that you're in a state of flow.</v>

3080
01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.240
<v Speaker 5>As time flies by,</v>

3081
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:48.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some somebody you've done podcasts and you're like,</v>

3082
01:13:48.361 --> 01:13:48.711
<v Speaker 5>what was it,</v>

3083
01:13:48.711 --> 01:13:49.544
<v Speaker 5>three hours already?</v>

3084
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

3085
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.780
<v Speaker 5>it was a great podcast.</v>

3086
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:52.321
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3087
01:13:52.321 --> 01:13:54.110
<v Speaker 5>the one where you have the worst guest or you're,</v>

3088
01:13:54.111 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 5>you're having the worst workout.</v>

3089
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:56.670
<v Speaker 5>It feels like every minute is an hour.</v>

3090
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.823
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad,</v>

3091
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.100
<v Speaker 5>you're not in a state of Florida.</v>

3092
01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 5>State of flow is you're having the right amount of difficulty,</v>

3093
01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:06.210
<v Speaker 5>but it's not so difficult that you go into stress and it's not so easy that</v>

3094
01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 5>you're bored.</v>

3095
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.220
<v Speaker 5>It's the right amount of challenge.</v>

3096
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 5>So let's see it as simple as playing it like tetris.</v>

3097
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 5>If I put you on a,</v>

3098
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 5>if I put you on a level that's too high,</v>

3099
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.610
<v Speaker 5>you can be like you're going to play for five minutes and be like,</v>

3100
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:16.444
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

3101
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.430
<v Speaker 5>I put you on a level two easy.</v>

3102
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:18.851
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be like,</v>

3103
01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:19.684
<v Speaker 5>this is boring.</v>

3104
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.660
<v Speaker 5>If I put you on the right amount of level,</v>

3105
01:14:21.661 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 5>you see that as the flow channel.</v>

3106
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 5>So if the challenge is too high,</v>

3107
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 5>you'll meet anxiety.</v>

3108
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 5>If it's too low,</v>

3109
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:29.620
<v Speaker 5>your border.</v>

3110
01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 5>When I go in the practice room,</v>

3111
01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:31.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to create flow.</v>

3112
01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm having fun at training should be addictive.</v>

3113
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 5>Imagine training was addictive.</v>

3114
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.430
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would train everybody to be fit,</v>

3115
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 5>but people always go into anxiety.</v>

3116
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.641
<v Speaker 5>They go and they kill.</v>

3117
01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 5>They're slammed their body.</v>

3118
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Then I have to convince you to do it again three days later,</v>

3119
01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:46.481
<v Speaker 5>two days later,</v>

3120
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:46.811
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

3121
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:47.644
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3122
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.630
<v Speaker 5>the mental energy is going to take me to get there.</v>

3123
01:14:49.631 --> 01:14:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Like it shouldn't be.</v>

3124
01:14:51.101 --> 01:14:51.934
<v Speaker 5>It should be.</v>

3125
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Training should be a pulling force.</v>

3126
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.551
<v Speaker 5>It should be pulling you.</v>

3127
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 5>You want to go training.</v>

3128
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.190
<v Speaker 5>If you don't want to go train it,</v>

3129
01:14:57.191 --> 01:14:57.761
<v Speaker 5>it's not fun.</v>

3130
01:14:57.761 --> 01:14:58.361
<v Speaker 5>If it's not fun,</v>

3131
01:14:58.361 --> 01:14:59.194
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna do a lot of it.</v>

3132
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.000
<v Speaker 5>And if you're not going to do a lot of it,</v>

3133
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to reach mastery.</v>

3134
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:03.610
<v Speaker 5>So how do I make it pleasurable?</v>

3135
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:04.444
<v Speaker 5>How to make it fun?</v>

3136
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 5>I have to be in a flow state and you can get into a flow state in almost</v>

3137
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:08.614
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

3138
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.820
<v Speaker 5>But when you're out of that flow state,</v>

3139
01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:10.683
<v Speaker 5>cut it.</v>

3140
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:12.580
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get further.</v>

3141
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 5>We're going to do more training if we cut it today and come back in tomorrow.</v>

3142
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:19.420
<v Speaker 5>Cause I'm a big believer in consistency over intensity.</v>

3143
01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 5>Intensity should be done one in a once in a while because by nature,</v>

3144
01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.690
<v Speaker 5>intensity can only be done once in a while.</v>

3145
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 5>If you're going hard every day,</v>

3146
01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:28.150
<v Speaker 5>you're not really going hard every day.</v>

3147
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 5>You can't go your Max everyday.</v>

3148
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:29.981
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

3149
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:30.371
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

3150
01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 5>there's a cost to going to your Max.</v>

3151
01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 5>Can you sprint every single day and you cannot sprint every single day.</v>

3152
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.813
<v Speaker 5>It's ludicrous.</v>

3153
01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 5>You could sprint once or twice a week.</v>

3154
01:15:38.171 --> 01:15:40.030
<v Speaker 5>The best sprinters in the world is print once or twice a week.</v>

3155
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's sprints every day because intensity by nature entails that you need to</v>

3156
01:15:45.601 --> 01:15:48.040
<v Speaker 5>take a break because if you don't need to take a break,</v>

3157
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 5>you didn't really go to your maximum intensity.</v>

3158
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.060
<v Speaker 5>If you lift your maximum lift,</v>

3159
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:53.890
<v Speaker 5>the maximum amount of reps you can,</v>

3160
01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.780
<v Speaker 5>the maximum weight you can lift.</v>

3161
01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:58.090
<v Speaker 5>If you do two reps that was in your Max,</v>

3162
01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 5>because if it was you wouldn't have have a second revenue.</v>

3163
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.230
<v Speaker 5>Understand what would have to give you a break for you have a second rep.</v>

3164
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.480
<v Speaker 5>So we didn't find your true Max.</v>

3165
01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3166
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 5>Intensity maximum effort entails you have to stop because it's the maximum.</v>

3167
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:14.350
<v Speaker 5>There was no more reserves.</v>

3168
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.120
<v Speaker 5>There are no more reserve.</v>

3169
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.080
<v Speaker 5>So what do you think about people that they'd say,</v>

3170
01:16:17.081 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 5>there's no such news overturning.</v>

3171
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.500
<v Speaker 5>Here's the John Denver,</v>

3172
01:16:21.501 --> 01:16:22.790
<v Speaker 5>our narrative and that I'll add.</v>

3173
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.030
<v Speaker 5>And he said he coins it really,</v>

3174
01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:25.481
<v Speaker 5>really well.</v>

3175
01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:25.751
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3176
01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3177
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:27.400
<v Speaker 5>it's under arrest.</v>

3178
01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.261
<v Speaker 5>So he says,</v>

3179
01:16:29.261 --> 01:16:29.441
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3180
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 5>you can overtrain if you didn't give your body the rest later.</v>

3181
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:32.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3182
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.131
<v Speaker 5>But he says,</v>

3183
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3184
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.470
<v Speaker 5>no matter how hard I push in practice,</v>

3185
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:36.640
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't kill myself,</v>

3186
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:38.081
<v Speaker 5>I can rest from it.</v>

3187
01:16:38.081 --> 01:16:40.390
<v Speaker 5>Then recover and have super comp compensation.</v>

3188
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:41.403
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>

3189
01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Some guys have made great strides with just mental fortitude and mental</v>

3190
01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 5>strength.</v>

3191
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Overtrained the shit out of themselves.</v>

3192
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.161
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3193
01:16:48.161 --> 01:16:48.994
<v Speaker 5>but can I ask you this?</v>

3194
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3195
01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:50.531
<v Speaker 5>They were successful.</v>

3196
01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3197
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3198
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 5>But their body's breakdown,</v>

3199
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:52.900
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3200
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:53.591
<v Speaker 5>But they could,</v>

3201
01:16:53.591 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 5>could they have been better if they used flow?</v>

3202
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:58.600
<v Speaker 5>Exactly as good as I say,</v>

3203
01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.010
<v Speaker 5>Dan Gable for exempt,</v>

3204
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:00.131
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3205
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Example,</v>

3206
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.570
<v Speaker 5>like w Dan Gable essentially was done in his twenties right?</v>

3207
01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.351
<v Speaker 5>In terms of like,</v>

3208
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:06.700
<v Speaker 5>his body's broken down.</v>

3209
01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:07.181
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3210
01:17:07.181 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 5>Knee replacements,</v>

3211
01:17:08.081 --> 01:17:09.010
<v Speaker 5>hip replacements,</v>

3212
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.033
<v Speaker 5>that kind of deal.</v>

3213
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.760
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>

3214
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Who Wins more often?</v>

3215
01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.820
<v Speaker 5>Russians or American wrestlers rations.</v>

3216
01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 5>Every time an American wrestler wins.</v>

3217
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.090
<v Speaker 5>He's like some pro prodigy.</v>

3218
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 5>He's rare.</v>

3219
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.411
<v Speaker 5>It's rare.</v>

3220
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 5>It does happen,</v>

3221
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.540
<v Speaker 5>but it's rarely is a technical master,</v>

3222
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3223
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:21.591
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3224
01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:23.150
<v Speaker 5>you have these Russian guys that win gold medals,</v>

3225
01:17:23.151 --> 01:17:25.670
<v Speaker 5>you've never heard of them and they're like Michael Jordan's of the sport.</v>

3226
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 5>There's just so many of them.</v>

3227
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 5>They train long consistent practices.</v>

3228
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Whereas in America we do Monday,</v>

3229
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Wednesday,</v>

3230
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.291
<v Speaker 5>Friday,</v>

3231
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:33.771
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>

3232
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:35.930
<v Speaker 5>we kill it and then you rest use your Thursday.</v>

3233
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:40.100
<v Speaker 5>The Eastern Block had a totally different understanding there like it's volume,</v>

3234
01:17:40.101 --> 01:17:40.431
<v Speaker 5>volume,</v>

3235
01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 5>volume near the fight,</v>

3236
01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:43.190
<v Speaker 5>short and intense.</v>

3237
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.230
<v Speaker 5>Only near the the competition phase,</v>

3238
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.110
<v Speaker 5>but before that it's the maximum amount of volume.</v>

3239
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:51.050
<v Speaker 5>You can imagine me and you were or where to athletes a,</v>

3240
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:51.291
<v Speaker 5>and B,</v>

3241
01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.124
<v Speaker 5>your a and B,</v>

3242
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 5>you're training Jujitsu three times a week.</v>

3243
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:54.171
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

3244
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:55.004
<v Speaker 5>really hard.</v>

3245
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.810
<v Speaker 5>You're going all out.</v>

3246
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm training Jiu Jitsu every single day.</v>

3247
01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 5>My average practice is two hours.</v>

3248
01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.570
<v Speaker 5>Your average practice is two hours,</v>

3249
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:03.231
<v Speaker 5>but when you go in,</v>

3250
01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 5>you kill it like you,</v>

3251
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

3252
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.740
<v Speaker 5>you go with all the black belts and you kill it.</v>

3253
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.690
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the year.</v>

3254
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:12.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm averaging three practices are two practices more than you.</v>

3255
01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 5>So I've had a hundred practices more than you by the end of the year,</v>

3256
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.480
<v Speaker 5>104 practice.</v>

3257
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Let's give two weeks for vacation.</v>

3258
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:22.460
<v Speaker 5>Hundred practices more than you to 100 hours more than you had been training.</v>

3259
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.600
<v Speaker 5>When we roll,</v>

3260
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:26.150
<v Speaker 5>your intensity that you put on the mat is going to be irrelevant.</v>

3261
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:26.301
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3262
01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Cause I've also tasted that intensity periodically.</v>

3263
01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.560
<v Speaker 5>It's not that much of a factor.</v>

3264
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 5>Now when you go super aggressive on me,</v>

3265
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.340
<v Speaker 5>when you talk me aggressively,</v>

3266
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I have felt that I know how to deal with it.</v>

3267
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:40.610
<v Speaker 5>Plus I have an extra hundred hours on you 200 hours so I'm going to mangle you.</v>

3268
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.823
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3269
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.750
<v Speaker 5>The volume is far more important than the intensity.</v>

3270
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:47.030
<v Speaker 5>The intensity by nature is neat,</v>

3271
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.920
<v Speaker 5>is neat to be done periodically.</v>

3272
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:51.440
<v Speaker 5>If you do everyday it's light intensity.</v>

3273
01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.810
<v Speaker 5>So how the Russians is,</v>

3274
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 5>how do they structure their training?</v>

3275
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:55.190
<v Speaker 5>They're more playful,</v>

3276
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3277
01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:56.564
<v Speaker 5>they kind of like,</v>

3278
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.590
<v Speaker 5>they kind of warm up,</v>

3279
01:18:57.591 --> 01:18:58.251
<v Speaker 5>they kind of float all.</v>

3280
01:18:58.251 --> 01:18:58.851
<v Speaker 5>They kind of like,</v>

3281
01:18:58.851 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 5>they do a lot of technique,</v>

3282
01:18:59.721 --> 01:19:00.680
<v Speaker 5>high emphasis on technique.</v>

3283
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:01.880
<v Speaker 5>Now a lot of people hearing this are gonna be like,</v>

3284
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:02.331
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3285
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:03.890
<v Speaker 5>the Russians also are funded by their government.</v>

3286
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.340
<v Speaker 5>Their government supports them a lot more than maybe an American,</v>

3287
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.210
<v Speaker 5>a wrestler.</v>

3288
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.781
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3289
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:09.351
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that.</v>

3290
01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:10.184
<v Speaker 5>There are many factors,</v>

3291
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>

3292
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:14.380
<v Speaker 5>we can't deny that they're technically hates it,</v>

3293
01:19:14.381 --> 01:19:15.141
<v Speaker 5>the word superior,</v>

3294
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 5>but they're technically more advanced.</v>

3295
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 5>Technically when it comes to wrestling,</v>

3296
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 5>they have a more of a flow understanding.</v>

3297
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:20.660
<v Speaker 5>They play around in it and it,</v>

3298
01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3299
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:22.910
<v Speaker 5>and the practice gets more and more intense,</v>

3300
01:19:22.911 --> 01:19:23.744
<v Speaker 5>more and more intense.</v>

3301
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.800
<v Speaker 5>Until you see them going really,</v>

3302
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:25.251
<v Speaker 5>really hard.</v>

3303
01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:25.881
<v Speaker 5>They're going live,</v>

3304
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:26.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3305
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:27.051
<v Speaker 5>they're going to really,</v>

3306
01:19:27.051 --> 01:19:27.501
<v Speaker 5>really rough,</v>

3307
01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 5>but they were playing to have a more playful attitude.</v>

3308
01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Look at the Cubans.</v>

3309
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:32.360
<v Speaker 5>You ever see Cubans aspiring,</v>

3310
01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:34.190
<v Speaker 5>they're like 50 guys in the room.</v>

3311
01:19:34.191 --> 01:19:34.941
<v Speaker 5>They're just touch boring.</v>

3312
01:19:34.941 --> 01:19:35.930
<v Speaker 5>There's no head gear.</v>

3313
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.040
<v Speaker 5>There's no mat on the floor.</v>

3314
01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:38.360
<v Speaker 5>They're literally sparring on concrete.</v>

3315
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.950
<v Speaker 5>You think they're really trying to drop each other?</v>

3316
01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:40.784
<v Speaker 5>They're on concrete.</v>

3317
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:41.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3318
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.240
<v Speaker 5>the Cubans are the top boxers.</v>

3319
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:45.890
<v Speaker 5>They're consistently win gold medals.</v>

3320
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 5>But in practice from their playful,</v>

3321
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:47.931
<v Speaker 5>nobody gets hurt.</v>

3322
01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 5>Like you're saying the ties,</v>

3323
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:49.960
<v Speaker 5>ties or just if,</v>

3324
01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.080
<v Speaker 5>if you go in there and you,</v>

3325
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 5>and you kick a tire really hard,</v>

3326
01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 5>he won't spar with you anymore.</v>

3327
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.961
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

3328
01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 5>this guy's tools to amateur.</v>

3329
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.823
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3330
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.490
<v Speaker 5>There's a time and place for intensity.</v>

3331
01:19:58.491 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm not anti intensity.</v>

3332
01:19:59.481 --> 01:20:02.660
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's a time and place like Angelo Dundee was probably arguably</v>

3333
01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 5>the greatest boxing trainer in history.</v>

3334
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.701
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

3335
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:05.150
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3336
01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 5>fighting's for fight night in practice,</v>

3337
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 5>it's only</v>

3338
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.023
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

3339
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>George Saint Pierre has that attitude and I think that's why he's so good and so</v>

3340
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:13.440
<v Speaker 2>healthy today.</v>

3341
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:14.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3342
01:20:14.491 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 2>because he never hurts a sparring partners.</v>

3343
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>People line up to one a spar with him.</v>

3344
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a joy to spar with them.</v>

3345
01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:19.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3346
01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:20.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3347
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I love this idea and I'd love this approach.</v>

3348
01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.161
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

3349
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:23.994
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3350
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:24.720
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3351
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>we have this attitude that you have to be tough and we have this attitude that</v>

3352
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to work hard.</v>

3353
01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:29.724
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3354
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:30.421
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3355
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I've fallen prey to that many,</v>

3356
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>many times in my life.</v>

3357
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Or you just gotta be tougher.</v>

3358
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:35.160
<v Speaker 2>You got to work out harder.</v>

3359
01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 2>You got to push harder,</v>

3360
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 2>but when I read Pavel stuff,</v>

3361
01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things that struck me is like,</v>

3362
01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:42.181
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

3363
01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:42.811
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

3364
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:47.120
<v Speaker 2>If you just do five reps every day and then you won't be sore,</v>

3365
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:49.170
<v Speaker 2>you could do it more often and then your body,</v>

3366
01:20:49.171 --> 01:20:50.460
<v Speaker 2>like you get farmer strength.</v>

3367
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Exactly where it's farmer strength come from farmers.</v>

3368
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to exhaustion.</v>

3369
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh you know,</v>

3370
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:57.620
<v Speaker 2>they're not throwing hail big bales,</v>

3371
01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Hay Bales to the point where you know they literally,</v>

3372
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:02.640
<v Speaker 2>they're heaving and they'll put their hands and knees and like come on five</v>

3373
01:21:02.641 --> 01:21:03.474
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

3374
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.250
<v Speaker 2>You should never be solar.</v>

3375
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.271
<v Speaker 2>If you're sore,</v>

3376
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:07.050
<v Speaker 2>you over did it.</v>

3377
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3378
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause I can't train the next day.</v>

3379
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:09.520
<v Speaker 2>If I'm sore,</v>

3380
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I open the wound every time I work out.</v>

3381
01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Then with that I said,</v>

3382
01:21:12.931 --> 01:21:13.764
<v Speaker 2>I've overdone it.</v>

3383
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Worked out to you.</v>

3384
01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:15.684
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

3385
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.891
<v Speaker 2>you may have,</v>

3386
01:21:16.891 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 2>you got to,</v>

3387
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people listening to this right now.</v>

3388
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.943
<v Speaker 2>I'll wait a minute.</v>

3389
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck make your workouts a seven out of 10 and do them every day?</v>

3390
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get far more training hours.</v>

3391
01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:27.720
<v Speaker 2>You're going to spike your mat.</v>

3392
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 2>You're going to spike your metabolism far more often,</v>

3393
01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:31.380
<v Speaker 2>your energy levels,</v>

3394
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:33.240
<v Speaker 2>your mood is going to be far more,</v>

3395
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3396
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3397
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 2>up and,</v>

3398
01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.250
<v Speaker 2>and training is going to be more addictive.</v>

3399
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:38.581
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3400
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 2>what kind of training do you do at this stage?</v>

3401
01:21:40.621 --> 01:21:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not competing,</v>

3402
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.160
<v Speaker 2>but you're constantly in their sparring with guys who are professionals and</v>

3403
01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly training them.</v>

3404
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of stuff do you do?</v>

3405
01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3406
01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I do Jujitsu,</v>

3407
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.660
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

3408
01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Moitai and a small amount of conditioning.</v>

3409
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 2>After practice I'll do,</v>

3410
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:54.091
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3411
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:54.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm too bored.</v>

3412
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I find jumping hurdles and throwing it like we're doing the weights and stuff.</v>

3413
01:21:59.160 --> 01:21:59.731
<v Speaker 2>Me Personally,</v>

3414
01:21:59.731 --> 01:22:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that as enjoy.</v>

3415
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to take that much enjoyment of it.</v>

3416
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:05.220
<v Speaker 2>I can do five to 20 minutes in a practice.</v>

3417
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that because barring is just so fun,</v>

3418
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:08.040
<v Speaker 2>so much fun.</v>

3419
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a flow state.</v>

3420
01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:09.511
<v Speaker 2>We're having fun.</v>

3421
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:09.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3422
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 2>we're wrestling with I think condition.</v>

3423
01:22:11.671 --> 01:22:12.331
<v Speaker 2>You can't get away with it.</v>

3424
01:22:12.331 --> 01:22:13.140
<v Speaker 2>You need it.</v>

3425
01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:13.450
<v Speaker 2>He needed,</v>

3426
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.900
<v Speaker 2>and we've got to talk about what George was saying on your podcast that he</v>

3427
01:22:15.901 --> 01:22:17.050
<v Speaker 2>doesn't do strength and conditioning and there's,</v>

3428
01:22:17.051 --> 01:22:18.150
<v Speaker 2>there's a language issue there.</v>

3429
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't think and what we gotta talk about that because we've done tremendous</v>

3430
01:22:21.901 --> 01:22:23.160
<v Speaker 2>amounts of strength and conditioning.</v>

3431
01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Me and George like tremendous like barrels full.</v>

3432
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3433
01:22:26.190 --> 01:22:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3434
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.080
<v Speaker 2>but he has a different definition.</v>

3435
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.261
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3436
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a misunderstanding.</v>

3437
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:29.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3438
01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:31.140
<v Speaker 2>So I really want to clarify that,</v>

3439
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.140
<v Speaker 2>but me personally,</v>

3440
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.760
<v Speaker 2>if we roll for an hour for me to pass like this,</v>

3441
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 2>cause it's so fun.</v>

3442
01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:37.771
<v Speaker 2>It's so fun.</v>

3443
01:22:37.771 --> 01:22:38.371
<v Speaker 2>We're having a good time.</v>

3444
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:39.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated.</v>

3445
01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:39.751
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated.</v>

3446
01:22:39.751 --> 01:22:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Like you grabbed it like this.</v>

3447
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

3448
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm always learning new things,</v>

3449
01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:43.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3450
01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3451
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.930
<v Speaker 2>to the swing a kettle bell to do push ups,</v>

3452
01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:46.290
<v Speaker 2>pull ups.</v>

3453
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I can only do that for a finite amount of time.</v>

3454
01:22:48.121 --> 01:22:48.940
<v Speaker 2>So I'll put a timer,</v>

3455
01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:49.411
<v Speaker 2>three rounds,</v>

3456
01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:52.170
<v Speaker 2>two minutes and I'm doing it and I bite the bullet and I do it.</v>

3457
01:22:52.171 --> 01:22:53.004
<v Speaker 2>That keeps me healthy.</v>

3458
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 2>But I don't go in practice to just do that.</v>

3459
01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:56.123
<v Speaker 2>That I never do.</v>

3460
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It's always after my workout.</v>

3461
01:22:58.171 --> 01:22:59.004
<v Speaker 2>After I do Jujitsu.</v>

3462
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3463
01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.870
<v Speaker 2>you'll never have a day where you say,</v>

3464
01:23:00.871 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 2>today I'm going to do Olympic lifting.</v>

3465
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3466
01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Muhammad Ali ever done Mohammed Ali,</v>

3467
01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 2>never</v>

3468
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:07.480
<v Speaker 4>he box and they needed this.</v>

3469
01:23:07.481 --> 01:23:08.101
<v Speaker 4>Conditioning me.</v>

3470
01:23:08.101 --> 01:23:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Whether it does this conditioning,</v>

3471
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:09.874
<v Speaker 4>then he boxes.</v>

3472
01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:11.230
<v Speaker 4>The aid always came together.</v>

3473
01:23:11.231 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3474
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.551
<v Speaker 4>When I go to the gym,</v>

3475
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:13.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go to have fun,</v>

3476
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:14.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go wrestle,</v>

3477
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.791
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go box,</v>

3478
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have a blast and I'm going to grab the kettle bell.</v>

3479
01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:19.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do a few presses,</v>

3480
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do a few Turkish getups and I'm done because I need to have some</v>

3481
01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:24.101
<v Speaker 4>general fitness.</v>

3482
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:24.911
<v Speaker 4>You have general fitness,</v>

3483
01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 4>then you have specific fitness.</v>

3484
01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Specific fitness is to get better at my sport.</v>

3485
01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:31.000
<v Speaker 4>General fitness to keep me healthy,</v>

3486
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:36.270
<v Speaker 4>strong and allow me to reach new levels of athleticism that later in longterm</v>

3487
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 4>can translate to my sport later.</v>

3488
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 4>But if you just do your sport,</v>

3489
01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:41.104
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

3490
01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 4>your system's going to break down,</v>

3491
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.150
<v Speaker 4>your back's gonna break down,</v>

3492
01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 4>your knees going to break down,</v>

3493
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.100
<v Speaker 4>your shoulders going to break down.</v>

3494
01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 4>You need to stimulate certain muscles that are not getting stimulation in your</v>

3495
01:23:49.331 --> 01:23:50.320
<v Speaker 4>specific sport.</v>

3496
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 4>You create atrophy and certain muscles cause you're not using them.</v>

3497
01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 4>Really I need to work my stabilizers.</v>

3498
01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:57.330
<v Speaker 4>I need to swing the Kettlebell,</v>

3499
01:23:57.370 --> 01:23:58.061
<v Speaker 4>I need to squat,</v>

3500
01:23:58.061 --> 01:24:00.040
<v Speaker 4>I need to do certain exercises.</v>

3501
01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.701
<v Speaker 4>Like what are the,</v>

3502
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 4>what are their standard course?</v>

3503
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Kettle bells for.</v>

3504
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Is that like triple extension is number one.</v>

3505
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:06.730
<v Speaker 4>So any type of squatting maneuver.</v>

3506
01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:08.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't particularly use the squat.</v>

3507
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.110
<v Speaker 4>I like to use extension.</v>

3508
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:09.821
<v Speaker 4>Triple extension.</v>

3509
01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 4>So your knee,</v>

3510
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.180
<v Speaker 4>hip and ankle are bending also like a squat,</v>

3511
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:13.691
<v Speaker 4>your knee,</v>

3512
01:24:13.691 --> 01:24:14.530
<v Speaker 4>hip and ankle or Benny.</v>

3513
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I like to jump.</v>

3514
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I like to throw the Med ball a lot against the wall.</v>

3515
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I like to do a hurdles.</v>

3516
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I can do box jumps.</v>

3517
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:22.690
<v Speaker 4>I like to very low impact parametrics.</v>

3518
01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:23.471
<v Speaker 4>I like sprinting.</v>

3519
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Sprinting is huge.</v>

3520
01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:25.720
<v Speaker 4>You ever do the be test?</v>

3521
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

3522
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh you got,</v>

3523
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you got the space for the beep test here.</v>

3524
01:24:28.811 --> 01:24:29.531
<v Speaker 4>You've got to implement.</v>

3525
01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 4>What it does is the best way to do cardio.</v>

3526
01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:31.731
<v Speaker 4>You ever hear the,</v>

3527
01:24:31.731 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 4>the soccer players uses a lot.</v>

3528
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a beat,</v>

3529
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:33.311
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3530
01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 4>You run,</v>

3531
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 4>you beep and then it beeps back.</v>

3532
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.760
<v Speaker 4>And the faster the beeps go,</v>

3533
01:24:36.761 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 4>the faster you have to run.</v>

3534
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

3535
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.080
<v Speaker 4>that's really amazing because what I do is I set a timer for five minutes.</v>

3536
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.490
<v Speaker 4>I put it on a high pace,</v>

3537
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:45.610
<v Speaker 4>like I'll put a 10 or 11 and I'll just shuttle back and forth.</v>

3538
01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.211
<v Speaker 4>And it keeps,</v>

3539
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.130
<v Speaker 4>it tells you how fast to run to beat test.</v>

3540
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 4>And some days I'll feel really good.</v>

3541
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I'll do 11 cause I know how fast I have to run to keep up with the beats and</v>

3542
01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:54.850
<v Speaker 4>that just,</v>

3543
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:55.840
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing for cardio.</v>

3544
01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:56.351
<v Speaker 4>It's short,</v>

3545
01:24:56.351 --> 01:24:56.711
<v Speaker 4>sweet,</v>

3546
01:24:56.711 --> 01:24:57.544
<v Speaker 4>painless,</v>

3547
01:24:58.630 --> 01:24:58.991
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

3548
01:24:58.991 --> 01:24:59.681
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

3549
01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3550
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:01.510
<v Speaker 4>it translates very well to sports.</v>

3551
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Do you do to Bottas do you ever do tabata bottles are good?</v>

3552
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3553
01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:05.890
<v Speaker 4>I think tomatoes are good.</v>

3554
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:06.890
<v Speaker 4>If they're done well,</v>

3555
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.511
<v Speaker 4>they're good.</v>

3556
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:07.811
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3557
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:10.690
<v Speaker 4>you have to do it in a way it doesn't create soreness cause Tabata can create</v>

3558
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:11.081
<v Speaker 4>soreness.</v>

3559
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:11.531
<v Speaker 4>You have to be very,</v>

3560
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do Tabata Kettlebell swing,</v>

3561
01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:13.570
<v Speaker 4>that'll,</v>

3562
01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:14.530
<v Speaker 4>that'll cook my,</v>

3563
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.693
<v Speaker 4>my hamstrings.</v>

3564
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll probably do like hurdle jump.</v>

3565
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Like you take a small hurdle hurdle over it for 20 seconds.</v>

3566
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.011
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

3567
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:22.180
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying though,</v>

3568
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 4>like there's gotta be a bunch of crossfit people out there right now that a</v>

3569
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:25.990
<v Speaker 4>screaming into their phones,</v>

3570
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.650
<v Speaker 4>they're wrong.</v>

3571
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:27.483
<v Speaker 4>All the respect,</v>

3572
01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:28.620
<v Speaker 4>the wrong.</v>

3573
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I can say all due respect with all the respect,</v>

3574
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:31.071
<v Speaker 4>the wrong.</v>

3575
01:25:31.071 --> 01:25:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you why.</v>

3576
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3577
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:32.860
<v Speaker 4>And then look,</v>

3578
01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.611
<v Speaker 4>if you like crossfit,</v>

3579
01:25:33.611 --> 01:25:34.960
<v Speaker 4>do with whatever motivates you to do it.</v>

3580
01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:35.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3581
01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.510
<v Speaker 4>cross its problem is it's fatigue seeking.</v>

3582
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3583
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:39.401
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

3584
01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:39.551
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3585
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 4>go out there and burn yourself out.</v>

3586
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:41.890
<v Speaker 4>That's totally wrong.</v>

3587
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 4>They're not building any skill.</v>

3588
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Try to show me a guy who a champion of crossfit champion and digital they got</v>

3589
01:25:48.541 --> 01:25:49.820
<v Speaker 4>would need two lifetimes to read.</v>

3590
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Which mastery in both of those.</v>

3591
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:52.413
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3592
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Because my crossfit workout is going to tax me so much.</v>

3593
01:25:55.031 --> 01:25:56.470
<v Speaker 4>I cannot learn armbar sweep,</v>

3594
01:25:56.471 --> 01:25:57.304
<v Speaker 4>triangle choke,</v>

3595
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:57.701
<v Speaker 4>double leg,</v>

3596
01:25:57.701 --> 01:26:00.550
<v Speaker 4>take down under hook might have tax my whole system.</v>

3597
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.990
<v Speaker 4>My system is in recovery.</v>

3598
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.410
<v Speaker 4>When your systems in recovery,</v>

3599
01:26:03.411 --> 01:26:04.244
<v Speaker 4>what can you do</v>

3600
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.080
<v Speaker 5>but rest in the sun.</v>

3601
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.771
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3602
01:26:06.771 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 5>Half a Mendez.</v>

3603
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Do you think half a Mendez,</v>

3604
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:08.781
<v Speaker 5>one of the,</v>

3605
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 5>arguably the greatest pound for pound,</v>

3606
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:11.720
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest profit pounds Jiu Jitsu guys in the world.</v>

3607
01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he's got a great,</v>

3608
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:13.743
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3609
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 5>a crossfit workout that he's really mastered?</v>

3610
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:16.251
<v Speaker 5>He's really good.</v>

3611
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 5>I do think it has a great back squat.</v>

3612
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he's a great dead lifter?</v>

3613
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't look like it.</v>

3614
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:19.881
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3615
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:20.714
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't believe me.</v>

3616
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:21.700
<v Speaker 5>You think we think,</v>

3617
01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3618
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:22.880
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3619
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.571
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Ryan,</v>

3620
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:24.351
<v Speaker 5>he's a great,</v>

3621
01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:24.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3622
01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:25.360
<v Speaker 5>Olympic lifter.</v>

3623
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:25.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3624
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:25.821
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3625
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3626
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:26.430
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

3627
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:28.280
<v Speaker 5>they're always going to be at an amateur level.</v>

3628
01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 5>And that in the fitness world,</v>

3629
01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:30.021
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3630
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Because if they were experts,</v>

3631
01:26:31.731 --> 01:26:33.260
<v Speaker 5>they would have taken so much from,</v>

3632
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:34.094
<v Speaker 5>there's Jujitsu,</v>

3633
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:34.631
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3634
01:26:34.631 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 5>look at Georgia.</v>

3635
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 5>Does gymnastics.</v>

3636
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:36.141
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3637
01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:36.201
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3638
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 5>and I'm the one who quite twisted his arm a little to put them in gymnastics.</v>

3639
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:39.940
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3640
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3641
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:40.881
<v Speaker 5>because I thought it would,</v>

3642
01:26:40.881 --> 01:26:42.470
<v Speaker 5>it would give them a tremendous benefit because,</v>

3643
01:26:42.471 --> 01:26:42.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3644
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:43.051
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

3645
01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3646
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.180
<v Speaker 5>the amount of,</v>

3647
01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:44.600
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3648
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 5>they use a lot of body weight,</v>

3649
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:48.350
<v Speaker 5>so it doesn't cost us anything neurologically.</v>

3650
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Bodyweight exercises are very easy to recover from.</v>

3651
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:57.050
<v Speaker 5>Bodyweight exercises are very easy on the nervous system.</v>

3652
01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.360
<v Speaker 5>They use leverage instead of weights plus the stabilizers.</v>

3653
01:27:01.361 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 5>Strength is unbelievable.</v>

3654
01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.910
<v Speaker 5>So of course I want a coordination.</v>

3655
01:27:04.911 --> 01:27:06.130
<v Speaker 5>I felt George was a little bit stiff,</v>

3656
01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 5>mechanical and the tumbling makes you more fluid.</v>

3657
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I think I,</v>

3658
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 5>I thought it would create more efficiency this way.</v>

3659
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:15.350
<v Speaker 5>So we get them there and there's,</v>

3660
01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:16.250
<v Speaker 5>there's difficulties.</v>

3661
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:16.401
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3662
01:27:16.401 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 5>From eight to F,</v>

3663
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 5>we're still at a and B and he'll always be at a,</v>

3664
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:21.321
<v Speaker 5>and B,</v>

3665
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:21.981
<v Speaker 5>maybe he'll touch,</v>

3666
01:27:21.981 --> 01:27:22.850
<v Speaker 5>see it in his career,</v>

3667
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 5>but he'll never get to f.</v>

3668
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:27.620
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to start really young and you'd have to do it full time.</v>

3669
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.371
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3670
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:30.740
<v Speaker 5>imagine somebody trying to get good at Jujitsu,</v>

3671
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:31.371
<v Speaker 5>doing it part time.</v>

3672
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:32.150
<v Speaker 5>He'll never get good.</v>

3673
01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:32.421
<v Speaker 5>He'll do,</v>

3674
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:32.871
<v Speaker 5>he'll be so,</v>

3675
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 5>so he'll reach such a level.</v>

3676
01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 5>Crossfit is to fatigue seeking for an MMA fighter.</v>

3677
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.970
<v Speaker 5>Now if crossfitters followed,</v>

3678
01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:41.661
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3679
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:41.991
<v Speaker 5>if the,</v>

3680
01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 5>if they just follow that 70% rule,</v>

3681
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 5>they can periodically went to their max periodically as opposed to every single</v>

3682
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:48.800
<v Speaker 5>workout.</v>

3683
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.730
<v Speaker 5>Go total the out.</v>

3684
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 5>I bet you their top top guys don't go all out every day.</v>

3685
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:54.321
<v Speaker 5>I bet you a few.</v>

3686
01:27:54.321 --> 01:27:55.430
<v Speaker 5>If you watch with their top guys,</v>

3687
01:27:55.431 --> 01:27:59.270
<v Speaker 5>do they taper off the work that they make the workout between 70 and 85% of</v>

3688
01:27:59.271 --> 01:28:03.470
<v Speaker 5>their true Max and they work volume and then closer to competition,</v>

3689
01:28:03.471 --> 01:28:04.580
<v Speaker 5>they go hire an intensity.</v>

3690
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:06.350
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that's what the best crossfitters do.</v>

3691
01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 5>There's no way that the guy who goes balls out every day is going to add up as</v>

3692
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:13.730
<v Speaker 5>much workout and as much training time as the guy who was going 70 to 85% of his</v>

3693
01:28:13.731 --> 01:28:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Max.</v>

3694
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.923
<v Speaker 5>There's just no way.</v>

3695
01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 5>But when they do those classes,</v>

3696
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 5>like say they do a crossfit class,</v>

3697
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:19.700
<v Speaker 5>and I'm speaking out of ignorance,</v>

3698
01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:20.121
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

3699
01:28:20.121 --> 01:28:21.530
<v Speaker 5>because I only watch them on video.</v>

3700
01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 5>I've never done it across the class,</v>

3701
01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:24.860
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to me they're competing against each other.</v>

3702
01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3703
01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 5>they're going all out trying to set a PR every class.</v>

3704
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3705
01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:28.850
<v Speaker 5>that's ridiculous.</v>

3706
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:29.481
<v Speaker 5>All the respect.</v>

3707
01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:30.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>

3708
01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make any sense,</v>

3709
01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:33.170
<v Speaker 5>but why is it so popular?</v>

3710
01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Because people think that's right because why?</v>

3711
01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Because when you watch a prime time or a fight,</v>

3712
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:38.840
<v Speaker 5>the guys at the peak,</v>

3713
01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:39.630
<v Speaker 5>he's going at the,</v>

3714
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:41.050
<v Speaker 5>he's at a point in his career in his foot,</v>

3715
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 5>in his training camp where he's at the high end of intensity,</v>

3716
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:47.090
<v Speaker 5>so people are always watching the last part of your camp,</v>

3717
01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.720
<v Speaker 5>the part where you're peaking and then you're going to go taper off or 10 15</v>

3718
01:28:50.721 --> 01:28:51.554
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

3719
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 5>They don't see that part and they don't see the month before where you ramped up</v>

3720
01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:55.364
<v Speaker 5>to that level.</v>

3721
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:56.930
<v Speaker 5>They just see the last two,</v>

3722
01:28:56.931 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 5>three weeks where it's the last few sparrings and we're mimicking fight speed to</v>

3723
01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 5>the maximum as we can.</v>

3724
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 4>We're fruiting with danger here.</v>

3725
01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 4>We're only doing it a little bit,</v>

3726
01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:06.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's the part everybody's watching,</v>

3727
01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 4>so they think,</v>

3728
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3729
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:08.850
<v Speaker 4>if you want to become a really good,</v>

3730
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.680
<v Speaker 4>you have to flirt with danger every day.</v>

3731
01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.910
<v Speaker 4>If that's what their workouts are.</v>

3732
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.620
<v Speaker 4>If you see George train throughout the year,</v>

3733
01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:13.891
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

3734
01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:14.011
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3735
01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't so intense.</v>

3736
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.320
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't so intense.</v>

3737
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:18.090
<v Speaker 4>There's another really mellow practice.</v>

3738
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.411
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was younger,</v>

3739
01:29:19.411 --> 01:29:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I was training at the ground brothers,</v>

3740
01:29:20.461 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Jim and I would see Otis grant,</v>

3741
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:22.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3742
01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:23.400
<v Speaker 4>he's a world champion boxer.</v>

3743
01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:26.430
<v Speaker 4>He says everybody knew him in Canada because he's a man and he was training</v>

3744
01:29:26.431 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 4>really relaxed and I was like,</v>

3745
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:28.051
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3746
01:29:28.051 --> 01:29:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm training harder than him.</v>

3747
01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 4>But he's,</v>

3748
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 4>that's his millionth workout.</v>

3749
01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:32.730
<v Speaker 4>There was my 10th you know,</v>

3750
01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:34.110
<v Speaker 4>he's doing in the long run,</v>

3751
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 4>he's added way more years of training.</v>

3752
01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 4>So that's when I started to understand that the champion,</v>

3753
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.693
<v Speaker 4>the best guy,</v>

3754
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.040
<v Speaker 4>he's training for the long run.</v>

3755
01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:41.970
<v Speaker 4>It's far more intelligent.</v>

3756
01:29:41.971 --> 01:29:45.570
<v Speaker 4>He's getting far more workouts in than me that's burned out in the next day.</v>

3757
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:46.280
<v Speaker 4>I need a rest.</v>

3758
01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:46.940
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3759
01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3760
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

3761
01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:49.440
<v Speaker 4>it's consistency over intensity.</v>

3762
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:53.130
<v Speaker 4>Intensity entails you need to take a break because there's no way around it.</v>

3763
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a young person listening to this and you're got a coach that's</v>

3764
01:29:57.841 --> 01:29:59.370
<v Speaker 4>trying to burn you out every day,</v>

3765
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.713
<v Speaker 4>the fuck do you do?</v>

3766
01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:02.643
<v Speaker 4>I'm</v>

3767
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.240
<v Speaker 4>going to the gym and go,</v>

3768
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:06.960
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3769
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.880
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to frost the hobby the other day.</v>

3770
01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:09.691
<v Speaker 4>And for us saying,</v>

3771
01:30:09.691 --> 01:30:10.524
<v Speaker 4>you're a retard.</v>

3772
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Here's my,</v>

3773
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:13.711
<v Speaker 4>here's my,</v>

3774
01:30:13.711 --> 01:30:14.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3775
01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:14.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3776
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:15.103
<v Speaker 4>when I roll with the guys,</v>

3777
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.530
<v Speaker 4>I think they feel when I grabbed them,</v>

3778
01:30:16.531 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm grabbing them gently and they realize it and I'll let them,</v>

3779
01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:20.010
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3780
01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I like guys pass my guard.</v>

3781
01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll just go ahead and start second tool and I'll just get,</v>

3782
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 4>they'll get the message that we're just kinda playing around.</v>

3783
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3784
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:29.700
<v Speaker 4>And then later when we were going more intense,</v>

3785
01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3786
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:31.080
<v Speaker 4>they'll feel it,</v>

3787
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 4>they'll feel the intensity.</v>

3788
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 4>But I don't always roll heart.</v>

3789
01:30:34.230 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Like if you see me rolling,</v>

3790
01:30:35.551 --> 01:30:37.580
<v Speaker 4>like I usually will roll with blue belts and pro ball swipe.</v>

3791
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Does there need to warm up?</v>

3792
01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:39.031
<v Speaker 4>I need three,</v>

3793
01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:39.980
<v Speaker 4>four rounds of warmup,</v>

3794
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3795
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to even have a tight shoulder or tight hamstring.</v>

3796
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't want anything type of course.</v>

3797
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:49.020
<v Speaker 4>So I warm up with them.</v>

3798
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:49.441
<v Speaker 4>Really good one.</v>

3799
01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm really warm.</v>

3800
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.510
<v Speaker 4>Then I go in at a wrestle,</v>

3801
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.741
<v Speaker 4>I like to go rest.</v>

3802
01:30:52.741 --> 01:30:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I extend,</v>

3803
01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:53.731
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3804
01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:54.331
<v Speaker 4>who wants to wrestle?</v>

3805
01:30:54.331 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 4>Know what's cool because I'm really warm than I can wrestle.</v>

3806
01:30:56.791 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 4>I could hit the ground well,</v>

3807
01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 4>but you're in a position where you can sort of determine and dictate what kind</v>

3808
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:02.970
<v Speaker 4>of exercises you do.</v>

3809
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3810
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 4>But if you were,</v>

3811
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 4>the question was like if you were a young person and you're entering into an MMA</v>

3812
01:31:07.951 --> 01:31:10.050
<v Speaker 4>gym and the instructor,</v>

3813
01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:12.210
<v Speaker 4>those to be kind is a meathead,</v>

3814
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.051
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3815
01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Which there's a lot of them out there.</v>

3816
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:14.960
<v Speaker 4>There is,</v>

3817
01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3818
01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:16.431
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

3819
01:31:16.431 --> 01:31:17.264
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

3820
01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:17.680
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

3821
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 4>you might have to take a few beatings as white belt,</v>

3822
01:31:20.370 --> 01:31:20.830
<v Speaker 4>you might like,</v>

3823
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:21.241
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3824
01:31:21.241 --> 01:31:22.710
<v Speaker 4>I grind my gears when I was younger,</v>

3825
01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:26.790
<v Speaker 4>but as you get older and more skilled now you can take the VIP lane,</v>

3826
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:27.271
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3827
01:31:27.271 --> 01:31:27.811
<v Speaker 4>now's the time,</v>

3828
01:31:27.811 --> 01:31:29.640
<v Speaker 4>you've got the skill and you've got the knowledge,</v>

3829
01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:31.680
<v Speaker 4>but early on you have less miles on you,</v>

3830
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:31.950
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

3831
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:32.850
<v Speaker 4>you'll survive more,</v>

3832
01:31:32.851 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 4>more of a beating.</v>

3833
01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.231
<v Speaker 4>You ever see those?</v>

3834
01:31:34.231 --> 01:31:38.490
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of Jujitsu classes where they go through an extremely rigorous</v>

3835
01:31:38.491 --> 01:31:41.610
<v Speaker 4>conditioning routine before they ever do any training.</v>

3836
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 4>And I've always disagreed with that and I agree totally.</v>

3837
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3838
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:45.901
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3839
01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:48.090
<v Speaker 4>I feel like show me one world champion that did it that way.</v>

3840
01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:48.930
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3841
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

3842
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

3843
01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's possible that they did.</v>

3844
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>

3845
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3846
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who did what.</v>

3847
01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:59.271
<v Speaker 4>I've trained with a lot of the greatest Jujitsu guys in the world and they're</v>

3848
01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 4>all warm up a technique.</v>

3849
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3850
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:03.990
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>

3851
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:06.420
<v Speaker 4>Do you think Ryan Hall gets up and does the burpees before practice?</v>

3852
01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.011
<v Speaker 4>You think he goes in,</v>

3853
01:32:07.011 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 4>he runs five miles and he does weights.</v>

3854
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:12.460
<v Speaker 4>I know that like a lot of the old school guys,</v>

3855
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:13.181
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

3856
01:32:13.181 --> 01:32:14.480
<v Speaker 4>they were into that like a,</v>

3857

3861
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.121
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3862
01:32:19.121 --> 01:32:20.020

3863
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:21.511
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

3866
01:32:21.511 --> 01:32:23.830
<v Speaker 4>he was in a time and place where very few people knew Jujitsu.</v>

3867
01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Right now we're in where the secret's out.</v>

3868
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:27.641
<v Speaker 4>Who are the top guys?</v>

3869
01:32:27.641 --> 01:32:28.474
<v Speaker 4>What are they doing?</v>

3870
01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:29.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3871
01:32:29.381 --> 01:32:33.070
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's also a thing where people want to be really tired from</v>

3872
01:32:33.071 --> 01:32:33.700
<v Speaker 4>workouts.</v>

3873
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 4>They feel like they're getting a great workout in if you beat them down.</v>

3874
01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3875
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:39.693
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>

3876
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.091
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3877
01:32:40.091 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

3878
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.411
<v Speaker 4>there's a debt,</v>

3879
01:32:41.411 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 4>a disconnect.</v>

3880
01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:42.820
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

3881
01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.600
<v Speaker 4>I want to feel paid,</v>

3882
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 4>punish me.</v>

3883
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:44.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3884
01:32:44.441 --> 01:32:46.960
<v Speaker 4>You're your retarding growth though.</v>

3885
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.750
<v Speaker 4>You know like people don't like that word retard anymore but because you know</v>

3886
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.090
<v Speaker 4>they think you're talking about someone with a disease but the,</v>

3887
01:32:53.091 --> 01:32:57.460
<v Speaker 4>the real term of being of retarding you are,</v>

3888
01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:02.510
<v Speaker 4>you're slowing down growth and that's really what retarded action is.</v>

3889
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:04.651
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>

3890
01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:04.921
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3891
01:33:04.921 --> 01:33:09.921
<v Speaker 4>you have an issue in that the way you're approaching things is uniquely damaging</v>

3892
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 4>to your ultimate goal of progress.</v>

3893
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:15.453
<v Speaker 4>And I agree.</v>

3894
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 4>It's so common.</v>

3895
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:19.960
<v Speaker 4>If someone right now is listening,</v>

3896
01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:21.940
<v Speaker 4>he is mine.</v>

3897
01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:24.880
<v Speaker 4>It's blog is my better going to class and they know that they're going to happen</v>

3898
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:29.320
<v Speaker 4>to all these crazy burpees and all this crazy shit before class.</v>

3899
01:33:29.321 --> 01:33:30.610
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking comment.</v>

3900
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:31.743
<v Speaker 4>ICARUS,</v>

3901
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:33.130
<v Speaker 4>you flight to close to the sun.</v>

3902
01:33:33.131 --> 01:33:33.860

3903
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.890
<v Speaker 4>You get burned by this.</v>

3904
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.290
<v Speaker 4>His stay in the middle there in the middle.</v>

3905
01:33:38.291 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 4>If you get to do those conditioning exercises kind of half asam halfass and a</v>

3906
01:33:41.501 --> 01:33:41.770
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

3907
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:42.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3908
01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:42.930
<v Speaker 4>you permission.</v>

3909
01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:43.763
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like,</v>

3910
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.460
<v Speaker 4>I like to make conditioning after.</v>

3911
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:46.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3912
01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Because my body is warm and I don't need,</v>

3913
01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:49.751
<v Speaker 4>cause the thing is look,</v>

3914
01:33:49.751 --> 01:33:51.100
<v Speaker 4>when you do conditioning,</v>

3915
01:33:51.101 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 4>before you weaken your stabilizers,</v>

3916
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.553
<v Speaker 4>the prime mover,</v>

3917
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 4>the Ma,</v>

3918
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:57.400
<v Speaker 4>the muscles in your body that are prime movers have more interest than your</v>

3919
01:33:57.401 --> 01:33:58.234
<v Speaker 4>stabilizers.</v>

3920
01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 4>So few weekend the stabilizers,</v>

3921
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 4>your joint is less stable while you're rolling.</v>

3922
01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:03.363
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3923
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:06.640
<v Speaker 4>The element of fatigue can put your joints in danger.</v>

3924
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:09.190
<v Speaker 4>That's why I only do cause when you're,</v>

3925
01:34:09.191 --> 01:34:09.491
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>

3926
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.420
<v Speaker 4>when you're doing exercises,</v>

3927
01:34:10.421 --> 01:34:10.991
<v Speaker 4>you're in control.</v>

3928
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:13.270
<v Speaker 4>You're not in a live role with somebody trying to tug on your arm.</v>

3929
01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:13.691
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3930
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:16.630
<v Speaker 4>So I need maximum strength when somebody is trying to tug on my arm in case I'm</v>

3931
01:34:16.631 --> 01:34:17.464
<v Speaker 4>in a bad position,</v>

3932
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.701
<v Speaker 4>I need to make sure that I have,</v>

3933
01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 4>my strength levels are there to protect my joints.</v>

3934
01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Joint protect.</v>

3935
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Joint protection is huge.</v>

3936
01:34:23.201 --> 01:34:24.670
<v Speaker 4>You need to make sure your joints are healthy.</v>

3937
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:25.420
<v Speaker 4>It's huge.</v>

3938
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.000
<v Speaker 4>What what,</v>

3939
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 4>what kind of exercises do you do to make sure your joints are protected?</v>

3940
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.670
<v Speaker 4>Well I do the supple leopard,</v>

3941
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of mobility work and I do low impact plyometrics,</v>

3942
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:36.663
<v Speaker 4>low impact.</v>

3943
01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:36.851
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3944
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:37.241
<v Speaker 4>for instance,</v>

3945
01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:38.051
<v Speaker 4>that's why I like the Med ball.</v>

3946
01:34:38.051 --> 01:34:39.280
<v Speaker 4>Throwing the Med ball against the wall.</v>

3947
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I like to do steps.</v>

3948
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:41.890
<v Speaker 4>You know like you have a block,</v>

3949
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 4>like a 12 inch block and like to jump,</v>

3950
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:46.270
<v Speaker 4>like do steps over a back and forth.</v>

3951
01:34:46.271 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 4>So you kind of jumped up in the air,</v>

3952
01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.390
<v Speaker 4>but she never leave the ground because the block is also high.</v>

3953
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:51.460
<v Speaker 4>So you never get the negative contraction.</v>

3954
01:34:51.461 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 4>You never get the impact of hitting the ground.</v>

3955
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Alec sprinting.</v>

3956
01:34:54.191 --> 01:34:54.631
<v Speaker 4>I like club.</v>

3957
01:34:54.631 --> 01:34:55.271
<v Speaker 4>Explain that.</v>

3958
01:34:55.271 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 4>How do you not getting the negative?</v>

3959
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 4>So let's say for instance there's,</v>

3960
01:34:58.971 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 4>this is a block and this is my feet right here,</v>

3961
01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:01.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3962
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.300
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like this,</v>

3963
01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll jump like I saw,</v>

3964
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:04.664
<v Speaker 4>I'll jump.</v>

3965
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:06.591
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3966
01:35:06.591 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 4>so you touched the block.</v>

3967
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 4>I've touching the block so I'm never,</v>

3968
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

3969
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:10.400
<v Speaker 4>when I jumped off the ground,</v>

3970
01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm landing on the block so I'm always,</v>

3971
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:14.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm stepping down,</v>

3972
01:35:14.151 --> 01:35:14.870
<v Speaker 4>jumping up,</v>

3973
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:15.531
<v Speaker 4>stepping down,</v>

3974
01:35:15.531 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 4>jumping up.</v>

3975
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:16.700
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>

3976
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:21.550
<v Speaker 4>so I'm always exploding up but landing on a block softly because it's,</v>

3977
01:35:21.551 --> 01:35:22.790
<v Speaker 4>it's when you jump up,</v>

3978
01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 4>it's the landing that kills your joints.</v>

3979
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 4>If I put up a a 50 inch box,</v>

3980
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:26.641
<v Speaker 4>Emma,</v>

3981
01:35:26.641 --> 01:35:29.120
<v Speaker 4>you jump up the landings in be very soft.</v>

3982
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.680
<v Speaker 4>If I tell you jump over a hurdle now you're in midair and you're crushing down</v>

3983
01:35:33.681 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 4>towards the ground and you land,</v>

3984
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.590
<v Speaker 4>you got to absorb that shock.</v>

3985
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.020
<v Speaker 4>But that's why I like like hill sprints.</v>

3986
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:41.360
<v Speaker 4>Hill sprints are great because your foot never leaves the ground even though</v>

3987
01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:44.120
<v Speaker 4>you're exploding upwards that the ground is coming up with you.</v>

3988
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very soft landing.</v>

3989
01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 4>The soft landing is key.</v>

3990
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3991
01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:49.531
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3992
01:35:49.531 --> 01:35:50.600
<v Speaker 4>that makes a lot of sense.</v>

3993
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:52.070
<v Speaker 4>That makes a lot of sense.</v>

3994
01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.530
<v Speaker 4>But what about hitting bag then?</v>

3995
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.191
<v Speaker 4>It's the best.</v>

3996
01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:55.881
<v Speaker 4>Cardio is the best.</v>

3997
01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of Dutch Joe for cardio.</v>

3998
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 4>Dutch drills with Israel.</v>

3999
01:35:59.150 --> 01:35:59.501
<v Speaker 4>Left Hook,</v>

4000
01:35:59.501 --> 01:35:59.701
<v Speaker 4>cry,</v>

4001
01:35:59.701 --> 01:35:59.961
<v Speaker 4>kick,</v>

4002
01:35:59.961 --> 01:36:00.291
<v Speaker 4>right hand,</v>

4003
01:36:00.291 --> 01:36:00.890
<v Speaker 4>left kick,</v>

4004
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:01.521
<v Speaker 4>three minutes,</v>

4005
01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:02.261
<v Speaker 4>just bad bup,</v>

4006
01:36:02.261 --> 01:36:02.530
<v Speaker 4>bup,</v>

4007
01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:02.750
<v Speaker 4>bup,</v>

4008
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:03.583
<v Speaker 4>bup home.</v>

4009
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:06.380
<v Speaker 4>Somebody they do three punch combo to punch Combo and it finished with a</v>

4010
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:09.820
<v Speaker 4>kickboard double kick and I just spiked my heart rate that way.</v>

4011
01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm developing my skill,</v>

4012
01:36:10.941 --> 01:36:11.780
<v Speaker 4>developing my cardio.</v>

4013
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:14.580
<v Speaker 4>I get very lean when I do that and uh,</v>

4014
01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:15.231
<v Speaker 4>I feel great.</v>

4015
01:36:15.231 --> 01:36:18.170
<v Speaker 4>I feel my energy levels are up and say it's better than doing bike or running</v>

4016
01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 4>personally cause I'm developing my skill and I'm also spiking my heart rate.</v>

4017
01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:23.930
<v Speaker 4>A dage drill can be very intense on the heart rate.</v>

4018
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:25.760
<v Speaker 4>It's low impact and it's a plow metrics.</v>

4019
01:36:25.761 --> 01:36:26.594
<v Speaker 4>Everything I need.</v>

4020
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:27.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4021
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:28.191
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

4022
01:36:28.191 --> 01:36:28.551
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

4023
01:36:28.551 --> 01:36:30.380
<v Speaker 4>What wait heavy bag do you use?</v>

4024
01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.610
<v Speaker 4>I use the fair text.</v>

4025
01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.780
<v Speaker 4>The giant pole bag,</v>

4026
01:36:32.781 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 4>they call it like a big,</v>

4027
01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 4>big giant bag of touches the ground.</v>

4028
01:36:36.261 --> 01:36:37.310
<v Speaker 4>So when I kick it it doesn't move.</v>

4029
01:36:37.311 --> 01:36:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Father's heavy as fuck.</v>

4030
01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like a 300 pound bag,</v>

4031
01:36:39.981 --> 01:36:40.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4032
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4033
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:41.743
<v Speaker 4>Why do you like that one?</v>

4034
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Because when it kick it,</v>

4035
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:47.150
<v Speaker 4>the bag doesn't swing so I don't have to reset so I can keep that pace really</v>

4036
01:36:47.151 --> 01:36:47.510
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>

4037
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:48.071
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going pop,</v>

4038
01:36:48.071 --> 01:36:48.260
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4039
01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:48.490
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4040
01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:48.701
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4041
01:36:48.701 --> 01:36:48.860
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4042
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:49.120
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4043
01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:49.331
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4044
01:36:49.331 --> 01:36:49.491
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4045
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:49.730
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

4046
01:36:49.730 --> 01:36:49.971
<v Speaker 4>pop.</v>

4047
01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:52.560
<v Speaker 4>I know you're hitting it full blast or you just saw them.</v>

4048
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.391
<v Speaker 4>As I get warmed up,</v>

4049
01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 4>I hit harder and harder til I'm full blast so I might start really relaxed,</v>

4050
01:36:56.961 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 4>kicking low to the leg.</v>

4051
01:36:57.861 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Then as the work gets warmer and warmer and hotter and hotter,</v>

4052
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm sweating my start kicking to the head.</v>

4053
01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

4054
01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 4>Everything is gradual warmup,</v>

4055
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.781
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4056
01:37:05.781 --> 01:37:06.501
<v Speaker 4>And when I've had enough,</v>

4057
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I stopped like I'm not gonna make myself sick because I'm working out tomorrow</v>

4058
01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.840
<v Speaker 4>again right now.</v>

4059
01:37:11.841 --> 01:37:13.220
<v Speaker 4>What about stretching?</v>

4060
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:14.331
<v Speaker 4>Stretching,</v>

4061
01:37:14.331 --> 01:37:14.721
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

4062
01:37:14.721 --> 01:37:15.830
<v Speaker 4>but I prefer mobility.</v>

4063
01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>So mobility is the element of stretching your muscle,</v>

4064
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:19.040
<v Speaker 4>but also creating motion.</v>

4065
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:22.730
<v Speaker 4>The joint has to be in a type of rotation in the route.</v>

4066
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.631
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4067
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 4>Because you're creating Sylvan synovial fluid to the joint.</v>

4068
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:29.150
<v Speaker 4>The joint is really more important to me than the muscle because the muscle</v>

4069
01:37:29.151 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 4>rejuvenates itself.</v>

4070
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:31.543
<v Speaker 4>The joint doesn't,</v>

4071
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 4>it does let us lesser degree,</v>

4072
01:37:33.171 --> 01:37:34.850
<v Speaker 4>so I got to always be oiling up the joints.</v>

4073
01:37:34.851 --> 01:37:35.780
<v Speaker 4>This is very important to me.</v>

4074
01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.393
<v Speaker 4>Very important.</v>

4075
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Now when you say like mobility,</v>

4076
01:37:39.291 --> 01:37:42.140
<v Speaker 4>like what do you do like for your hamstrings and things like that?</v>

4077
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:45.260
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to stretch them out and also do mobility.</v>

4078
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:46.880
<v Speaker 4>So let's say I stretch out my leg,</v>

4079
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I'll be just kind of bending at the hit in and out.</v>

4080
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:52.040
<v Speaker 4>I won't just leave it out there static.</v>

4081
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 4>There has to be a type of motion.</v>

4082
01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 4>I said it's very important because when I'm wrestling or I'm doing Jiu Jitsu,</v>

4083
01:37:56.731 --> 01:37:58.080
<v Speaker 4>my legs out there and I'm creating motion,</v>

4084
01:37:58.081 --> 01:37:58.561
<v Speaker 4>I have to move.</v>

4085
01:37:58.561 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just putting it out there.</v>

4086
01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4087
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 4>There's always a type of movement because when I stretch my leg out to stop you</v>

4088
01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:04.561
<v Speaker 4>from passing the guard,</v>

4089
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be moving my body at the same time.</v>

4090
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.661
<v Speaker 4>So that's mobility.</v>

4091
01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:07.021
<v Speaker 4>It's different.</v>

4092
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Some stretching,</v>

4093
01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.190
<v Speaker 4>mobility.</v>

4094
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 4>There is a stretch element and mobility,</v>

4095
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:10.711
<v Speaker 4>but it's stretching.</v>

4096
01:38:10.711 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 4>There's no mobility element.</v>

4097
01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 4>Now what about yoga?</v>

4098
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 4>I think yoga is good for relaxation and the range of motion.</v>

4099
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:19.020
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very good.</v>

4100
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 4>I just don't personally have the time and energy for it because I'm always in</v>

4101
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:21.901
<v Speaker 4>the gym.</v>

4102
01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:23.220
<v Speaker 4>So for me to find time for yoga,</v>

4103
01:38:23.221 --> 01:38:24.180
<v Speaker 4>it's just a little bit difficult,</v>

4104
01:38:24.181 --> 01:38:28.080
<v Speaker 4>but I think it does allow for a great range of motion and relaxation and</v>

4105
01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:28.621
<v Speaker 4>centering.</v>

4106
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 4>If you have the time in your schedule.</v>

4107
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:30.684
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

4108
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I just personally with three kids and then my,</v>

4109
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:34.021
<v Speaker 4>everything that I do,</v>

4110
01:38:34.021 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

4111
01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the gym already too much.</v>

4112
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4113
01:38:36.450 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4114
01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.613
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4115
01:38:37.650 --> 01:38:37.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4116
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:39.930
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder like for fighters,</v>

4117
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm hearing more and more fighters incorporate yoga into the training</v>

4118
01:38:43.801 --> 01:38:46.410
<v Speaker 4>sessions to just try to create more balance and,</v>

4119
01:38:46.710 --> 01:38:48.150
<v Speaker 4>and also stability,</v>

4120
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.990
<v Speaker 4>joint stability in particular because you're holding these static positions for</v>

4121
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:54.380
<v Speaker 4>long periods of time valance and,</v>

4122
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:55.440
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4123
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.390
<v Speaker 4>and it's a brilliant art your core as well.</v>

4124
01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:57.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4125
01:38:57.601 --> 01:38:58.434
<v Speaker 4>it's a brilliant art.</v>

4126
01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 4>If you can have the time and energy to do it,</v>

4127
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:01.404
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>

4128
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Now what about nutrition?</v>

4129
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.530
<v Speaker 4>Nutrition is huge.</v>

4130
01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

4131
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:06.263
<v Speaker 4>how do you eat?</v>

4132
01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4133
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.680
<v Speaker 4>right now I just finished Ramadan so I've been eating a lot of processed foods.</v>

4134
01:39:10.681 --> 01:39:11.451
<v Speaker 4>I've had like Robin,</v>

4135
01:39:11.451 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Don's like the,</v>

4136
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 4>with the time of the year where I gained a lot of weight because normally</v>

4137
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:16.680
<v Speaker 4>throughout the year I ate very little processed foods.</v>

4138
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 4>I eat natural foods.</v>

4139
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.141
<v Speaker 4>But during Ramadan,</v>

4140
01:39:19.141 --> 01:39:20.730
<v Speaker 4>because I was such a small window to eat,</v>

4141
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.370
<v Speaker 4>to fit my calories in and I'm very busy all year round,</v>

4142
01:39:23.410 --> 01:39:23.911
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>

4143
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm always have projects so we're not fights traveling.</v>

4144
01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I eat processed foods when I eat processed foods out.</v>

4145
01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:29.694
<v Speaker 4>Why process?</v>

4146
01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Because there's more calories in them.</v>

4147
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:31.860
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4148
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.250
<v Speaker 4>if I got,</v>

4149
01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 4>if I got to get my,</v>

4150
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:35.640
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to go the whole day after no water,</v>

4151
01:39:35.641 --> 01:39:36.474
<v Speaker 4>no food,</v>

4152
01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:38.760
<v Speaker 4>I need to have eaten a certain amount of,</v>

4153
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.091
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

4154
01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:39.420
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

4155
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.860
<v Speaker 4>of calories in the night.</v>

4156
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:42.460
<v Speaker 4>So if I eat whole,</v>

4157
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.190
<v Speaker 4>if I eat a salad and then some fruits,</v>

4158
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4159
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:45.563
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be,</v>

4160
01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be at zero byte,</v>

4161
01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:49.770
<v Speaker 4>afternoon ride in a hot gym with a bunch of guys.</v>

4162
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:53.000
<v Speaker 4>We need to drill and work and I'm sweating in the gym just standing there and</v>

4163
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:53.940
<v Speaker 4>haven't even started yet.</v>

4164
01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.391
<v Speaker 4>I'm sweating.</v>

4165
01:39:54.391 --> 01:39:55.081
<v Speaker 4>I got to hold pads.</v>

4166
01:39:55.081 --> 01:39:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I've got to wrestle this guy.</v>

4167
01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.170
<v Speaker 4>This guy needs these positions like I'm,</v>

4168
01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm working and at zero.</v>

4169
01:40:00.241 --> 01:40:01.040
<v Speaker 4>So I need that,</v>

4170
01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:01.830
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4171
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:03.990
<v Speaker 4>that density of foods that I get from,</v>

4172
01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:04.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4173
01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:04.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4174
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:05.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4175
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.091
<v Speaker 4>processed foods.</v>

4176
01:40:06.091 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 4>But if I take a serious loss in energy and,</v>

4177
01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:11.121
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and I get,</v>

4180
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.200
<v Speaker 4>I got to gain weight for sure.</v>

4181
01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:14.034
<v Speaker 4>No doubt about it.</v>

4182
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4183
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Salsas foods is the worst for Ramadan,</v>

4184
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:22.011
<v Speaker 4>for the month in the moment you wake up until the sun goes down.</v>

4185
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:23.220
<v Speaker 4>You can't have any food,</v>

4186
01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 4>any water.</v>

4187
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.031
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4188
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:26.310
<v Speaker 4>From the Sunrise Sunrise.</v>

4189
01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.050
<v Speaker 4>So you wake up before sunrise,</v>

4190
01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4191
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:29.483
<v Speaker 4>You will eat.</v>

4192
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:31.260
<v Speaker 4>Most people do that by the,</v>

4193
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:31.900
<v Speaker 4>by the middle,</v>

4194
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 4>by midway of Ramadan.</v>

4195
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 4>I stopped doing that because I just can't get up anymore.</v>

4196
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:35.603
<v Speaker 4>I just can't wake up.</v>

4197
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.930
<v Speaker 4>My buddy is a bit of a wreck.</v>

4198
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:39.090
<v Speaker 4>So butts from sunrise</v>

4199
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:41.423
<v Speaker 4>to sunset,</v>

4200
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:42.780
<v Speaker 4>you're not consuming anything.</v>

4201
01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.001
<v Speaker 4>No food,</v>

4202
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:45.834
<v Speaker 4>no water.</v>

4203
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.691
<v Speaker 4>If you can have water,</v>

4204
01:40:46.691 --> 01:40:47.131
<v Speaker 4>it will be easy.</v>

4205
01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't people who do water fast,</v>

4206
01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:49.084
<v Speaker 4>I've done waterfowl.</v>

4207
01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:49.831
<v Speaker 4>It's quite easy.</v>

4208
01:40:49.831 --> 01:40:50.491
<v Speaker 4>You have the energy,</v>

4209
01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:51.360
<v Speaker 4>but when you cut the water,</v>

4210
01:40:51.361 --> 01:40:51.680
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4211
01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.513
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

4212
01:40:52.890 --> 01:40:53.591
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a problem.</v>

4213
01:40:53.591 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're in a hot gym and you just sweating standing there.</v>

4214
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:57.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4215
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:57.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4216
01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.750
<v Speaker 4>it's in the summer run nuns in the summer.</v>

4217
01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 4>It's very humid in Canada and it's hot,</v>

4218
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:01.953
<v Speaker 4>very hot.</v>

4219
01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.330
<v Speaker 4>So I have to be very careful and that's why at night,</v>

4220
01:41:04.690 --> 01:41:07.590
<v Speaker 4>even just to resist eating processed foods is too difficult.</v>

4221
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:08.503
<v Speaker 4>You gotta eat.</v>

4222
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 4>So do you have a specific calorie number that you try to hit?</v>

4223
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:13.721
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's going to be rough.</v>

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:05.711
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4284
01:42:05.711 --> 01:42:06.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4285
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I tried to do my routine as usual.</v>

4286
01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 4>The hydrating part's got to be the most difficult.</v>

4287
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:11.230
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be exhausting.</v>

4288
01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4289
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:12.503
<v Speaker 4>It's stuff.</v>

4290
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Some fighters have actually gone through training camps while there are no,</v>

4291
01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:18.041
<v Speaker 4>it'd be like,</v>

4292
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:18.191
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4293
01:42:18.191 --> 01:42:19.024
<v Speaker 4>how much?</v>

4294
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4295
01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.880
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous in my opinion,</v>

4296
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:24.190
<v Speaker 4>and the risky while he won,</v>

4297
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:24.881
<v Speaker 4>he won.</v>

4298
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:25.430
<v Speaker 4>God bless him.</v>

4299
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 4>He's that crazy.</v>

4300
01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.550
<v Speaker 4>I have one of my fighters now.</v>

4301
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:28.330
<v Speaker 4>He was doing Ramadan.</v>

4302
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I was telling him off.</v>

4303
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:29.501
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4304
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:29.771
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

4305
01:42:29.771 --> 01:42:31.440
<v Speaker 4>you can't book a fight that do Ramadan.</v>

4306
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:32.283
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the other,</v>

4307
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:34.540
<v Speaker 4>you guys do your Ramadan after the fight,</v>

4308
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 4>but not during the camp.</v>

4309
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.351
<v Speaker 4>This is too risky.</v>

4310
01:42:36.351 --> 01:42:37.184
<v Speaker 4>It's too dangerous.</v>

4311
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:40.140
<v Speaker 4>He was literally sparked.</v>

4312
01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:40.391
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4313
01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:40.570
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4314
01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:41.800
<v Speaker 4>why you look so flat that he's like,</v>

4315
01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:42.881
<v Speaker 4>I got to confess to you.</v>

4316
01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:43.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4317
01:42:43.061 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

4318
01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:44.441
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing Ramadan?</v>

4319
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:44.651
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

4320
01:42:44.651 --> 01:42:45.484
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4321
01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 4>you either to do Ramadan and cancel your fight or you book your fight.</v>

4322
01:42:49.150 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I used to Ramadan after the two is dangerous.</v>

4323
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:52.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

4324
01:42:52.210 --> 01:42:54.580
<v Speaker 4>the Ramadan is not about putting yourself in danger.</v>

4325
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>Can you do Ramadan anytime you want?</v>

4326
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:57.330
<v Speaker 4>If it,</v>

4327
01:42:57.330 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 4>if it interferes with your work,</v>

4328
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.330
<v Speaker 4>you can do it after when it's convenient.</v>

4329
01:43:02.130 --> 01:43:02.531
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

4330
01:43:02.531 --> 01:43:06.600
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have to do it uniformly w when everyone else is doing no,</v>

4331
01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 4>because he has a fight booked.</v>

4332
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:09.071
<v Speaker 4>It's his career.</v>

4333
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:10.300
<v Speaker 4>That's how I put food on the table.</v>

4334
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 4>So you have an exception here.</v>

4335
01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:12.641
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4336
01:43:12.641 --> 01:43:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Do you Ramadan after your fight?</v>

4337
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Like for instance,</v>

4338
01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] mirrors that big tech.</v>

4339
01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.680
<v Speaker 4>He's doing his Ramadan after he just fought.</v>

4340
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:19.120
<v Speaker 4>He's doing it afterwards.</v>

4341
01:43:19.121 --> 01:43:19.331
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4342
01:43:19.331 --> 01:43:20.270
<v Speaker 4>Because during the cattle I was like,</v>

4343
01:43:20.271 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4344
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:24.630
<v Speaker 4>you're either doing Ramadan right and we're canceling the fight or you're going</v>

4345
01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:25.300
<v Speaker 4>to take your,</v>

4346
01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:25.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4347
01:43:25.601 --> 01:43:27.010
<v Speaker 4>you need to do your job and you do ramen.</v>

4348
01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:27.371
<v Speaker 4>Then after,</v>

4349
01:43:27.371 --> 01:43:27.791
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>

4350
01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:28.170
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4351
01:43:28.170 --> 01:43:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I understand that's the way it's done.</v>

4352
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4353
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.820
<v Speaker 4>he looked fantastic.</v>

4354
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Did against the good jobs.</v>

4355
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:32.321
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4356
01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:35.480
<v Speaker 4>it's just my mama's rather lamas is a,</v>

4357
01:43:35.481 --> 01:43:37.090
<v Speaker 4>a very tough veteran.</v>

4358
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Ricardo has been around.</v>

4359
01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.080
<v Speaker 4>He's fought the best of the best.</v>

4360
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:41.281
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

4361
01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:44.560
<v Speaker 4>she's fought for the title and that was a really,</v>

4362
01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:48.470
<v Speaker 4>really professional performance by Ricardo came to win.</v>

4363
01:43:48.471 --> 01:43:48.880
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

4364
01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had that creepy mustache to beck back ticks.</v>

4365
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Creepy mustache.</v>

4366
01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4367
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:54.261
<v Speaker 4>I think he's young.</v>

4368
01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 4>He's exploring his looks,</v>

4369
01:43:55.251 --> 01:43:56.084
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4370
01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.190
<v Speaker 4>experimenting with the creepy,</v>

4371
01:43:58.250 --> 01:43:59.083
<v Speaker 4>creepy mustache.</v>

4372
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:00.440
<v Speaker 4>He's such a good kid though.</v>

4373
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.771
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>

4374
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 4>It was a very nice guy,</v>

4375
01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 4>but I was just super impressed with the way he handled llamas because llamas is,</v>

4376
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4377
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4378
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Lama says is well rounded as you're going to get these wrestlers get great</v>

4379
01:44:12.051 --> 01:44:12.650
<v Speaker 4>striking.</v>

4380
01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Great submission skills are like pretty much does any scene so much that for him</v>

4381
01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 4>to win and wind down the stretch,</v>

4382
01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:20.330
<v Speaker 4>like he was overwhelming.</v>

4383
01:44:20.331 --> 01:44:22.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm deep into the sacrament and the third I was like,</v>

4384
01:44:22.701 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 4>well this is a guy that's clearly hitting his stride and [inaudible] next level.</v>

4385
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:28.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4386
01:44:28.371 --> 01:44:28.501
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4387
01:44:28.501 --> 01:44:29.334
<v Speaker 4>he did a great job.</v>

4388
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Now when a guy like that it's coming off of a fight like the Darren Elkins</v>

4389
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:33.950
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

4390
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:34.281
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

4391
01:44:34.281 --> 01:44:36.260
<v Speaker 4>how do you build them back up after that fight?</v>

4392
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.971
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4393
01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:38.331
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

4394
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:42.140
<v Speaker 4>I feel like he was trying to do too much and he wore himself out in Elkins is</v>

4395
01:44:42.141 --> 01:44:43.880
<v Speaker 4>one of those guys where if you give them a window,</v>

4396
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 4>the fights over,</v>

4397
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:44.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4398
01:44:44.901 --> 01:44:45.201
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4399
01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:45.890
<v Speaker 4>he's one of those,</v>

4400
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 4>those guys who's dangerous,</v>

4401
01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:49.310
<v Speaker 4>he knows what to do in the right and the particular situation,</v>

4402
01:44:49.311 --> 01:44:50.144
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to panic.</v>

4403
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.010
<v Speaker 4>And he found the right right moment to beat,</v>

4404
01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:52.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4405
01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 4>Mirsada but I think just mears that overworked himself and he didn't find</v>

4406
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:56.990
<v Speaker 4>pockets too.</v>

4407
01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.990
<v Speaker 4>Cause the thing is you cannot exert yourself at a maximum pace forever.</v>

4408
01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:02.210
<v Speaker 4>We've got to find pockets of recovery and get back to it.</v>

4409
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:03.850
<v Speaker 4>I felt like he just a,</v>

4410
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:05.300
<v Speaker 4>he overextended himself in the fight.</v>

4411
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:05.631
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4412
01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that was the case too.</v>

4413
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:07.460
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

4414
01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.110
<v Speaker 4>how do you know when to,</v>

4415
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.831
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4416
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:11.060
<v Speaker 4>how do you know when to push?</v>

4417
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you want to break your opponent,</v>

4418
01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:13.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4419
01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.470
<v Speaker 4>So how do you know when you're breaking yourself?</v>

4420
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.830
<v Speaker 4>How do you know when your opponent has too much gas and you're not going to like</v>

4421
01:45:18.831 --> 01:45:22.580
<v Speaker 4>a guy like Elkins is famous for his durability in his heart,</v>

4422
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:23.411
<v Speaker 4>so he's a,</v>

4423
01:45:23.411 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 4>he's an interesting case.</v>

4424
01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:24.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4425
01:45:24.891 --> 01:45:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4426
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I think the master of that is George.</v>

4427
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.340
<v Speaker 4>George recovers in the realm.</v>

4428
01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 4>We always talk about recovering in the round and never showing the guy at your</v>

4429
01:45:31.881 --> 01:45:32.631
<v Speaker 4>maximum point.</v>

4430
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Like let's say we're fighting me and you and I see you back off because you're</v>

4431
01:45:35.541 --> 01:45:36.140
<v Speaker 4>tired.</v>

4432
01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 4>You're huffing and puffing and you sir,</v>

4433
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.480
<v Speaker 4>I know you're breaking point now.</v>

4434
01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.730
<v Speaker 4>I know that if I push this pace a little bit more,</v>

4435
01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:41.301
<v Speaker 4>you're going to break.</v>

4436
01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 4>There's no more reserves.</v>

4437
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.393
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

4438
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:47.480
<v Speaker 4>if you get to about 70% of your fatigue and then you start circling and I see</v>

4439
01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:47.991
<v Speaker 4>you're circling,</v>

4440
01:45:47.991 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 4>but I don't see you're fatigued,</v>

4441
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you're just doing that as a,</v>

4442
01:45:49.821 --> 01:45:50.181
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

4443
01:45:50.181 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

4444
01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:51.651
<v Speaker 4>as a decoy.</v>

4445
01:45:51.651 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 4>You're playing mind games with me,</v>

4446
01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.620
<v Speaker 4>but really you're recovering.</v>

4447
01:45:56.050 --> 01:45:59.660
<v Speaker 4>You're playing mind games with me or circling your tying me up in ways you'd be,</v>

4448
01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 4>you know that I'm never going to go over 70% I'm never going to red line in a</v>

4449
01:46:03.051 --> 01:46:03.800
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

4450
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Only at the last bit of the fight am I going to red line because I have a</v>

4451
01:46:06.921 --> 01:46:08.600
<v Speaker 4>reserve in case things go wrong.</v>

4452
01:46:08.601 --> 01:46:11.120
<v Speaker 4>I have a reserve to explode out of a position that I might need,</v>

4453
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:15.950
<v Speaker 4>so the only times I'll red line is if I'm in trouble in a fight and a half to go</v>

4454
01:46:15.951 --> 01:46:19.190
<v Speaker 4>all in because the fights can be over or it's the end of the fight.</v>

4455
01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.470
<v Speaker 4>The guys who go all in and around one for me,</v>

4456
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.380
<v Speaker 4>eventually they will lose because some guy's going to weather that storm</v>

4457
01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 4>sidestep and he's going to,</v>

4458
01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.530
<v Speaker 4>he's going to put the kill on you when you're,</v>

4459
01:46:27.531 --> 01:46:30.830
<v Speaker 4>when you're in recovery mode or like Francis and Ghana on Steep Immuno Church.</v>

4460
01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.753
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4461
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Francis came out guns blazing in the first round.</v>

4462
01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Blues Wad exactly in the second and the third.</v>

4463
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.721
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4464
01:46:37.721 --> 01:46:38.554
<v Speaker 4>Bate took over.</v>

4465
01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.560
<v Speaker 4>When you go for the kill,</v>

4466
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:43.340
<v Speaker 4>you're risking losing the decision or losing afterwards.</v>

4467
01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:44.121
<v Speaker 4>If you don't get the kill,</v>

4468
01:46:44.121 --> 01:46:44.751
<v Speaker 4>if you over extent,</v>

4469
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:45.584
<v Speaker 4>if you go all in,</v>

4470
01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:46.330
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4471
01:46:46.330 --> 01:46:47.330
<v Speaker 4>And there's no reserve,</v>

4472
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 4>you better get that kill because if you don't,</v>

4473
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.280
<v Speaker 4>what's amazing is that when guys go all in in the first round,</v>

4474
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:54.420
<v Speaker 4>even if they're in great shape,</v>

4475
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:56.700
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they don't recover enough to complete the fight,</v>

4476
01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4477
01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:00.630
<v Speaker 4>If the guy they're fighting is skilled enough to not allow them that,</v>

4478
01:47:00.670 --> 01:47:01.503
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4479
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:02.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4480
01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.240
<v Speaker 4>if you roll with a blue belt,</v>

4481
01:47:03.241 --> 01:47:04.074
<v Speaker 4>you'll never get tired.</v>

4482
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't have the skill to make me work.</v>

4483
01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4484
01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:07.771
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

4485
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 4>if I'm with a black belt and I get exhausted and now he's making me work,</v>

4486
01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

4487
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I may never recover.</v>

4488
01:47:13.650 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4489
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:14.580
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4490
01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:14.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4491
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:15.400
<v Speaker 4>That's uh,</v>

4492
01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:15.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4493
01:47:15.710 --> 01:47:15.921
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4494
01:47:15.921 --> 01:47:16.754
<v Speaker 4>it's not just,</v>

4495
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 4>it's also the way you go out.</v>

4496
01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.710
<v Speaker 4>If you go out full clip in that first round,</v>

4497
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.431
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4498
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 4>you have essentially sprinted yourself into a position where you're just so</v>

4499
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:28.644
<v Speaker 4>diminished.</v>

4500
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 4>There's so many fighters that are like that,</v>

4501
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:30.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4502
01:47:30.970 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Like Connor's kind of a good example.</v>

4503
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Connor is fantastic in the beginning of a fight,</v>

4504
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:37.590
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4505
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:38.371
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

4506
01:47:38.371 --> 01:47:39.480
<v Speaker 4>he gets to them third,</v>

4507
01:47:39.481 --> 01:47:39.841
<v Speaker 4>fourth,</v>

4508
01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:43.080
<v Speaker 4>and fifth rounds and he takes it like the Nate Diaz fight the second fight.</v>

4509
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:43.920
<v Speaker 4>He becomes human.</v>

4510
01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 4>He turned and walked away from him.</v>

4511
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was very human needed that break so badly.</v>

4512
01:47:49.770 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 4>When you see that,</v>

4513
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.580
<v Speaker 4>do you think that that is a case of putting,</v>

4514
01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to give away too much,</v>

4515
01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 4>cause you know George potentially wants to fight coming in with the red.</v>

4516
01:47:58.141 --> 01:47:58.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4517
01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that's a case of poor conditioning?</v>

4518
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that is a lack of experience in handling those moments because he's</v>

4519
01:48:08.401 --> 01:48:10.980
<v Speaker 4>so used to overwhelming people and taking them out early?</v>

4520
01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.270
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that is?</v>

4521
01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 4>I think it's partly genetic.</v>

4522
01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4523
01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:15.451
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4524
01:48:15.451 --> 01:48:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Because you see,</v>

4525
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.940
<v Speaker 4>I call it the touch of death.</v>

4526
01:48:17.941 --> 01:48:18.900
<v Speaker 4>You know he's got that left hand.</v>

4527
01:48:18.901 --> 01:48:19.734
<v Speaker 4>It's the touch of death.</v>

4528
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4529
01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:22.230
<v Speaker 4>That touch of death comes at a cost.</v>

4530
01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4531
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:23.940
<v Speaker 4>How do you have the touch of death?</v>

4532
01:48:23.941 --> 01:48:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Where does power come from?</v>

4533
01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:25.081
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4534
01:48:25.081 --> 01:48:25.231
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4535
01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:27.060
<v Speaker 4>if you look up Michael Colgan or were talking about earlier,</v>

4536
01:48:27.061 --> 01:48:27.421
<v Speaker 4>he has a,</v>

4537
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:29.190
<v Speaker 4>he has the criteria for power,</v>

4538
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.690
<v Speaker 4>but to the best of his knowledge,</v>

4539
01:48:30.691 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 4>this is where he believes power comes from.</v>

4540
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:32.551
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4541
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:34.890
<v Speaker 4>So I can't teach Hussein bolt will be powerful.</v>

4542
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:36.690
<v Speaker 4>I can only make him faster.</v>

4543
01:48:37.170 --> 01:48:38.820
<v Speaker 4>But where did that initial power come from?</v>

4544
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Number one on the list.</v>

4545
01:48:40.501 --> 01:48:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Number one is where your muscle is attached to your bowl was genetic.</v>

4546
01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:46.133
<v Speaker 4>So Tyson hits,</v>

4547
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.250
<v Speaker 4>he has a powerful left hook,</v>

4548
01:48:47.251 --> 01:48:49.200
<v Speaker 4>not because his coach taught him how to hit a left hook.</v>

4549
01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:52.500
<v Speaker 4>He could hit a left hook like that if you had a mediocre trainer.</v>

4550
01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:56.220
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with the leverage of his bolts.</v>

4551
01:48:56.250 --> 01:48:57.083
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

4552
01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:57.541
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4553
01:48:57.541 --> 01:48:57.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4554
01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.111
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4555
01:48:58.111 --> 01:48:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to imagine how like a,</v>

4556
01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:03.930
<v Speaker 4>like a really heavy poults weighs a hundred pounds and I want to stand it up,</v>

4557
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.171
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4558
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:08.670
<v Speaker 4>depending on where I grab it and then have more resistance or less resistance,</v>

4559
01:49:08.671 --> 01:49:09.600
<v Speaker 4>if I grab it near the end,</v>

4560
01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:10.434
<v Speaker 4>they have more leverage.</v>

4561
01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:14.700
<v Speaker 4>So where your muscles attached to your bone is gonna is gonna dictate how much</v>

4562
01:49:14.701 --> 01:49:15.570
<v Speaker 4>leverage you get out of it.</v>

4563
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Second most important element is the type of muscle fiber you have,</v>

4564
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:20.280
<v Speaker 4>the type.</v>

4565
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.260
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a fast twitch muscle fiber,</v>

4566
01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.780
<v Speaker 4>you can hold this oxygen,</v>

4567
01:49:24.810 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 4>but he can switch faster,</v>

4568
01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.053
<v Speaker 4>hence the name.</v>

4569
01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:29.490
<v Speaker 4>So if you're a slow twitch muscle fiber guy,</v>

4570
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.950
<v Speaker 4>you can metabolize more oxygen,</v>

4571
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 4>but she can't twitches fast.</v>

4572
01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:34.350
<v Speaker 4>So there's a give and take.</v>

4573
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Nikki is exactly.</v>

4574
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:37.291
<v Speaker 4>So you have a guy,</v>

4575
01:49:37.291 --> 01:49:37.681
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz,</v>

4576
01:49:37.681 --> 01:49:38.850
<v Speaker 4>who needs to knock you out with volume.</v>

4577
01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.440
<v Speaker 4>You can knock you out with one shot.</v>

4578
01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at Bj Penn.</v>

4579
01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.041
<v Speaker 4>If Ronald,</v>

4580
01:49:42.041 --> 01:49:42.811
<v Speaker 4>when he doesn't lock you out,</v>

4581
01:49:42.811 --> 01:49:43.790
<v Speaker 4>likelihood of knock you out.</v>

4582
01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:44.700
<v Speaker 4>Round two is less,</v>

4583
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:45.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4584
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Diaz is the opposite.</v>

4585
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 4>The likelihood of him knocking you out around</v>

4586
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.060
<v Speaker 2>three is higher than Ron one.</v>

4587
01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4588
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 2>because of the cumulative at the attack.</v>

4589
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4590
01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor look at his stats.</v>

4591
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It's all around one knockout run.</v>

4592
01:49:54.631 --> 01:49:55.370
<v Speaker 2>One knock out Ron,</v>

4593
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>

4594
01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Ron to knock out.</v>

4595
01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 2>He's fast twitch.</v>

4596
01:49:58.121 --> 01:49:59.630
<v Speaker 2>High leverage lefthand.</v>

4597
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4598
01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:01.900
<v Speaker 2>If you take them into deep waters,</v>

4599
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.800
<v Speaker 2>his fast twitch muscle fibers cannot metabolize it.</v>

4600
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Been with me whether maybe where they're so smart.</v>

4601
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:07.480
<v Speaker 2>He let him work.</v>

4602
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:12.310
<v Speaker 2>He let McGregor work for three rounds and you're getting excited.</v>

4603
01:50:12.311 --> 01:50:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Keep working,</v>

4604
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.863
<v Speaker 2>keep working,</v>

4605
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 2>and when you have nothing left,</v>

4606
01:50:15.101 --> 01:50:15.934
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put you out.</v>

4607
01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4608
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:16.790
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4609
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 2>there was such a brilliant strategy.</v>

4610
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:19.031
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

4611
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:21.430
<v Speaker 2>and it was so obvious how much more efficient he was.</v>

4612
01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:21.971
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4613
01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:22.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4614
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:23.590
<v Speaker 2>and more relaxed.</v>

4615
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Connor had his moments early in the fight where he,</v>

4616
01:50:26.301 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 2>he hit him with someone,</v>

4617
01:50:27.170 --> 01:50:28.930
<v Speaker 2>an unorthodox punches and some,</v>

4618
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:30.400
<v Speaker 2>some weird movement.</v>

4619
01:50:30.401 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 2>But after a while it was just,</v>

4620
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I found both of them had a brilliant performance cause when Mcgregor did to go</v>

4621
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:35.590
<v Speaker 2>in his world,</v>

4622
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:36.270
<v Speaker 2>oh crap.</v>

4623
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:37.103
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

4624
01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:37.780
<v Speaker 2>It was brilliant.</v>

4625
01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Just crazy crazy that that had even happened.</v>

4626
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

4627
01:50:41.291 --> 01:50:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Stop and think about it.</v>

4628
01:50:42.151 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the world got a magic trick.</v>

4629
01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:44.973
<v Speaker 2>It was unbelievable.</v>

4630
01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I want George to fight Mayweather.</v>

4631
01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I keep bothering you.</v>

4632
01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Fight me with it.</v>

4633
01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:48.753
<v Speaker 2>You fight it.</v>

4634
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:49.481
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4635
01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:49.931
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

4636
01:50:49.931 --> 01:50:50.764
<v Speaker 2>I know it's crazy,</v>

4637
01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:52.960
<v Speaker 2>but I bet may whether it would do it.</v>

4638
01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:54.671
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4639
01:50:54.671 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 2>George might have to lose a shitload of weight.</v>

4640
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4641
01:50:56.571 --> 01:50:57.550
<v Speaker 2>they'll find a catch weight.</v>

4642
01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Mayweather?</v>

4643
01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 2>His word,</v>

4644
01:50:59.020 --> 01:50:59.801
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get concussed.</v>

4645
01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:01.600
<v Speaker 2>He's fought all the top punches in the world.</v>

4646
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4647
01:51:02.170 --> 01:51:04.270
<v Speaker 2>He's just gonna have to worry about George's volume in reach,</v>

4648
01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 2>but he can handle himself and George can have the limb itself,</v>

4649
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but the whole world is going to tune into that one.</v>

4650
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:09.963
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4651
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I like George is selling it like,</v>

4652
01:51:11.261 --> 01:51:12.094
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4653
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:12.551
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>

4654
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:12.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4655
01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:13.151
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

4656
01:51:13.151 --> 01:51:14.500
<v Speaker 2>But George doesn't want to fight.</v>

4657
01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.690
<v Speaker 2>A smaller guy doesn't want to call out a smarter guy,</v>

4658
01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to have to come from me.</v>

4659
01:51:18.101 --> 01:51:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's going to have to file.</v>

4660
01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:21.910
<v Speaker 2>There's another big money fight.</v>

4661
01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4662
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.040
<v Speaker 2>But is it a bit as big a money fight?</v>

4663
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

4664
01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.560
<v Speaker 2>The real big money fight is in somehow or another McGregor convincing the world</v>

4665
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 2>that he could beat him in the second fight.</v>

4666
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I know there were weather.</v>

4667
01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:33.363
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4668
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:34.201
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard sell.</v>

4669
01:51:34.201 --> 01:51:35.034
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard sell.</v>

4670
01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.070
<v Speaker 2>We bought that one already.</v>

4671
01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:36.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4672
01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:38.160
<v Speaker 2>we bought that one,</v>

4673
01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>

4674
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.210
<v Speaker 2>to fight Mcgregor.</v>

4675
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:43.450
<v Speaker 2>There was the one thing of doing it in the octagon and doing it with small</v>

4676
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 2>gloves and no kicks.</v>

4677
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was,</v>

4678
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 2>there was some talk of that and people were like,</v>

4679
01:51:48.341 --> 01:51:48.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4680
01:51:48.441 --> 01:51:49.480
<v Speaker 2>where's this talk coming from?</v>

4681
01:51:49.481 --> 01:51:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was legit or not.</v>

4682
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:51.521
<v Speaker 2>I called Dana.</v>

4683
01:51:51.521 --> 01:51:52.001
<v Speaker 2>Dana said,</v>

4684
01:51:52.001 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 2>it's 100% bullshit,</v>

4685
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 2>but I'm getting the state can enforce that.</v>

4686
01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 2>If Mcgregor wants to throw a kick,</v>

4687
01:51:58.121 --> 01:51:58.870
<v Speaker 2>he'll throw a kick.</v>

4688
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:59.703
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4689
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:00.880
<v Speaker 2>It has to be gentleman's rule.</v>

4690
01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when that happened with Tim Silvia and Ray Mercer?</v>

4691
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4692
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia fought Ray Mercer and they had originally been scheduled to fight a</v>

4693
01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:10.450
<v Speaker 2>boxing match Edelman's rules,</v>

4694
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:14.620
<v Speaker 2>but the commission said they wouldn't sanction the fight because Tim Silvia</v>

4695
01:52:14.621 --> 01:52:16.090
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any pro boxing experience.</v>

4696
01:52:16.091 --> 01:52:21.091
<v Speaker 2>Ray Mercer Olympic gold medal as former world champion and they decided to have</v>

4697
01:52:21.791 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 2>an MMA fight,</v>

4698
01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 2>but they had a gentleman's agreement to not throw kicks.</v>

4699
01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Tim Opens up with an inside leg kick.</v>

4700
01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.380
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen a fight?</v>

4701
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4702
01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>

4703
01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I just forgot about the chick.</v>

4704
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 2>It starts off and Tim Silvia immediately.</v>

4705
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:35.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4706
01:52:35.231 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 2>this is go before this,</v>

4707
01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:36.821
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

4708
01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:37.601
<v Speaker 2>Before this cause this is,</v>

4709
01:52:37.601 --> 01:52:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that's the Kao.</v>

4710
01:52:38.890 --> 01:52:40.150
<v Speaker 2>If you go before this,</v>

4711
01:52:40.151 --> 01:52:44.710
<v Speaker 2>they open up and Tim kicks him right away and let ray see raid puts his hands</v>

4712
01:52:44.711 --> 01:52:44.930
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

4713
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Your mother fucker.</v>

4714
01:52:45.801 --> 01:52:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this shit.</v>

4715
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4716
01:52:47.871 --> 01:52:49.040
<v Speaker 2>that's why he didn't give a look.</v>

4717
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And then he hit some ways down.</v>

4718
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.740
<v Speaker 2>He's just share.</v>

4719
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh Zim,</v>

4720
01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 2>let me see that one more time.</v>

4721
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh boom.</v>

4722
01:52:57.531 --> 01:52:59.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean come on son.</v>

4723
01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:01.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a 50 year old ray Mercer at the tile.</v>

4724
01:53:02.710 --> 01:53:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4725
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:03.861
<v Speaker 2>Ray.</v>

4726
01:53:03.861 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4727
01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that's why he gave him that look.</v>

4728
01:53:05.151 --> 01:53:05.960
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

4729
01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't believe it.</v>

4730
01:53:06.861 --> 01:53:07.161
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4731
01:53:07.161 --> 01:53:08.930
<v Speaker 2>I thought we weren't kicking man.</v>

4732
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.900
<v Speaker 2>So they have made a gentleman's agreement and Tim Silvia was like,</v>

4733
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:12.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4734
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:13.460
<v Speaker 2>whatever dude.</v>

4735
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.220
<v Speaker 2>But he paid for that.</v>

4736
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got starched.</v>

4737
01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:19.400
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

4738
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:19.970
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

4739
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:22.340
<v Speaker 2>it's also the difference in skill level.</v>

4740
01:53:22.341 --> 01:53:27.320
<v Speaker 2>You see a guy like ray Mercer who's seen all these patterns and a guy like Tim</v>

4741
01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Silvia has just so used to MMA fighters striking.</v>

4742
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a different,</v>

4743
01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:32.691
<v Speaker 2>different speed.</v>

4744
01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

4745
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:33.620
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

4746
01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:38.620
<v Speaker 2>How much does it help fighters to cross train in these different disciplines and</v>

4747
01:53:39.591 --> 01:53:43.930
<v Speaker 2>how difficult is it to take those skills and then to put them into their overall</v>

4748
01:53:43.931 --> 01:53:44.764
<v Speaker 2>MMA game?</v>

4749
01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's beneficial if you do it to a certain degree because if you go too</v>

4750
01:53:47.421 --> 01:53:47.751
<v Speaker 2>much less,</v>

4751
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:49.310
<v Speaker 2>he always spargel pro boxers.</v>

4752
01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:50.391
<v Speaker 2>There's a distance.</v>

4753
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not realistic because in MMA you're further away from each other.</v>

4754
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4755
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:56.140
<v Speaker 2>so when I get to that distance,</v>

4756
01:53:56.141 --> 01:53:56.974
<v Speaker 2>the guy's going to grab me.</v>

4757
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.830
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

4758
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.420
<v Speaker 2>because there's more punches per second.</v>

4759
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:02.630
<v Speaker 2>It's more of an intensive training.</v>

4760
01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:05.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you can deal with that speed of training,</v>

4761
01:54:05.091 --> 01:54:06.420
<v Speaker 2>then later when I put you in MMA zone,</v>

4762
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:07.460
<v Speaker 2>when it's slower a little bit.</v>

4763
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 2>So there's that element.</v>

4764
01:54:08.601 --> 01:54:11.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a balancing act as there's a boxing with a pro boxer,</v>

4765
01:54:11.151 --> 01:54:14.240
<v Speaker 2>but then there's doing it too much that when you're sparring with MMA fighter,</v>

4766
01:54:14.241 --> 01:54:14.841
<v Speaker 2>it's harder to hit.</v>

4767
01:54:14.841 --> 01:54:16.700
<v Speaker 2>That may may fighter than it is for me to hit the boxer.</v>

4768
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4769
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:19.190
<v Speaker 2>because we're in a different pattern were different worlds.</v>

4770
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to do just a bit of that.</v>

4771
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.883
<v Speaker 2>Not Too much.</v>

4772
01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:22.461
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

4773
01:54:22.461 --> 01:54:27.461
<v Speaker 2>are there any patterns that people pick up in boxing that become a real problem</v>

4774
01:54:27.621 --> 01:54:28.820
<v Speaker 2>when you add in elbows?</v>

4775
01:54:28.821 --> 01:54:29.654
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4776
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:29.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4777
01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:30.740
<v Speaker 2>When you ducked down,</v>

4778
01:54:30.741 --> 01:54:31.460
<v Speaker 2>some guys just start,</v>

4779
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:31.700
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4780
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.181
<v Speaker 2>you throw up your hand.</v>

4781
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:32.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to duck down.</v>

4782
01:54:32.901 --> 01:54:33.171
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4783
01:54:33.171 --> 01:54:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you do that once with me.</v>

4784
01:54:34.251 --> 01:54:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing a left kick right after Moran.</v>

4785
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing a shallow right hand and the left kicks coming upstairs and when</v>

4786
01:54:38.511 --> 01:54:39.940
<v Speaker 2>you slip you're slipping right into the kick.</v>

4787
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:40.611
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones.</v>

4788
01:54:40.611 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Cormier.</v>

4789
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:42.021
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4790
01:54:42.021 --> 01:54:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was a pattern that John had seen and they even talked about it</v>

4791
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:47.600
<v Speaker 2>beforehand with Dennis said,</v>

4792
01:54:47.601 --> 01:54:49.640
<v Speaker 2>don't think you're going to hit me with that left high kick,</v>

4793
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of crazy when you see how it went down.</v>

4794
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4795
01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing when people just develop a sort of pattern that they just</v>

4796
01:54:58.821 --> 01:55:01.490
<v Speaker 2>keep repeating over and over again and then it's instinctual.</v>

4797
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:03.110
<v Speaker 2>You want to take it out now?</v>

4798
01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4799
01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:03.920
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

4800
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:04.371
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

4801
01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:05.204
<v Speaker 2>Taken it out.</v>

4802
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:06.230
<v Speaker 2>This and that.</v>

4803
01:55:06.230 --> 01:55:11.120
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that when you see people learning technique,</v>

4804
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:16.150
<v Speaker 2>one of the more difficult things is to relearn something once you learn it.</v>

4805
01:55:16.371 --> 01:55:17.204
<v Speaker 2>One way,</v>

4806
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:22.420
<v Speaker 2>like with the kicking in particular when they get tired or when they get</v>

4807
01:55:22.971 --> 01:55:23.600
<v Speaker 2>nervous,</v>

4808
01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.770
<v Speaker 2>they revert back to their old way of kicking and you you see it.</v>

4809
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Especially if they learned it young.</v>

4810
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4811
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:30.613
<v Speaker 2>it's hardwired.</v>

4812
01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4813
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:32.780
<v Speaker 2>How do you get a guy out of that?</v>

4814
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:34.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been very successful.</v>

4815
01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>

4816
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:37.970
<v Speaker 2>if I take a guy who has been kicking taekwondo his entire life and then I tried</v>

4817
01:55:37.971 --> 01:55:38.870
<v Speaker 2>to teach him a Thai kick,</v>

4818
01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:39.733
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy.</v>

4819
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:40.431
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult.</v>

4820
01:55:40.431 --> 01:55:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4821
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 2>That's why I believe when you're young you have to have a diversity.</v>

4822
01:55:42.891 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>You have learn how to kick like a tie,</v>

4823
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:44.881
<v Speaker 4>like a taekwondo guy,</v>

4824
01:55:44.881 --> 01:55:45.571
<v Speaker 4>like a karate guy,</v>

4825
01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 4>like a kickboxer,</v>

4826
01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:47.401
<v Speaker 4>the variety,</v>

4827
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:49.920
<v Speaker 4>and then you can go out there and you can morph your style.</v>

4828
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:53.340
<v Speaker 4>You can exchange from one style of kicking to another.</v>

4829
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.241
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

4830
01:55:54.241 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 4>if you've done 10 years of one way and you are hardwired that way,</v>

4831
01:55:58.620 --> 01:55:59.401
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult.</v>

4832
01:55:59.401 --> 01:56:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Almost not worth it to we do it.</v>

4833
01:56:00.691 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Just let him kick the way he kicks real.</v>

4834
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4835
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 4>It's not worth it.</v>

4836
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Not Worth it.</v>

4837
01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:04.561
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4838
01:56:04.561 --> 01:56:06.240
<v Speaker 4>because you're going to treat him for him for so many hours.</v>

4839
01:56:06.241 --> 01:56:06.851
<v Speaker 4>Then he's going to go in there.</v>

4840
01:56:06.851 --> 01:56:07.561
<v Speaker 4>He's going to revert back.</v>

4841
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:08.280
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

4842
01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.190
<v Speaker 4>when he's under the pressure and the stress is going to revert back to what he</v>

4843
01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:14.760
<v Speaker 4>normally does when he's a little bit tired because it's more efficient for him.</v>

4844
01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:15.933
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

4845
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.000
<v Speaker 4>So you're asking him now to do something new.</v>

4846
01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:21.150
<v Speaker 4>Is there any way to rewire a person's brain?</v>

4847
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Not that I know of.</v>

4848
01:56:22.231 --> 01:56:22.441
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

4849
01:56:22.441 --> 01:56:23.130
<v Speaker 4>not in that.</v>

4850
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>

4851
01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:24.181
<v Speaker 4>Of course you can.</v>

4852
01:56:24.181 --> 01:56:25.320
<v Speaker 4>You can change someone's behavior.</v>

4853
01:56:25.321 --> 01:56:26.154
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

4854
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.530
<v Speaker 4>But if it's hardwired from a young age,</v>

4855
01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about it's a long term project.</v>

4856
01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:32.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you have the amount of time you could do it?</v>

4857
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:35.400
<v Speaker 4>But it's a lot of time and energy and it's painful.</v>

4858
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:37.680
<v Speaker 4>It's painful to undo an old way.</v>

4859
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4860
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of energy.</v>

4861
01:56:40.291 --> 01:56:42.420
<v Speaker 4>The guy will feel tired of the Gulf feel sluggish,</v>

4862
01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 4>like I'll feel uncomfortable because he's doing something inefficient.</v>

4863
01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:50.490
<v Speaker 4>You see those patterns though where where you watch a guy fight and you go,</v>

4864
01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:50.941
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4865
01:56:50.941 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 4>why does he always do that?</v>

4866
01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:57.111
<v Speaker 4>He's always throwing these wide looping punches like why can he throw a fish,</v>

4867
01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.760
<v Speaker 4>smooth technical punches.</v>

4868
01:56:59.790 --> 01:57:00.623
<v Speaker 4>He might've learned,</v>

4869
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:00.821
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

4870
01:57:00.821 --> 01:57:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I've had that problem.</v>

4871
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.330
<v Speaker 4>They learned that wrong early on in the career.</v>

4872
01:57:03.331 --> 01:57:04.141
<v Speaker 4>Then when they get to you,</v>

4873
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:05.280
<v Speaker 4>they're good enough to get to you.</v>

4874
01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:05.971
<v Speaker 4>They're good enough to,</v>

4875
01:57:05.971 --> 01:57:06.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4876
01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:07.770
<v Speaker 4>come near the UFC another other.</v>

4877
01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 4>They want that next level and you're working with this new athlete who has so</v>

4878
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 4>many inefficiencies.</v>

4879
01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.810
<v Speaker 4>You've got to remove them one by one gently.</v>

4880
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:16.950
<v Speaker 4>If you try to re haul him,</v>

4881
01:57:16.951 --> 01:57:19.650
<v Speaker 4>you just confused him and he just doesn't know what to do anymore.</v>

4882
01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:20.790
<v Speaker 4>What do you want me to do coach?</v>

4883
01:57:20.850 --> 01:57:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm totally lost.</v>

4884
01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:22.870
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4885
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:23.371
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>

4886
01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:24.600
<v Speaker 4>it's like a scientific experiment,</v>

4887
01:57:24.601 --> 01:57:24.721
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4888
01:57:24.721 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 4>You isolate one variable.</v>

4889
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.570
<v Speaker 4>If you change too many things,</v>

4890
01:57:27.571 --> 01:57:29.040
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what caused what anymore and you're in it.</v>

4891
01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:29.970
<v Speaker 4>You're in a chaotic,</v>

4892
01:57:29.971 --> 01:57:31.500
<v Speaker 4>now you're now you're in a world of chaos.</v>

4893
01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.210
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't know what works anymore.</v>

4894
01:57:33.211 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's wrong.</v>

4895
01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

4896
01:57:34.330 --> 01:57:35.970
<v Speaker 4>w one thing at a time.</v>

4897
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.450
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to flood you and we don't want to bottleneck queue what we're</v>

4898
01:57:39.451 --> 01:57:39.721
<v Speaker 4>taking.</v>

4899
01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:41.010
<v Speaker 4>You go from one place to another,</v>

4900
01:57:41.011 --> 01:57:44.070
<v Speaker 4>one step at a time gently and you have to ask yourself,</v>

4901
01:57:44.071 --> 01:57:45.690
<v Speaker 4>what's the one thing I can help this guy with?</v>

4902
01:57:45.690 --> 01:57:47.140
<v Speaker 4>The one thing they had,</v>

4903
01:57:47.290 --> 01:57:48.630
<v Speaker 4>they'll change the rest of the system.</v>

4904
01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:49.620
<v Speaker 4>This is the most important thing.</v>

4905
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.570
<v Speaker 4>And let's do that one thing at a time.</v>

4906
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:54.660
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a guy and say,</v>

4907
01:57:54.661 --> 01:57:54.841
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4908
01:57:54.841 --> 01:57:58.440
<v Speaker 4>he's got a kill Christian background or something like that and you see he</v>

4909
01:57:58.441 --> 01:58:00.720
<v Speaker 4>throws kicks but he keeps landing with the instep.</v>

4910
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.790
<v Speaker 4>You just let him keep doing it like that.</v>

4911
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4912
01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.253
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4913
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.900
<v Speaker 4>It depends how many years he has and how much time we have before the next fight</v>

4914
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.980
<v Speaker 4>because I believe it can work.</v>

4915
01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:08.370
<v Speaker 4>It works.</v>

4916
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:10.320
<v Speaker 4>The reason why karate is still here is because it worked,</v>

4917
01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:11.161
<v Speaker 4>right guys.</v>

4918
01:58:11.161 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 4>One right.</v>

4919
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:12.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4920
01:58:12.421 --> 01:58:13.250
<v Speaker 4>it's exists.</v>

4921
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:13.641
<v Speaker 4>Friday's not,</v>

4922
01:58:13.641 --> 01:58:14.440
<v Speaker 4>and it's not a bad spasm.</v>

4923
01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:14.820
<v Speaker 4>It works.</v>

4924
01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:15.653
<v Speaker 4>If you can make it work,</v>

4925
01:58:16.170 --> 01:58:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I might teach a quality guys in boxing and then his karate will shine even more</v>

4926
01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:21.120
<v Speaker 4>cause he could bust.</v>

4927
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4928
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 4>that does seem to be the problem is when,</v>

4929
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4930
01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:24.990
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4931
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo guides in particular,</v>

4932
01:58:26.970 --> 01:58:28.500
<v Speaker 4>they don't punch to the face.</v>

4933
01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 4>So when they get into sparring situations and they're first learning how to do</v>

4934
01:58:31.861 --> 01:58:31.991
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

4935
01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:34.560
<v Speaker 4>and we saw that with Raymond Daniels early in his career as well,</v>

4936
01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:37.160
<v Speaker 4>just have the hardest time with hands.</v>

4937
01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

4938
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 4>So do you take a guy like that and just have them only box or,</v>

4939
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I would make them bucks a lot and that'll open up his kicks even more.</v>

4940
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Definitely no doubt about it.</v>

4941
01:58:46.841 --> 01:58:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Especially with his reach and his,</v>

4942
01:58:48.311 --> 01:58:48.671
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

4943
01:58:48.671 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4944
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:49.481
<v Speaker 2>his distance,</v>

4945
01:58:49.481 --> 01:58:50.440
<v Speaker 2>his foot work that he has.</v>

4946
01:58:50.441 --> 01:58:50.981
<v Speaker 2>You can look,</v>

4947
01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:51.814
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4948
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:52.571
<v Speaker 2>he could do a lot more,</v>

4949
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:53.404
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4950
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you write all this stuff down?</v>

4951
01:58:55.481 --> 01:58:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Like your thoughts on these things?</v>

4952
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I know you do your youtube series and you have,</v>

4953
01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever considered putting out a book on your ideas?</v>

4954
01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.801
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a book,</v>

4955
01:59:02.801 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's more fun.</v>

4956
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:04.690
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a philosophy book.</v>

4957
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Then next I have a background philosophy.</v>

4958
01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:07.151
<v Speaker 2>Have a degree in philosophy.</v>

4959
01:59:07.151 --> 01:59:09.580
<v Speaker 2>So I spend a lot of time just contemplating things.</v>

4960
01:59:09.581 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 2>So I do a lot of fight philosophy stuff.</v>

4961
01:59:11.651 --> 01:59:12.484
<v Speaker 2>I write it down,</v>

4962
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.560
<v Speaker 2>publish a book,</v>

4963
01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:15.130
<v Speaker 2>not really interested in that to be honest with you.</v>

4964
01:59:15.131 --> 01:59:17.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm more interested in going in philosophy,</v>

4965
01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>writing about philosophy,</v>

4966
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:19.600
<v Speaker 2>not so much MMA,</v>

4967
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:20.970
<v Speaker 2>like philosophy,</v>

4968
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:22.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4969
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 2>more about chew with reality,</v>

4970
01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:24.281
<v Speaker 2>a paradigms,</v>

4971
01:59:24.281 --> 01:59:24.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4972
01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:24.641
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

4973
01:59:24.641 --> 01:59:25.690
<v Speaker 2>how we see the world,</v>

4974
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4975
01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 2>what is truth,</v>

4976
01:59:27.131 --> 01:59:27.761
<v Speaker 2>what is reality,</v>

4977
01:59:27.761 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things.</v>

4978
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds weird that's coming from an MMA coach,</v>

4979
01:59:30.071 --> 01:59:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but I do a lot of philosophy on my own,</v>

4980
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.800
<v Speaker 2>in my own personal life.</v>

4981
01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's weird at all.</v>

4982
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that what you do is essentially your taking fighters in preparing</v>

4983
01:59:39.491 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 2>them for one of the most difficult challenges in all professional sports.</v>

4984
01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:44.980
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's,</v>

4985
01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a more difficult challenge.</v>

4986
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:48.700
<v Speaker 2>It's outside of war.</v>

4987
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:49.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4988
01:59:49.181 --> 01:59:49.591
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

4989
01:59:49.591 --> 01:59:49.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4990
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Or being a firefighter or a police officer where you actually putting your life</v>

4991
01:59:53.471 --> 01:59:54.304
<v Speaker 2>in danger.</v>

4992
01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4993
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4994
01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:57.430
<v Speaker 2>combat sports or just,</v>

4995
01:59:57.431 --> 02:00:02.431
<v Speaker 2>it's extremely difficult to do and to be able to do like what you've done with</v>

4996
02:00:02.441 --> 02:00:04.450
<v Speaker 2>George and what George has done as well.</v>

4997
02:00:04.451 --> 02:00:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean what you guys have done together,</v>

4998
02:00:05.831 --> 02:00:10.831
<v Speaker 2>it's just an incredible accomplishment and especially him coming back after four</v>

4999
02:00:11.411 --> 02:00:14.650
<v Speaker 2>years off and looking better than he ever looked in the past.</v>

5000
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:19.890
<v Speaker 2>That was what was crazy when he came back and the fluidity of his combinations,</v>

5001
02:00:21.101 --> 02:00:24.100
<v Speaker 2>the way he looked and the way he sunk that rear naked choke,</v>

5002
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:29.520
<v Speaker 2>that was a rare rear naked choke and MMA where the blade of the hand was on the</v>

5003
02:00:29.741 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 2>back of the neck and it was just fully sunk in.</v>

5004
02:00:32.710 --> 02:00:35.770
<v Speaker 2>You know that that you don't really see guys get the choke,</v>

5005
02:00:35.771 --> 02:00:40.090
<v Speaker 2>but you're seeing that old school Ken shamrock style back on their attempt to</v>

5006
02:00:40.091 --> 02:00:40.924
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

5007
02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll never talk to this.</v>

5008
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 2>You put me on if the hand's is not behind [inaudible] you'd rather get put put</v>

5009
02:00:45.851 --> 02:00:46.270
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

5010
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.541
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

5011
02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:50.190
<v Speaker 2>I was reading one of my students yesterday and I let him take him out.</v>

5012
02:00:50.191 --> 02:00:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I was kind of toying with him and let him take my back and he was stronger</v>

5013
02:00:54.191 --> 02:00:54.611
<v Speaker 2>than I thought.</v>

5014
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:55.800
<v Speaker 2>He was like he,</v>

5015
02:00:55.801 --> 02:00:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I haven't wrestled with him in 10 years.</v>

5016
02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I just put out a youtube video of me and him.</v>

5017
02:00:58.990 --> 02:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>If you guys want to put it up,</v>

5018
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:00.933
<v Speaker 2>it would be funny,</v>

5019
02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

5020
02:01:01.730 --> 02:01:04.960
<v Speaker 2>we were rolling off camera and I kind of let him take my back and I never give</v>

5021
02:01:04.961 --> 02:01:05.411
<v Speaker 2>up my bag,</v>

5022
02:01:05.411 --> 02:01:06.620
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I know he's probably about,</v>

5023
02:01:06.621 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 2>so I'll just kind of toying with him a little and he put a choke kid and I was</v>

5024
02:01:10.481 --> 02:01:10.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5025
02:01:10.601 --> 02:01:11.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5026
02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:11.913
<v Speaker 2>let's see if he can finish.</v>

5027
02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think he could finish it.</v>

5028
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden you've got in deeper and he didn't have the hand behind my</v>

5029
02:01:16.421 --> 02:01:16.581
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

5030
02:01:16.581 --> 02:01:16.841
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

5031
02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:17.674
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tap.</v>

5032
02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:18.311
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

5033
02:01:18.311 --> 02:01:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I would have to this impossible.</v>

5034
02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:19.811
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

5035
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:20.644
<v Speaker 2>he should know better.</v>

5036
02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5037
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:22.720
<v Speaker 2>If I let them tap me with this,</v>

5038
02:01:22.721 --> 02:01:23.620
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna think he did it right.</v>

5039
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.311
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

5040
02:01:24.311 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5041
02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

5042
02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:25.390
<v Speaker 2>eh.</v>

5043
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:26.480
<v Speaker 2>And then when he took a breath,</v>

5044
02:01:26.481 --> 02:01:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I just took,</v>

5045
02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I just took his hand out because I could reach your hand.</v>

5046
02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:28.631
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5047
02:01:28.631 --> 02:01:29.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not tucked away behind it.</v>

5048
02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:30.773
<v Speaker 2>And I got out.</v>

5049
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll never talked to this man.</v>

5050
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

5051
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>So he's doing this.</v>

5052
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5053
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:34.571
<v Speaker 2>His hand,</v>

5054
02:01:34.571 --> 02:01:34.841
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

5055
02:01:34.841 --> 02:01:36.970
<v Speaker 2>here it has to be here.</v>

5056
02:01:36.971 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>That MMA gloves or uh,</v>

5057
02:01:39.730 --> 02:01:39.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5058
02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:40.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5059
02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:40.490
<v Speaker 2>flow.</v>

5060
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Fluor full.</v>

5061
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5062
02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5063
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a good purple belt.</v>

5064
02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:43.371
<v Speaker 2>He's tough guy.</v>

5065
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:44.151
<v Speaker 2>Very good shape.</v>

5066
02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Strong.</v>

5067
02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:46.610
<v Speaker 2>And the is not in the zoo.</v>

5068
02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.473
<v Speaker 2>That was off camera,</v>

5069
02:01:47.690 --> 02:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

5070
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I would never talk to this like even in practice because it's not on the choke</v>

5071
02:01:53.391 --> 02:01:54.080
<v Speaker 2>is not on,</v>

5072
02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:54.471
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5073
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:54.741
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5074
02:01:54.741 --> 02:01:55.574
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5075
02:01:55.670 --> 02:01:56.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5076
02:01:56.091 --> 02:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely a difference,</v>

5077
02:01:57.321 --> 02:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>but some guys have gotten it even in the UFC with just a gable grip.</v>

5078
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:02.330
<v Speaker 2>The guys,</v>

5079
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:03.163
<v Speaker 2>the guy who,</v>

5080
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was being choked.</v>

5081
02:02:04.810 --> 02:02:05.031
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5082
02:02:05.031 --> 02:02:06.020
<v Speaker 2>with the Gable grip works,</v>

5083
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:07.223
<v Speaker 2>because I kind of grew,</v>

5084
02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:08.093
<v Speaker 2>I kind of grab your hand.</v>

5085
02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

5086
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:09.403
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

5087
02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Like if your hand is here and I can grab it,</v>

5088
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:12.650
<v Speaker 2>why would I choke?</v>

5089
02:02:12.810 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Why would I,</v>

5090
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:14.660
<v Speaker 2>why would I tap?</v>

5091
02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.381
<v Speaker 2>I can hold your hand.</v>

5092
02:02:15.381 --> 02:02:16.214
<v Speaker 2>I can grab onto it.</v>

5093
02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:16.551
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5094
02:02:16.551 --> 02:02:16.761
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5095
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:17.594
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5096
02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5097
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:22.750
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that in the early days that was how everyone did a real nice,</v>

5098
02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:24.080
<v Speaker 2>it was more chronic.</v>

5099
02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>It's more panic.</v>

5100
02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>You okay,</v>

5101
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:28.100
<v Speaker 2>oxygen is lower and you're topping,</v>

5102
02:02:28.101 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to go out.</v>

5103
02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.710
<v Speaker 2>People just didn't know any better.</v>

5104
02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5105
02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 2>That was okay to do.</v>

5106
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:33.361
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5107
02:02:33.361 --> 02:02:35.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not that that palm and the back of the head was okay to do.</v>

5108
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who figured out to do this.</v>

5109
02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:39.830
<v Speaker 2>No problem behind the head is is okay.</v>

5110
02:02:39.831 --> 02:02:40.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against that.</v>

5111
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:43.430
<v Speaker 2>It's when the hand is top of the head bride,</v>

5112
02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:44.750
<v Speaker 2>it has to be unreachable.</v>

5113
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:45.501
<v Speaker 2>If I can reach it,</v>

5114
02:02:45.501 --> 02:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not tapping.</v>

5115
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.843
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5116
02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not tired it.</v>

5117
02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:47.991
<v Speaker 2>I forget that.</v>

5118
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:48.824
<v Speaker 2>Why would it happen?</v>

5119
02:02:49.250 --> 02:02:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5120
02:02:49.630 --> 02:02:50.650
<v Speaker 2>it's an experience a few times.</v>

5121
02:02:50.651 --> 02:02:50.991
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

5122
02:02:50.991 --> 02:02:51.824
<v Speaker 2>you panicked a bit.</v>

5123
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:54.650
<v Speaker 2>What's your feeling though on tapping?</v>

5124
02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Because here's the thing about tapping like this.</v>

5125
02:02:57.471 --> 02:02:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I've had some injuries were like,</v>

5126
02:02:59.061 --> 02:02:59.481
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

5127
02:02:59.481 --> 02:03:04.481
<v Speaker 2>I should have just tap and I got out of it and I kept rolling and then my elbows</v>

5128
02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:05.151
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>

5129
02:03:05.151 --> 02:03:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't do chin ups for a couple of months.</v>

5130
02:03:06.850 --> 02:03:07.683
<v Speaker 2>Top quick.</v>

5131
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:08.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to,</v>

5132
02:03:08.931 --> 02:03:11.840
<v Speaker 2>strangle holds easily except for gala things.</v>

5133
02:03:11.841 --> 02:03:12.890
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a torque my neck,</v>

5134
02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:13.971
<v Speaker 2>but a rear naked,</v>

5135
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:15.800
<v Speaker 2>there's no joint issue so I won't top,</v>

5136
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm stubborn as the next guy.</v>

5137
02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:20.020
<v Speaker 2>My joints I top right away and I don't,</v>

5138
02:03:20.021 --> 02:03:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't put any miles on my joints and I want to be as good as it can be,</v>

5139
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:25.710
<v Speaker 2>as healthy as it can be.</v>

5140
02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It cause I want to roll till I'm,</v>

5141
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5142
02:03:27.741 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 2>like the week before I die.</v>

5143
02:03:28.821 --> 02:03:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I want to be rolling the week before.</v>

5144
02:03:31.610 --> 02:03:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the ultimate goal that very few people ever achieve.</v>

5145
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Every I know so many Jujitsu guys that are so busted up.</v>

5146
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Like Eddie Bravo has an artificial disc in his lower back.</v>

5147
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Both of his shoulders are completely fucked and he's trying to avoid surgery in</v>

5148
02:03:48.081 --> 02:03:48.710
<v Speaker 2>his shoulders.</v>

5149
02:03:48.710 --> 02:03:49.440
<v Speaker 2>And he's knee too,</v>

5150
02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:49.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5151
02:03:49.671 --> 02:03:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was just with him in Vegas,</v>

5152
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>his ACL,</v>

5153
02:03:52.971 --> 02:03:56.780
<v Speaker 2>he had a tear in his ACL and then he just got his knee operated on.</v>

5154
02:03:56.781 --> 02:03:58.130
<v Speaker 2>He had a bucket handle tear,</v>

5155
02:03:58.131 --> 02:03:59.840
<v Speaker 2>so he got his meniscus repaired.</v>

5156
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.801
<v Speaker 2>But his,</v>

5157
02:04:00.801 --> 02:04:00.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5158
02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:02.180
<v Speaker 2>his ACL was,</v>

5159
02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:03.014
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5160
02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.890
<v Speaker 2>at least partially torn and he,</v>

5161
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:06.260
<v Speaker 2>he's letting it heal.</v>

5162
02:04:06.261 --> 02:04:10.640
<v Speaker 2>But I'm very skeptical about people that just let Parsha tail tears in</v>

5163
02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:11.474
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] here.</v>

5164
02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:12.261
<v Speaker 2>Cause I feel like,</v>

5165
02:04:12.261 --> 02:04:12.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5166
02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:13.191
<v Speaker 2>you let it heal,</v>

5167
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>but it healed with like 60% of its original strength.</v>

5168
02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you might have led and heal,</v>

5169
02:04:18.681 --> 02:04:20.210
<v Speaker 2>but how much did you know there's a weakness?</v>

5170
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5171
02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:21.830
<v Speaker 2>You know what they're doing now,</v>

5172
02:04:21.831 --> 02:04:22.760
<v Speaker 2>which is really fascinating.</v>

5173
02:04:22.761 --> 02:04:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Dr Roddy Mcgee out of Las Vegas,</v>

5174
02:04:25.161 --> 02:04:27.140
<v Speaker 2>who does a lot of work with UFC fighters,</v>

5175
02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:32.270
<v Speaker 2>he's showing me that they're taking torn ACL is completely torn and instead of</v>

5176
02:04:32.271 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 2>replacing it now with a cadaver graft or Patella tendon graft,</v>

5177
02:04:35.690 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>they actually take that ligament and can reattach it.</v>

5178
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

5179
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And in three months they had someone competing in the Olympics.</v>

5180
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5181
02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5182
02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:44.630
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

5183
02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Rati Magee.</v>

5184
02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5185
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:47.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5186
02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Cutting edge.</v>

5187
02:04:48.010 --> 02:04:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Ms here in the u s Yup.</v>

5188
02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Widest and greatest.</v>

5189
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And they're doing it.</v>

5190
02:04:51.541 --> 02:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy operation.</v>

5191
02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:56.700
<v Speaker 2>They're taking this broken ligament and they obviously have to do it quick</v>

5192
02:04:56.701 --> 02:04:59.250
<v Speaker 2>before it pulls back and disintegrates.</v>

5193
02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:01.740
<v Speaker 2>But when it gets to the,</v>

5194
02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:02.730
<v Speaker 2>they get the torrent,</v>

5195
02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:03.653
<v Speaker 2>the tear in it,</v>

5196
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:05.180
<v Speaker 2>they reattach it and they,</v>

5197
02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:06.600
<v Speaker 2>so the shit out of this thing,</v>

5198
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:10.050
<v Speaker 2>they've got like stitches in it and it's all weirdly bound up.</v>

5199
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:15.230
<v Speaker 2>And then it reattaches if reattaches and actually grows your original ligament</v>

5200
02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:16.410
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

5201
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:17.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

5202
02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:17.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5203
02:05:18.130 --> 02:05:20.400
<v Speaker 2>that your body can reject or something that you're,</v>

5204
02:05:20.401 --> 02:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5205
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to compromise your patella tendon,</v>

5206
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:23.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5207
02:05:23.701 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how George had his done.</v>

5208
02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Did he do the Patella tendon graft?</v>

5209
02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you did with one of them.</v>

5210
02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] they don't have a string of,</v>

5211
02:05:30.841 --> 02:05:31.674
<v Speaker 2>can't remember.</v>

5212
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.131
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

5213
02:05:32.131 --> 02:05:33.030
<v Speaker 2>he didn't take ever,</v>

5214
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.340
<v Speaker 2>he took his own to do it both ways.</v>

5215
02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Both Times the same way?</v>

5216
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:37.981
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

5217
02:05:37.981 --> 02:05:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5218
02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

5219
02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5220
02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:40.133
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correct,</v>

5221
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

5222
02:05:41.210 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5223
02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Matt Brown just did a hamstring.</v>

5224
02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>He just had his done and they did a hamstring and he said it's,</v>

5225
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.780
<v Speaker 2>he feels pretty good already.</v>

5226
02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5227
02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:50.483
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5228
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5229
02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:51.993
<v Speaker 2>it's scary injury.</v>

5230
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5231
02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:53.543
<v Speaker 2>I've had bolt on.</v>

5232
02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:53.971
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5233
02:05:53.971 --> 02:05:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5234
02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I've had a one with a patella tendon graft and one with a cadaver.</v>

5235
02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:59.130
<v Speaker 2>The cadaver was much easier for me.</v>

5236
02:05:59.150 --> 02:05:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5237
02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5238
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:01.013
<v Speaker 2>It took,</v>

5239
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:02.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5240
02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the thing about it taking,</v>

5241
02:06:04.351 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not taking the idea.</v>

5242
02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 2>What happens with the cadaver is people think that you're,</v>

5243
02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.650
<v Speaker 2>your body takes it like an artificial heart.</v>

5244
02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:11.671
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

5245
02:06:11.671 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Or like a,</v>

5246
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:12.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5247
02:06:12.521 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 2>a transplanted heart.</v>

5248
02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>It actually uses it as a scaffolding to re proliferate with your own cells.</v>

5249
02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:23.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of the problem is it gives you the feeling that it's stronger</v>

5250
02:06:23.701 --> 02:06:25.410
<v Speaker 2>than it is early on you're like,</v>

5251
02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5252
02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:26.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>

5253
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:27.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>

5254
02:06:27.301 --> 02:06:28.080
<v Speaker 2>And you start,</v>

5255
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you mean everybody wants to start rolling again?</v>

5256
02:06:30.151 --> 02:06:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to start training again.</v>

5257
02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:35.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I think some guys just get in there a little bit too early and they do</v>

5258
02:06:35.461 --> 02:06:37.410
<v Speaker 2>something and it pops and they go,</v>

5259
02:06:37.411 --> 02:06:37.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5260
02:06:37.591 --> 02:06:39.120
<v Speaker 2>it didn't take well.</v>

5261
02:06:39.121 --> 02:06:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Is that really the case or did you just put too much stress on it too early on?</v>

5262
02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought the fear was it can reject your body,</v>

5263
02:06:46.861 --> 02:06:47.694
<v Speaker 2>can reject it.</v>

5264
02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of that,</v>

5265
02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:50.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's extremely rare.</v>

5266
02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5267
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I think what,</v>

5268
02:06:51.450 --> 02:06:56.450
<v Speaker 2>what's more common is that they say it doesn't take like that it didn't,</v>

5269
02:06:57.091 --> 02:07:00.000
<v Speaker 2>but I think what I hear it from MMA guys,</v>

5270
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.331
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

5271
02:07:00.331 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I know you are a meathead.</v>

5272
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys are savages.</v>

5273
02:07:04.051 --> 02:07:08.310
<v Speaker 2>You get in there and you're training hard way earlier than you should be and</v>

5274
02:07:08.311 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 2>then it fucks up again.</v>

5275
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5276
02:07:09.850 --> 02:07:13.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of guys that have got an ACL surgery and then in the recovery</v>

5277
02:07:13.831 --> 02:07:15.150
<v Speaker 2>process blew it out again.</v>

5278
02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:18.450
<v Speaker 2>It happens really common and then they're back to square one again.</v>

5279
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:19.583
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5280
02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:20.521
<v Speaker 2>It's all narratives.</v>

5281
02:07:20.521 --> 02:07:20.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5282
02:07:20.701 --> 02:07:21.031
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

5283
02:07:21.031 --> 02:07:21.690
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

5284
02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:22.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean to,</v>

5285
02:07:22.261 --> 02:07:23.340
<v Speaker 2>to explain something,</v>

5286
02:07:23.341 --> 02:07:23.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5287
02:07:23.970 --> 02:07:24.930
<v Speaker 2>it's really just,</v>

5288
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:26.110
<v Speaker 2>it's narrative.</v>

5289
02:07:26.110 --> 02:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what our explanations are 99% of the time.</v>

5290
02:07:28.921 --> 02:07:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Just narratives and then to weed out narratives and not use them.</v>

5291
02:07:31.531 --> 02:07:32.364
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>

5292
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.170
<v Speaker 2>What household,</v>

5293
02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:34.003
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

5294
02:07:34.190 --> 02:07:34.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5295
02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are differences between</v>

5296
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:37.690
<v Speaker 4>logical arguments,</v>

5297
02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:39.400
<v Speaker 4>empirical observations,</v>

5298
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 4>and then there are narratives.</v>

5299
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:44.050
<v Speaker 4>We tell ourselves why things are happening around this all the time.</v>

5300
02:07:44.051 --> 02:07:45.820
<v Speaker 4>And it's 99% of the time it's wrong.</v>

5301
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.683
<v Speaker 4>But we believe it.</v>

5302
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:47.710
<v Speaker 4>We tell ourselves that.</v>

5303
02:07:47.711 --> 02:07:49.010
<v Speaker 4>And to try to work around that is,</v>

5304
02:07:49.011 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 4>is actually quite difficult.</v>

5305
02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:51.490
<v Speaker 4>So like for instance,</v>

5306
02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:52.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5307
02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

5308
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 4>when the field of philosophy and if you give an argument,</v>

5309
02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 4>if you give a deductive argument,</v>

5310
02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 4>your argument has to conclude the conclusion has to have no other possibility.</v>

5311
02:08:00.230 --> 02:08:01.570
<v Speaker 4>It can be no other possibility.</v>

5312
02:08:01.571 --> 02:08:05.680
<v Speaker 4>All your premises have to be valid and sound and there can be no other</v>

5313
02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:06.281
<v Speaker 4>possibility.</v>

5314
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:07.114
<v Speaker 4>When I say,</v>

5315
02:08:07.210 --> 02:08:07.421
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5316
02:08:07.421 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 4>my ligament didn't take,</v>

5317
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.233
<v Speaker 4>there's a thought.</v>

5318
02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:11.320
<v Speaker 4>That's an explanation.</v>

5319
02:08:12.370 --> 02:08:15.280
<v Speaker 4>It's one of many possible narratives.</v>

5320
02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:17.283
<v Speaker 4>It's one of,</v>

5321
02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:18.640
<v Speaker 4>it's one of many,</v>

5322
02:08:18.641 --> 02:08:20.500
<v Speaker 4>many possible explanations I couldn't give.</v>

5323
02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:21.070
<v Speaker 4>Why might,</v>

5324
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:23.800
<v Speaker 4>why my knee's injured now including that you didn't give it,</v>

5325
02:08:23.801 --> 02:08:24.940
<v Speaker 4>let it rest enough.</v>

5326
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.823
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5327
02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 4>Let's say I'm walking and I trip over my shoelaces and maybe like I tripped over</v>

5328
02:08:30.311 --> 02:08:31.144
<v Speaker 4>my shoelaces.</v>

5329
02:08:31.210 --> 02:08:32.043
<v Speaker 4>That's why I felt,</v>

5330
02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:33.161
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5331
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:34.900
<v Speaker 4>you could made if your shoelaces were untied,</v>

5332
02:08:34.901 --> 02:08:36.040
<v Speaker 4>maybe trip anyway.</v>

5333
02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was something else,</v>

5334
02:08:37.091 --> 02:08:37.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5335
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:37.750
<v Speaker 4>You haven't,</v>

5336
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:40.660
<v Speaker 4>you haven't eliminated every other possibility if you haven't eliminated every</v>

5337
02:08:40.661 --> 02:08:41.560
<v Speaker 4>other possibility.</v>

5338
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just a narrative.</v>

5339
02:08:43.570 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 4>It's not actual fact.</v>

5340
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.340
<v Speaker 4>The Tony Ferguson injury was the most fucked up one I've ever,</v>

5341
02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 4>ever right the week of the fight,</v>

5342
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:56.350
<v Speaker 4>press trips on some cables and rips his knee apart.</v>

5343
02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:57.071
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>

5344
02:08:57.071 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 4>He had an injury before.</v>

5345
02:08:58.091 --> 02:08:59.440
<v Speaker 4>He is not aware of you think so.</v>

5346
02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:03.460
<v Speaker 4>There had to be a small rip,</v>

5347
02:09:03.490 --> 02:09:04.301
<v Speaker 4>a small tear,</v>

5348
02:09:04.301 --> 02:09:06.070
<v Speaker 4>a small weakness somewhere.</v>

5349
02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:07.553
<v Speaker 4>Ain't no way he can win.</v>

5350
02:09:07.670 --> 02:09:08.920
<v Speaker 4>He could withstand shipping on a,</v>

5351
02:09:09.130 --> 02:09:09.581
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>

5352
02:09:09.581 --> 02:09:10.240
<v Speaker 4>on a cable,</v>

5353
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:11.890
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it was hanging by a thread.</v>

5354
02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 4>Is that the case or did it,</v>

5355
02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:16.600
<v Speaker 4>did he just followed a really fucked up man?</v>

5356
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:17.560
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see the fall,</v>

5357
02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:22.990
<v Speaker 4>but I assume he's a athletic guy and you could fall in a way he can catch</v>

5358
02:09:22.991 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 4>himself falling in a way that,</v>

5359
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5360
02:09:25.061 --> 02:09:26.410
<v Speaker 4>is his athletic.</v>

5361
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:27.820
<v Speaker 4>He may be,</v>

5362
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:28.240
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

5363
02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:28.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5364
02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:29.434
<v Speaker 4>when you're sparring,</v>

5365
02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:30.191
<v Speaker 4>you hurt yourself.</v>

5366
02:09:30.191 --> 02:09:32.230
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel it so much is going on.</v>

5367
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he hurt himself when he cooled down and he didn't feel it.</v>

5368
02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:35.020
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

5369
02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.820
<v Speaker 4>there's not many pain sensors there or whatnot.</v>

5370
02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

5371
02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:38.163
<v Speaker 4>this is just a narrative,</v>

5372
02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:38.531
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5373
02:09:38.531 --> 02:09:39.160
<v Speaker 4>Then he goes in there,</v>

5374
02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:40.000
<v Speaker 4>it's hanging by a thread.</v>

5375
02:09:40.001 --> 02:09:40.810
<v Speaker 4>He tugs it,</v>

5376
02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:41.110
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

5377
02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:41.980
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing breaks apart,</v>

5378
02:09:41.981 --> 02:09:42.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5379
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:43.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5380
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:43.691
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5381
02:09:43.691 --> 02:09:44.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a possibility.</v>

5382
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 4>It's such a violent injury.</v>

5383
02:09:46.331 --> 02:09:47.620
<v Speaker 4>If you see how bad it was.</v>

5384
02:09:47.890 --> 02:09:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the surgery photos?</v>

5385
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:49.871
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>

5386
02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:52.100
<v Speaker 4>I saw actually a little bit the craziest photos I've ever seen.</v>

5387
02:09:52.101 --> 02:09:52.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean his,</v>

5388
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:57.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking enormous scar to have that kind of a scar in 2018 while the</v>

5389
02:09:57.601 --> 02:09:59.110
<v Speaker 4>surgery techniques they have today.</v>

5390
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.050
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare that you see someone who's just,</v>

5391
02:10:02.051 --> 02:10:02.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

5392
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:05.170
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at like a 12 inch scar really?</v>

5393
02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:05.741
<v Speaker 4>That I didn't see,</v>

5394
02:10:05.741 --> 02:10:06.231
<v Speaker 4>I just saw him.</v>

5395
02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.600
<v Speaker 4>He posted an Oh my God.</v>

5396
02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:08.770
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5397
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:09.670
<v Speaker 4>That's huge.</v>

5398
02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:10.301
<v Speaker 4>It's credible.</v>

5399
02:10:10.301 --> 02:10:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

5400
02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:15.780
<v Speaker 4>that is a giant scar goes well below his knee to above the knee and they opened</v>

5401
02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:17.651
<v Speaker 4>him up.</v>

5402
02:10:17.651 --> 02:10:18.760
<v Speaker 4>And what does this,</v>

5403
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 4>is this pre surgery?</v>

5404
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:21.360
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>

5405
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.530
<v Speaker 4>so this is just different angles at ACL.</v>

5406
02:10:23.531 --> 02:10:23.921
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

5407
02:10:23.921 --> 02:10:24.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5408
02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:26.050
<v Speaker 4>his MCL.</v>

5409
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.810
<v Speaker 4>A PCL out.</v>

5410
02:10:27.811 --> 02:10:29.530
<v Speaker 4>Which one is on the outside?</v>

5411
02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:30.700
<v Speaker 4>Outside is MCL.</v>

5412
02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.350
<v Speaker 4>So as MCL was ripped,</v>

5413
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 4>completely bone.</v>

5414
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:35.743
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5415
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:37.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5416
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:38.000
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5417
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:38.790
<v Speaker 2>What Gilda?</v>

5418
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>His Twitter is Instagram page.</v>

5419
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Now does he have,</v>

5420
02:10:42.681 --> 02:10:43.514
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5421
02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:46.850
<v Speaker 2>and the updates because a guy like that,</v>

5422
02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you gotta wonder like,</v>

5423
02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:51.920
<v Speaker 2>when is he going photo I saw the one with the Suction Cup is copping.</v>

5424
02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>

5425
02:10:53.090 --> 02:10:53.923
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

5426
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was just having a conversation with someone who was it that just say a</v>

5427
02:10:56.781 --> 02:10:57.650
<v Speaker 2>cup and was bullshit.</v>

5428
02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:58.513
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

5429
02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 2>was it,</v>

5430
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 2>I was having a conversation with someone.</v>

5431
02:11:02.331 --> 02:11:05.900
<v Speaker 2>They're saying cupping is essentially almost total nonsense,</v>

5432
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>but so many people do it and it just puts your mind that you're doing something</v>

5433
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:11.990
<v Speaker 2>and healing and doing something,</v>

5434
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:13.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5435
02:11:13.071 --> 02:11:18.071
<v Speaker 2>addition in addition to standard procedures to that that's helping you out but</v>

5436
02:11:18.330 --> 02:11:19.310
<v Speaker 2>really ain't doing shit.</v>

5437
02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:20.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5438
02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:21.601
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

5439
02:11:21.601 --> 02:11:21.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5440
02:11:21.691 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 2>it's probably more psychological,</v>

5441
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:25.070
<v Speaker 2>but everybody does it.</v>

5442
02:11:25.330 --> 02:11:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5443
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:26.031
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

5444
02:11:26.031 --> 02:11:26.781
<v Speaker 2>It's like a logical,</v>

5445
02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:29.150
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you're taking care of yourself and it makes you feel good.</v>

5446
02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:29.990
<v Speaker 2>It's psychosomatic.</v>

5447
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because back up,</v>

5448
02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:32.540
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

5449
02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:33.830
<v Speaker 2>go back up to that image of Jamie.</v>

5450
02:11:34.450 --> 02:11:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5451
02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:35.230
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

5452
02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:36.063
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

5453
02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:37.850
<v Speaker 2>That is fucking crazy looking.</v>

5454
02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.193
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

5455
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:40.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5456
02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:41.031
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5457
02:11:41.031 --> 02:11:41.511
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

5458
02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:44.360
<v Speaker 2>psychosomatic medicine can help you.</v>

5459
02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:45.190
<v Speaker 2>But hearsay,</v>

5460
02:11:45.190 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 2>an insurance covers acupuncture treatment because it's effective.</v>

5461
02:11:48.171 --> 02:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>I was skeptical the first time I tried it,</v>

5462
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:51.460
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

5463
02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:51.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5464
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:52.101
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

5465
02:11:52.101 --> 02:11:52.934
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5466
02:11:53.490 --> 02:11:54.860
<v Speaker 2>You are a complete moron then.</v>

5467
02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Even insurance covers acupuncture.</v>

5468
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.843
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5469
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.070
<v Speaker 2>does acupuncture work?</v>

5470
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:02.223
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

5471
02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:03.261
<v Speaker 2>Never tested.</v>

5472
02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:04.094
<v Speaker 2>Never fucked with it.</v>

5473
02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 2>I've had it done to me.</v>

5474
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I didn't particularly enjoyed it.</v>

5475
02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5476
02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:09.680
<v Speaker 2>I only had it done once and the guy was kind of acquired.</v>

5477
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5478
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.090
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

5479
02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:11.923
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

5480
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:12.280
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

5481
02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:13.970
<v Speaker 2>once they start talking about toxins,</v>

5482
02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5483
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:16.310
<v Speaker 2>we're cleansing you toxins.</v>

5484
02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5485
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:17.241
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5486
02:12:17.241 --> 02:12:18.074
<v Speaker 2>that's a narrative.</v>

5487
02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5488
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:19.303
<v Speaker 2>Possible.</v>

5489
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Let's not prove it.</v>

5490
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.741
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5491
02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:22.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a possible story you told yourself.</v>

5492
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5493
02:12:22.791 --> 02:12:27.260
<v Speaker 2>But that term toxins is so that that is like,</v>

5494
02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things that people say,</v>

5495
02:12:29.421 --> 02:12:29.571
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5496
02:12:29.571 --> 02:12:30.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5497
02:12:30.201 --> 02:12:31.470
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a woo,</v>

5498
02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:31.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5499
02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:33.830
<v Speaker 2>this is some bullshit here.</v>

5500
02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:35.180
<v Speaker 2>And toxins is one of them.</v>

5501
02:12:35.181 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Cleansing and toxins.</v>

5502
02:12:36.921 --> 02:12:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm going into a class and I'm,</v>

5503
02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting the toxins out of my system.</v>

5504
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:45.800
<v Speaker 2>The scientists are just as guilty as of Wu is every other guy.</v>

5505
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

5506
02:12:46.330 --> 02:12:47.163
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5507
02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

5508
02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:48.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

5509
02:12:48.951 --> 02:12:49.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5510
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:49.981
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

5511
02:12:49.981 --> 02:12:50.721
<v Speaker 2>there's scientists,</v>

5512
02:12:50.721 --> 02:12:52.280
<v Speaker 2>then there's philosophers of science.</v>

5513
02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:55.580
<v Speaker 2>There's so much Wu in science,</v>

5514
02:12:55.581 --> 02:12:57.500
<v Speaker 2>even the most popular guys have woo.</v>

5515
02:12:57.530 --> 02:12:59.480
<v Speaker 2>They just never studied the philosophy of science.</v>

5516
02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:01.490
<v Speaker 2>So they don't really understand what they're saying per say.</v>

5517
02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:01.851
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5518
02:13:01.851 --> 02:13:03.140
<v Speaker 2>give me an example of wounds.</v>

5519
02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you,</v>

5520
02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.161
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a great,</v>

5521
02:13:04.161 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 2>he's okay.</v>

5522
02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:05.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5523
02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.553
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5524
02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:08.510
<v Speaker 2>there's this guy named Isaac Newton.</v>

5525
02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5526
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I heard of that dude.</v>

5527
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:10.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5528
02:13:10.401 --> 02:13:11.121
<v Speaker 2>And you're asking him,</v>

5529
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Hey Isaac,</v>

5530
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:13.430
<v Speaker 2>why don't I fall off the face of the earth?</v>

5531
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:14.541
<v Speaker 2>And he's going to be like,</v>

5532
02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:14.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5533
02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:15.554
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

5534
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 2>there's this gravity.</v>

5535
02:13:16.851 --> 02:13:19.040
<v Speaker 2>This is the force of gravity pulling you down to the earth.</v>

5536
02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:20.690
<v Speaker 2>The earth has a greater mass than you.</v>

5537
02:13:20.691 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Therefore it's,</v>

5538
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:22.970
<v Speaker 2>there's this force pulling you down.</v>

5539
02:13:22.971 --> 02:13:23.804
<v Speaker 2>We call it gravity.</v>

5540
02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 2>And then some guy comes around,</v>

5541
02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:26.101
<v Speaker 2>his name is,</v>

5542
02:13:26.101 --> 02:13:26.541
<v Speaker 2>is a hobby.</v>

5543
02:13:26.541 --> 02:13:26.841
<v Speaker 2>And he tells,</v>

5544
02:13:26.841 --> 02:13:27.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5545
02:13:27.171 --> 02:13:27.371
<v Speaker 2>Joel,</v>

5546
02:13:27.371 --> 02:13:28.204
<v Speaker 2>don't listen to that guy.</v>

5547
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I have another theory.</v>

5548
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Way more that's</v>

5549
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:32.933
<v Speaker 5>shorter than his.</v>

5550
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 5>I believe there are gremlins pulling it down to the earth.</v>

5551
02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.351
<v Speaker 5>They have last holes.</v>

5552
02:13:37.351 --> 02:13:37.941
<v Speaker 5>He's infinite.</v>

5553
02:13:37.941 --> 02:13:38.611
<v Speaker 5>Long last was,</v>

5554
02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:39.600
<v Speaker 5>and every time you're falling off the,</v>

5555
02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:40.231
<v Speaker 5>if they pull you,</v>

5556
02:13:40.231 --> 02:13:41.820
<v Speaker 5>every time you jump up and down on the earth,</v>

5557
02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:43.620
<v Speaker 5>they pull you back down to the earth.</v>

5558
02:13:43.621 --> 02:13:45.090
<v Speaker 5>You don't see these gremlins are invisible,</v>

5559
02:13:45.091 --> 02:13:46.560
<v Speaker 5>but that's what's pulling you down to the earth.</v>

5560
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:47.881
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

5561
02:13:47.881 --> 02:13:49.230
<v Speaker 5>how do you know who's right and who's wrong?</v>

5562
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 5>Who's telling you the truth?</v>

5563
02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:51.714
<v Speaker 5>Mere Isaac.</v>

5564
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:53.003
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5565
02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:57.780
<v Speaker 5>Isaac lived a long time ago before they actually had provable studies that could</v>

5566
02:13:57.781 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 5>show you why gravity works.</v>

5567
02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:01.230
<v Speaker 5>Naming one of those studies.</v>

5568
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:01.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5569
02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:02.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a scientist.</v>

5570
02:14:02.461 --> 02:14:02.671
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5571
02:14:02.671 --> 02:14:03.110
<v Speaker 5>No side.</v>

5572
02:14:03.110 --> 02:14:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>

5573
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:04.350
<v Speaker 5>let me break it to you this way.</v>

5574
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 5>No scientist has a study to prove us that gravity works.</v>

5575
02:14:07.610 --> 02:14:07.870
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

5576
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:08.641
<v Speaker 5>that's the whole thing.</v>

5577
02:14:08.641 --> 02:14:08.831
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

5578
02:14:08.831 --> 02:14:09.930
<v Speaker 5>that's what's scary about.</v>

5579
02:14:10.230 --> 02:14:14.400
<v Speaker 5>But can you talk about the universal and understand that gravity is in relation</v>

5580
02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:16.500
<v Speaker 5>to the size and mass of objects.</v>

5581
02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:18.000
<v Speaker 5>So the moon is smaller,</v>

5582
02:14:18.001 --> 02:14:21.420
<v Speaker 5>therefore it has one six earth's gravity cause it's one quarter the size of the</v>

5583
02:14:21.421 --> 02:14:21.810
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

5584
02:14:21.810 --> 02:14:23.790
<v Speaker 5>There's a standard formula that you follow.</v>

5585
02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:24.653
<v Speaker 5>There's a correlation.</v>

5586
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:25.770
<v Speaker 5>Now My,</v>

5587
02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:26.940
<v Speaker 5>my theory of Gremlins,</v>

5588
02:14:26.941 --> 02:14:28.430
<v Speaker 5>which obviously I don't believe in,</v>

5589
02:14:28.431 --> 02:14:28.591
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5590
02:14:28.591 --> 02:14:31.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm using the theological language to make it really sip though.</v>

5591
02:14:31.381 --> 02:14:33.080
<v Speaker 5>Somebody misquote me that I've even really know</v>

5592
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.560
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't believe in gravity is gravity denier.</v>

5593
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:38.633
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5594
02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:39.653
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5595
02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:40.320
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

5596
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:40.830
<v Speaker 5>there's less.</v>

5597
02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:41.663
<v Speaker 5>There's less mass.</v>

5598
02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:42.630
<v Speaker 5>There's less Adams.</v>

5599
02:14:42.930 --> 02:14:43.970
<v Speaker 5>The moon has less Adams.</v>

5600
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Therefore less Gremlin.</v>

5601
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Lesser than pulling.</v>

5602
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:46.570
<v Speaker 5>You might.</v>

5603
02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 5>My gremlin theory correlates with the gravity theory.</v>

5604
02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:51.023
<v Speaker 5>Exactly,</v>

5605
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:52.380
<v Speaker 5>but I'm using a myth,</v>

5606
02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:53.161
<v Speaker 5>mythical language.</v>

5607
02:14:53.161 --> 02:14:58.161
<v Speaker 5>Just to point out that every type of force we're talking about is an inference.</v>

5608
02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:00.240
<v Speaker 5>It's something we project out there.</v>

5609
02:15:00.241 --> 02:15:02.880
<v Speaker 5>We don't actually see gravity and you know later on,</v>

5610
02:15:02.881 --> 02:15:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Einstein debunked gravity,</v>

5611
02:15:04.021 --> 02:15:04.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5612
02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:05.070
<v Speaker 5>When?</v>

5613
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:06.910
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean by he dunk gravity?</v>

5614
02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:08.010
<v Speaker 5>Isaac was totally wrong.</v>

5615
02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.610
<v Speaker 5>I think explanation of why you don't fall off the earth was totally wrong.</v>

5616
02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:12.960
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5617
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 5>what did Einstein due to debunk it?</v>

5618
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:20.390
<v Speaker 5>Einstein taught us that a new theory and new hypothesis that gravity's a pushing</v>

5619
02:15:20.581 --> 02:15:20.851
<v Speaker 5>force,</v>

5620
02:15:20.851 --> 02:15:21.840
<v Speaker 5>not a pulling force.</v>

5621
02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:24.540
<v Speaker 5>See Isaac Newton,</v>

5622
02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:26.340
<v Speaker 5>he debunked Aristotle</v>

5623
02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:29.251
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

5624
02:15:29.251 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 5>We to believe what Aristotle used to say.</v>

5625
02:15:30.631 --> 02:15:31.321
<v Speaker 5>I was starting to say,</v>

5626
02:15:31.321 --> 02:15:31.980
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5627
02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:35.910
<v Speaker 5>this thing has a natural place.</v>

5628
02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:36.990
<v Speaker 5>It has to be stuck to the earth.</v>

5629
02:15:36.991 --> 02:15:39.780
<v Speaker 5>That's just natural place it the forces within that one thing.</v>

5630
02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:41.720
<v Speaker 5>That's why it doesn't fall off theorists.</v>

5631
02:15:41.770 --> 02:15:43.890
<v Speaker 5>So when Aristotle saw bird fly,</v>

5632
02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:44.761
<v Speaker 5>he said it,</v>

5633
02:15:44.761 --> 02:15:44.911
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5634
02:15:44.911 --> 02:15:45.744
<v Speaker 5>it has levity.</v>

5635
02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:48.000
<v Speaker 5>It's natural state is to be in the air.</v>

5636
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:49.980
<v Speaker 5>The force that carries it up in the air,</v>

5637
02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:50.814
<v Speaker 5>it's within it.</v>

5638
02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.470
<v Speaker 5>Within the bird itself.</v>

5639
02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:54.540
<v Speaker 5>Isaac Newton came around and said,</v>

5640
02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:54.691
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5641
02:15:54.691 --> 02:15:55.524
<v Speaker 5>that's totally wrong.</v>

5642
02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.611
<v Speaker 5>Nobody,</v>

5643
02:15:56.611 --> 02:15:57.000
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5644
02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.770
<v Speaker 5>no entity can move itself.</v>

5645
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:01.170
<v Speaker 5>It's only a force that's applied.</v>

5646
02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.080
<v Speaker 5>So let's say you're walking Isaac Newton would say you're not pushing yourself</v>

5647
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:04.860
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>

5648
02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:08.220
<v Speaker 5>You're pushing the ground beneath you backwards</v>

5649
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:14.430
<v Speaker 5>and that the ground is pushing you forwards so that every action has an</v>

5650
02:16:14.431 --> 02:16:14.670
<v Speaker 5>opposite,</v>

5651
02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:15.503
<v Speaker 5>equal reaction.</v>

5652
02:16:16.050 --> 02:16:16.801
<v Speaker 5>So when I run,</v>

5653
02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:18.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm really pushing the ground behind me.</v>

5654
02:16:18.181 --> 02:16:19.014
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like,</v>

5655
02:16:19.290 --> 02:16:20.160
<v Speaker 5>like he's splitting hairs,</v>

5656
02:16:20.161 --> 02:16:21.600
<v Speaker 5>but he's saying something actually very profound.</v>

5657
02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.411
<v Speaker 5>He saying,</v>

5658
02:16:22.411 --> 02:16:25.410
<v Speaker 5>you're pushing the earth behind you and the earth is pushing you forward.</v>

5659
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:26.310
<v Speaker 5>There's a reaction there.</v>

5660
02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:27.141
<v Speaker 5>So what they do to,</v>

5661
02:16:27.141 --> 02:16:29.920
<v Speaker 5>to illustrate that to kids is they take like a train track,</v>

5662
02:16:29.921 --> 02:16:31.570
<v Speaker 5>the elevated and the turn on the train,</v>

5663
02:16:31.810 --> 02:16:34.990
<v Speaker 5>and then you see the train tracks don't spin underneath the train.</v>

5664
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:36.291
<v Speaker 5>And it's showing you look,</v>

5665
02:16:36.291 --> 02:16:40.690
<v Speaker 5>the train is pushing the train tracks back and the train tracks are pushing the</v>

5666
02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:41.590
<v Speaker 5>train forward when they're,</v>

5667
02:16:41.591 --> 02:16:42.940
<v Speaker 5>when they're connected to the ground.</v>

5668
02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:43.691
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

5669
02:16:43.691 --> 02:16:44.740
<v Speaker 5>when I put you on a treadmill,</v>

5670
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 5>you're pushing the treadmill behind you,</v>

5671
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:49.780
<v Speaker 5>the treadmill's not pushing you forward because it's,</v>

5672
02:16:49.781 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 5>it's spinning along with you.</v>

5673
02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 5>And if I put you on the ground,</v>

5674
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:54.190
<v Speaker 5>the ground is pushing you forward now,</v>

5675
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:56.590
<v Speaker 5>so for every action has an opposite,</v>

5676
02:16:56.591 --> 02:16:57.131
<v Speaker 5>equal reaction.</v>

5677
02:16:57.131 --> 02:16:57.964
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you heard this.</v>

5678
02:16:58.750 --> 02:16:59.920
<v Speaker 5>Then Einstein comes along and says,</v>

5679
02:16:59.930 --> 02:17:00.051
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5680
02:17:00.051 --> 02:17:02.350
<v Speaker 5>that's totally wrong when it comes to gravity.</v>

5681
02:17:02.410 --> 02:17:02.561
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

5682
02:17:02.561 --> 02:17:04.030
<v Speaker 5>When subject to gravity says,</v>

5683
02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:05.530
<v Speaker 5>because Isaac Newton says this,</v>

5684
02:17:05.531 --> 02:17:05.681
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5685
02:17:05.681 --> 02:17:05.921
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

5686
02:17:05.921 --> 02:17:06.101
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5687
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 5>the force of gravity is in the earth.</v>

5688
02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:09.760
<v Speaker 5>The earth has this invisible force,</v>

5689
02:17:09.761 --> 02:17:11.170
<v Speaker 5>this magical wool thing.</v>

5690
02:17:11.171 --> 02:17:11.920
<v Speaker 5>And that's what,</v>

5691
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:13.390
<v Speaker 5>that's what is contemporary set about him.</v>

5692
02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:14.680
<v Speaker 5>That's what his pure said.</v>

5693
02:17:14.681 --> 02:17:14.920
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

5694
02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.780
<v Speaker 5>all you're appealing to magic.</v>

5695
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:18.310
<v Speaker 5>What is gravity thing where it's not,</v>

5696
02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:19.360
<v Speaker 5>it's not comparable.</v>

5697
02:17:19.361 --> 02:17:20.290
<v Speaker 5>It's not material.</v>

5698
02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not made of a substance is this magic.</v>

5699
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:23.681
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

5700
02:17:23.681 --> 02:17:23.921
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5701
02:17:23.921 --> 02:17:24.610
<v Speaker 5>it's this forced.</v>

5702
02:17:24.610 --> 02:17:25.151
<v Speaker 5>You can't feel it.</v>

5703
02:17:25.151 --> 02:17:25.901
<v Speaker 5>You can detect it.</v>

5704
02:17:25.901 --> 02:17:30.901
<v Speaker 5>It's just observable in the nature and for 300 years everybody believed that and</v>

5705
02:17:31.271 --> 02:17:32.860
<v Speaker 5>then I think as long says no,</v>

5706
02:17:32.861 --> 02:17:33.820
<v Speaker 5>you guys are totally wrong.</v>

5707
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 5>There is no mythical force called gravity.</v>

5708
02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:37.540
<v Speaker 5>It's a pushing force.</v>

5709
02:17:37.541 --> 02:17:39.190
<v Speaker 5>So really what he says is,</v>

5710
02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:39.940
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

5711
02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:40.151
<v Speaker 5>let me,</v>

5712
02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.200
<v Speaker 5>let me get a sheet of paper here.</v>

5713
02:17:41.410 --> 02:17:41.921
<v Speaker 5>Make a really,</v>

5714
02:17:41.921 --> 02:17:42.520
<v Speaker 5>really simple,</v>

5715
02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.170
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to put it in a nutshell here.</v>

5716
02:17:44.171 --> 02:17:44.351
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5717
02:17:44.351 --> 02:17:45.184
<v Speaker 5>But okay,</v>

5718
02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:46.180
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

5719
02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:46.541
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

5720
02:17:46.541 --> 02:17:46.691
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5721
02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:47.530
<v Speaker 5>I just says look,</v>

5722
02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 5>space and time are one space is actually a thing out there.</v>

5723
02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:53.190
<v Speaker 5>It's actually a fee.</v>

5724
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:55.570
<v Speaker 5>The space between me and you is the actual physical thing.</v>

5725
02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.150
<v Speaker 5>He says the sun is so heavy that it dents it,</v>

5726
02:17:58.170 --> 02:17:58.680
<v Speaker 5>that makes it,</v>

5727
02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 5>it makes like a totally the bowl and the earth is bumping around in that toilet</v>

5728
02:18:02.291 --> 02:18:04.570
<v Speaker 5>bowl because space is actually curved.</v>

5729
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:07.960
<v Speaker 5>It's curved like this spaces curve because the sun,</v>

5730
02:18:07.961 --> 02:18:08.794
<v Speaker 5>Imagine I put something,</v>

5731
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.790
<v Speaker 5>a bowling ball on your bed.</v>

5732
02:18:09.810 --> 02:18:09.941
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

5733
02:18:09.941 --> 02:18:10.380
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

5734
02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:13.090
<v Speaker 5>your bed's going to indent that bolt,</v>

5735
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.550
<v Speaker 5>that toilet bowl shape the world.</v>

5736
02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:17.420
<v Speaker 5>The earth is flooring around that toilet bowl shape.</v>

5737
02:18:17.421 --> 02:18:18.400
<v Speaker 5>So it's a pushing force.</v>

5738
02:18:18.401 --> 02:18:19.630
<v Speaker 5>No longer a pulling force.</v>

5739
02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:24.670
<v Speaker 5>So the weight of the earth is pushing down on space.</v>

5740
02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:25.121
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5741
02:18:25.121 --> 02:18:26.050
<v Speaker 5>It's bending space.</v>

5742
02:18:26.051 --> 02:18:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Literally it's masses bending space.</v>

5743
02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:31.390
<v Speaker 5>Now Isaac Newton thought light travels in a straight line only.</v>

5744
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:33.070
<v Speaker 5>And to prove this,</v>

5745
02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:33.611
<v Speaker 5>Einstein said,</v>

5746
02:18:33.611 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

5747
02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 5>light will bend if I'm right.</v>

5748
02:18:36.551 --> 02:18:37.390
<v Speaker 5>Light Bend.</v>

5749
02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:40.330
<v Speaker 5>So they observe the sun during an eclipse and they saw that the light bends</v>

5750
02:18:40.331 --> 02:18:41.710
<v Speaker 5>light does not travel in a straight line.</v>

5751
02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:42.573
<v Speaker 5>This was another,</v>

5752
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.390
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5753
02:18:43.390 --> 02:18:43.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5754
02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:44.610
<v Speaker 5>belief there was debunked.</v>

5755
02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:44.831
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5756
02:18:44.831 --> 02:18:49.831
<v Speaker 5>how many scientific beliefs are debunked countless or overturned because a</v>

5757
02:18:50.081 --> 02:18:52.110
<v Speaker 5>scientific fact is not a mathematical fact.</v>

5758
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:56.590
<v Speaker 5>They're two different things as scientific fact and never go higher than</v>

5759
02:18:56.591 --> 02:18:57.424
<v Speaker 5>hypothesis.</v>

5760
02:18:58.150 --> 02:19:00.490
<v Speaker 5>If somebody understands the philosophy of science,</v>

5761
02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:05.410
<v Speaker 5>he understands that every single scientific fact is not equivalent to a</v>

5762
02:19:05.411 --> 02:19:06.310
<v Speaker 5>mathematical fact.</v>

5763
02:19:06.311 --> 02:19:11.311
<v Speaker 5>One plus one equals to a scientific fact is always subject to cross examination</v>

5764
02:19:12.431 --> 02:19:13.250
<v Speaker 5>and new evidence.</v>

5765
02:19:13.250 --> 02:19:13.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5766
02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.940
<v Speaker 5>you've ever heard of Thomas Kuhn is very famous for that,</v>

5767
02:19:15.941 --> 02:19:16.091
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5768
02:19:16.091 --> 02:19:16.990
<v Speaker 5>We have a paradigm.</v>

5769
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:19.840
<v Speaker 5>So during Aristotle's time he had a paradigm.</v>

5770
02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:21.130
<v Speaker 5>You thought the sun goes around the earth.</v>

5771
02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.570
<v Speaker 5>It was an observational,</v>

5772
02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:23.860
<v Speaker 5>scientific fact.</v>

5773
02:19:23.890 --> 02:19:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Everyday he saw the sun go around the earth.</v>

5774
02:19:25.631 --> 02:19:26.464
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>

5775
02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:26.711
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

5776
02:19:26.711 --> 02:19:27.544
<v Speaker 5>look guys,</v>

5777
02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm</v>

5778
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>using my senses to observe the sun go around the earth.</v>

5779
02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 2>And then one day we find that no,</v>

5780
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 2>that's an optical illusion.</v>

5781
02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:36.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not sure that the sun goes around the earth is the earth goes around the</v>

5782
02:19:36.441 --> 02:19:37.540
<v Speaker 2>sun site.</v>

5783
02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:39.140
<v Speaker 2>They re scientific revolution.</v>

5784
02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Every scientific fact we have,</v>

5785
02:19:41.451 --> 02:19:43.580
<v Speaker 2>or theory including gravity,</v>

5786
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 2>because gravity became the law of gravity.</v>

5787
02:19:45.171 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a longer the theory of gravity,</v>

5788
02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.410
<v Speaker 2>it was so accepted became the law of gravity.</v>

5789
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Today we don't,</v>

5790
02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:52.220
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand gravity as Einstein understood it.</v>

5791
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:52.761
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>

5792
02:19:52.761 --> 02:19:54.110
<v Speaker 2>as Isaac Newton understood it.</v>

5793
02:19:54.111 --> 02:19:55.370
<v Speaker 2>We understand it completely backwards,</v>

5794
02:19:55.371 --> 02:19:56.330
<v Speaker 2>literally backwards now.</v>

5795
02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's true with every scientific theory because science is always subject</v>

5796
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:04.340
<v Speaker 2>to new evidence coming to light or the difference between Isaac Newton living</v>

5797
02:20:04.341 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 2>with when,</v>

5798
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>whenever the fuck he lived a long ass time ago,</v>

5799
02:20:07.251 --> 02:20:10.070
<v Speaker 2>300 years ago versus the science that we're dealing with today.</v>

5800
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a sense today,</v>

5801
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but what we'll,</v>

5802
02:20:11.961 --> 02:20:14.270
<v Speaker 2>we'll do you see in the science of today?</v>

5803
02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Um Oh the biggest culprit.</v>

5804
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5805
02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:17.810
<v Speaker 2>A randomness.</v>

5806
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.951
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

5807
02:20:18.951 --> 02:20:21.620
<v Speaker 2>it's funny cause I heard you just conversation with the Sam Harris on</v>

5808
02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:22.071
<v Speaker 2>randomness,</v>

5809
02:20:22.071 --> 02:20:22.910
<v Speaker 2>which I loved by the way.</v>

5810
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:23.833
<v Speaker 2>You did a great job.</v>

5811
02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.610
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a great conversation.</v>

5812
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:27.650
<v Speaker 2>However he was giving you my opinion.</v>

5813
02:20:27.651 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Two contradictory ideas was tell you,</v>

5814
02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>look the world is determined but also there'll be random events.</v>

5815
02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:36.020
<v Speaker 2>And I found that all he was actually talking about determinism versus free will,</v>

5816
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5817
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5818
02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 2>So the idea being that you don't necessarily have free will that everything</v>

5819
02:20:41.211 --> 02:20:44.270
<v Speaker 2>about your decisions and what you're going to do is based on your life</v>

5820
02:20:44.271 --> 02:20:45.104
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

5821
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:46.070
<v Speaker 2>your genetics,</v>

5822
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.250
<v Speaker 2>all these variables that are essentially out of your control.</v>

5823
02:20:49.310 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So this idea of free will is an illusion,</v>

5824
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 2>which is a really complex conversation.</v>

5825
02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think you could see it in both ways.</v>

5826
02:20:58.011 --> 02:21:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I think you do have a certain amount of control of your decisions.</v>

5827
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:07.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think you were also shaped very much so by your past and your genetics and</v>

5828
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 2>your interpretation of those events.</v>

5829
02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5830
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:13.460
<v Speaker 2>what are those interpretations of those events though?</v>

5831
02:21:13.461 --> 02:21:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And why do you make those determinations?</v>

5832
02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:16.251
<v Speaker 2>W who,</v>

5833
02:21:16.251 --> 02:21:16.980
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

5834
02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:18.500
<v Speaker 2>who's in your head pulling the gears?</v>

5835
02:21:18.501 --> 02:21:19.770
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

5836
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:21.050
<v Speaker 2>What are you,</v>

5837
02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hard determinist like I'm a very hard determinist.</v>

5838
02:21:23.890 --> 02:21:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

5839
02:21:24.610 --> 02:21:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like determinist extremist,</v>

5840
02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 2>so but do you believe in free will?</v>

5841
02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I also believe in free will,</v>

5842
02:21:29.661 --> 02:21:30.200
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

5843
02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:30.830
<v Speaker 2>which is to,</v>

5844
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:31.663
<v Speaker 2>which is tricky.</v>

5845
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5846
02:21:31.930 --> 02:21:32.420
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky,</v>

5847
02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:34.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's what it's true.</v>

5848
02:21:34.611 --> 02:21:36.500
<v Speaker 2>A potting the both further examination.</v>

5849
02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:37.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's,</v>

5850
02:21:37.850 --> 02:21:41.090
<v Speaker 2>there is something that allows people to,</v>

5851
02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:41.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean what,</v>

5852
02:21:41.911 --> 02:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>what takes the guy was 500 pounds and all of sudden he goes on a Keto diet and</v>

5853
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 2>starts running and who starts walking in the knee,</v>

5854
02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 2>he sends you a picture on Twitter.</v>

5855
02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I lost 179 pounds in six months.</v>

5856
02:21:52.071 --> 02:21:52.281
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

5857
02:21:52.281 --> 02:21:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

5858
02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did you do?</v>

5859
02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy has some fucking wheel man to say that.</v>

5860
02:21:57.621 --> 02:22:01.970
<v Speaker 2>That's his whole life and his life experiences and as genetics it's like,</v>

5861
02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:02.930
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

5862
02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I could see what you're saying.</v>

5863
02:22:04.101 --> 02:22:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I could see that he,</v>

5864
02:22:05.430 --> 02:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>he had enough because of his life experiences and that it led to him making this</v>

5865
02:22:09.681 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

5866
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but this is a tremendous amount of will involved in that and to deny that seems</v>

5867
02:22:14.991 --> 02:22:17.420
<v Speaker 2>like you're denying the spirit of human beings.</v>

5868
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5869
02:22:18.291 --> 02:22:19.071
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it this way.</v>

5870
02:22:19.071 --> 02:22:19.281
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5871
02:22:19.281 --> 02:22:19.700
<v Speaker 2>real quick,</v>

5872
02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:20.480
<v Speaker 2>let's look at it like,</v>

5873
02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:20.691
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5874
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:21.950
<v Speaker 2>let's say a couple of this piece of paper</v>

5875
02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:24.860
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to catapult it.</v>

5876
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

5877
02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:27.373
<v Speaker 4>in Atlanta there,</v>

5878
02:22:27.390 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

5879
02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:29.910
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to reset the entire universe.</v>

5880
02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:32.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to reset every molecule there.</v>

5881
02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:34.380
<v Speaker 4>Every fiber in this paper,</v>

5882
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be in the exact same spot.</v>

5883
02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:38.380
<v Speaker 4>The whole universe has been reset and a fire.</v>

5884
02:22:38.381 --> 02:22:39.214
<v Speaker 4>It again,</v>

5885
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:42.570
<v Speaker 4>isn't going to land exactly where it landed the first time,</v>

5886
02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:44.700
<v Speaker 4>or is it going to land somewhere else?</v>

5887
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:46.620
<v Speaker 4>I've reset the universe.</v>

5888
02:22:47.010 --> 02:22:48.570
<v Speaker 4>The earth was the earth.</v>

5889
02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Every molecule of matter in the every,</v>

5890
02:22:51.691 --> 02:22:52.260
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

5891
02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 4>every particle of matter in the universe has been reset with the same amount of</v>

5892
02:22:55.891 --> 02:22:56.520
<v Speaker 4>force.</v>

5893
02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Everything is identical.</v>

5894
02:22:57.691 --> 02:23:01.920
<v Speaker 4>I would assume if the same amount of space and the same amount of air,</v>

5895
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:04.350
<v Speaker 4>you would land the same spot infinitely.</v>

5896
02:23:04.351 --> 02:23:05.184
<v Speaker 4>Precisely.</v>

5897
02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what every set,</v>

5898
02:23:07.651 --> 02:23:08.550
<v Speaker 4>everything perfectly,</v>

5899
02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:09.811
<v Speaker 4>infinitely,</v>

5900
02:23:09.811 --> 02:23:10.531
<v Speaker 4>precisely.</v>

5901
02:23:10.531 --> 02:23:14.820
<v Speaker 4>You throw it a dax exact same way and it lands in the exact same dirt with the</v>

5902
02:23:14.821 --> 02:23:16.080
<v Speaker 4>exact same resistance.</v>

5903
02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:17.153
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

5904
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:21.300
<v Speaker 4>I would assume it's infinitely precisely going to land the same spot if random.</v>

5905
02:23:21.301 --> 02:23:23.430
<v Speaker 4>This is a force at work in nature.</v>

5906
02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:28.260
<v Speaker 4>Why did [inaudible] factor itself into our little experiment here?</v>

5907
02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Cause you little experiments.</v>

5908
02:23:29.221 --> 02:23:30.054
<v Speaker 4>Impossible.</v>

5909
02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:30.900
<v Speaker 4>But that's irrelevance.</v>

5910
02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:31.733
<v Speaker 4>A thought experiment.</v>

5911
02:23:31.890 --> 02:23:32.470
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

5912
02:23:32.470 --> 02:23:35.520
<v Speaker 4>it's not creating a logical universe.</v>

5913
02:23:35.610 --> 02:23:35.761
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

5914
02:23:35.761 --> 02:23:36.990
<v Speaker 4>but it's not logically impossible.</v>

5915
02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5916
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:37.351
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5917
02:23:37.351 --> 02:23:38.520
<v Speaker 4>in that case though,</v>

5918
02:23:38.521 --> 02:23:40.410
<v Speaker 4>with the variables that you presented.</v>

5919
02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5920
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

5921
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:42.710
<v Speaker 4>well where's randomness?</v>

5922
02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:43.081
<v Speaker 4>Where's this?</v>

5923
02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Four is no randomness.</v>

5924
02:23:44.401 --> 02:23:48.780
<v Speaker 4>If you're recreating the entire earth in a in a very duplicatable way,</v>

5925
02:23:48.781 --> 02:23:50.160
<v Speaker 4>that's not randomness at all.</v>

5926
02:23:50.161 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 4>It is random.</v>

5927
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:51.150
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing.</v>

5928
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:52.140
<v Speaker 4>There is no randomness,</v>

5929
02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:52.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5930
02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:52.981
<v Speaker 4>Random.</v>

5931
02:23:52.981 --> 02:23:56.830
<v Speaker 4>This is when a human being can no longer compute all the factors and he,</v>

5932
02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.500
<v Speaker 4>we use an expression called randomness,</v>

5933
02:23:58.501 --> 02:23:59.130
<v Speaker 4>meaning,</v>

5934
02:23:59.130 --> 02:23:59.371
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

5935
02:23:59.371 --> 02:24:01.770
<v Speaker 4>I rolled the dice had landed on on seven randomly.</v>

5936
02:24:02.130 --> 02:24:02.401
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

5937
02:24:02.401 --> 02:24:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Because I couldn't compute all the variables.</v>

5938
02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5939
02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Series.</v>

5940
02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:06.581
<v Speaker 4>So the random,</v>

5941
02:24:06.581 --> 02:24:07.530
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of a,</v>

5942
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:08.221
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

5943
02:24:08.221 --> 02:24:10.560
<v Speaker 4>it's an illusion that we project onto the world.</v>

5944
02:24:10.770 --> 02:24:11.431
<v Speaker 4>So La Plas,</v>

5945
02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:13.350
<v Speaker 4>one of the greatest physicists in history,</v>

5946
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:14.030
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

5947
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.910
<v Speaker 4>A similar place.</v>

5948
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:15.181
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

5949
02:24:15.181 --> 02:24:15.870
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

5950
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:17.100
<v Speaker 4>look at a billiard ball table.</v>

5951
02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:17.941
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

5952
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:20.310
<v Speaker 4>If you tell me which way you're going to break the billiard balls,</v>

5953
02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.030
<v Speaker 4>if you tell me what philocity and what angle you're gonna hit the cue ball,</v>

5954
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I could tell you where every single ball is going to be on the pool table.</v>

5955
02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what laplace says.</v>

5956
02:24:30.001 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

5957
02:24:30.270 --> 02:24:31.590
<v Speaker 4>He's a phenomenal thinker.</v>

5958
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.941
<v Speaker 4>And he says,</v>

5959
02:24:32.941 --> 02:24:33.151
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

5960
02:24:33.151 --> 02:24:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm going to take that table.</v>

5961
02:24:34.321 --> 02:24:35.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to turn it to a math.</v>

5962
02:24:35.430 --> 02:24:36.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take the weight of the ball.</v>

5963
02:24:36.481 --> 02:24:37.380
<v Speaker 4>The friction of the table,</v>

5964
02:24:37.381 --> 02:24:37.541
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5965
02:24:37.541 --> 02:24:38.730
<v Speaker 4>the density of the bands,</v>

5966
02:24:38.731 --> 02:24:38.941
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5967
02:24:38.941 --> 02:24:39.111
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5968
02:24:39.111 --> 02:24:39.411
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5969
02:24:39.411 --> 02:24:40.860
<v Speaker 4>the gravity of the earth.</v>

5970
02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:41.753
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

5971
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to take all those variables.</v>

5972
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to put them up on this board here.</v>

5973
02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:48.720
<v Speaker 4>All they need to know is how hard you can hit the ball and I'll tell you</v>

5974
02:24:48.721 --> 02:24:50.350
<v Speaker 4>precisely where every ball is going to lend.</v>

5975
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.151
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

5976
02:24:51.151 --> 02:24:54.840
<v Speaker 4>somebody who doesn't know mathematics or geometry is going to look at that table</v>

5977
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:56.400
<v Speaker 4>when he sees the break to him.</v>

5978
02:24:56.401 --> 02:24:58.590
<v Speaker 4>It's going to seem random but random.</v>

5979
02:24:58.591 --> 02:25:00.120
<v Speaker 4>This is really a reflection of his ignorance.</v>

5980
02:25:00.121 --> 02:25:02.010
<v Speaker 4>He's not able to compute all this information.</v>

5981
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:06.870
<v Speaker 4>That's why the plas says to God the world is not random to somebody who has</v>

5982
02:25:06.871 --> 02:25:07.704
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

5983
02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:08.910
<v Speaker 4>The world is not random.</v>

5984
02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:11.250
<v Speaker 4>That's why he says it was very important.</v>

5985
02:25:11.251 --> 02:25:11.520
<v Speaker 4>That's weight.</v>

5986
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:14.520
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're sold deterministic because we believe that what's happening</v>

5987
02:25:14.521 --> 02:25:16.710
<v Speaker 4>right now is a byproduct of the past.</v>

5988
02:25:17.850 --> 02:25:19.530
<v Speaker 4>The past caused this happening right now.</v>

5989
02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:22.260
<v Speaker 4>The past was out of your control.</v>

5990
02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:23.920
<v Speaker 4>If I the universe</v>

5991
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 5>and let it play all over again,</v>

5992
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:26.980
<v Speaker 5>I identical circumstances,</v>

5993
02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.650
<v Speaker 5>you would drink that exact same amount of coffee you had today.</v>

5994
02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:30.780
<v Speaker 5>You would have made the same,</v>

5995
02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 5>have married the same woman,</v>

5996
02:25:31.991 --> 02:25:32.801
<v Speaker 5>you would have had the same kids.</v>

5997
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:34.330
<v Speaker 5>You would have had the same t shirt on.</v>

5998
02:25:34.331 --> 02:25:35.980
<v Speaker 5>Right now you would have the Mike at the same.</v>

5999
02:25:35.981 --> 02:25:37.720
<v Speaker 5>This everything would be reset.</v>

6000
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 5>So when we look at the world through the eyes of physics,</v>

6001
02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:45.130
<v Speaker 5>they say the cause of Linus complete the cause of Linus.</v>

6002
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Complete meaning where is this space for randomness or freewill?</v>

6003
02:25:49.970 --> 02:25:51.730
<v Speaker 5>It w we don't factor it in.</v>

6004
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:55.900
<v Speaker 5>The only time we do factor it in is when we look at ourselves inwardly.</v>

6005
02:25:56.290 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 5>But when we look at the world objectively as a third person,</v>

6006
02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:01.000
<v Speaker 5>so there's two views.</v>

6007
02:26:01.001 --> 02:26:02.860
<v Speaker 5>There's an internal view of first person experience.</v>

6008
02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:04.083
<v Speaker 5>We don't believe,</v>

6009
02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 5>we don't believe in determinism.</v>

6010
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.880
<v Speaker 5>We were,</v>

6011
02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:07.713
<v Speaker 5>we have free will.</v>

6012
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:09.280
<v Speaker 5>That's first person experience.</v>

6013
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Third Person Experience.</v>

6014
02:26:11.111 --> 02:26:12.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm studying Joe.</v>

6015
02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 5>All I see in Joe is billiard balls.</v>

6016
02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:15.281
<v Speaker 5>So when you have a thought,</v>

6017
02:26:15.281 --> 02:26:16.810
<v Speaker 5>it's all billiard balls hitting one another.</v>

6018
02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:20.080
<v Speaker 5>And if I had an infinitely precise calculator,</v>

6019
02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:21.580
<v Speaker 5>it according to the a plus,</v>

6020
02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I could tell you where you're going to be five years from now,</v>

6021
02:26:24.371 --> 02:26:25.204
<v Speaker 5>what you're going to be doing.</v>

6022
02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:25.751
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

6023
02:26:25.751 --> 02:26:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm seeing one billiard ball hit another.</v>

6024
02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:29.260
<v Speaker 5>It's just take that pool table,</v>

6025
02:26:29.261 --> 02:26:33.100
<v Speaker 5>experiment and make it the greatest pool game in history.</v>

6026
02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:35.320
<v Speaker 5>There are countless atoms.</v>

6027
02:26:35.321 --> 02:26:37.570
<v Speaker 5>There are countless billiard balls striking into one another.</v>

6028
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:41.990
<v Speaker 5>Somebody can calculate the world of physics and tell you where your hand's going</v>

6029
02:26:41.991 --> 02:26:42.161
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>

6030
02:26:42.161 --> 02:26:42.641
<v Speaker 5>Laplas says,</v>

6031
02:26:42.641 --> 02:26:44.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tell you where your hand's going to be in five years from now,</v>

6032
02:26:45.250 --> 02:26:46.570
<v Speaker 5>but you don't know my personal choices.</v>

6033
02:26:46.571 --> 02:26:47.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to make it.</v>

6034
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:47.853
<v Speaker 5>That's irrelevant.</v>

6035
02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:49.391
<v Speaker 5>That's a way he'll tell you.</v>

6036
02:26:49.391 --> 02:26:49.901
<v Speaker 5>That's irrelevant.</v>

6037
02:26:49.901 --> 02:26:50.350
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

6038
02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:52.480
<v Speaker 5>Because he sees the billiard balls moving inside your mind,</v>

6039
02:26:52.481 --> 02:26:53.314
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

6040
02:26:54.490 --> 02:26:57.130
<v Speaker 5>Now Leipnetz reconcile the two because see,</v>

6041
02:26:57.131 --> 02:26:57.964
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

6042
02:26:58.180 --> 02:26:58.600
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>

6043
02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:00.370
<v Speaker 5>when I living in the first person,</v>

6044
02:27:00.371 --> 02:27:01.300
<v Speaker 5>this is my intuition,</v>

6045
02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.231
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

6046
02:27:02.231 --> 02:27:02.381
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

6047
02:27:02.381 --> 02:27:03.850
<v Speaker 5>I grabbed that Coffee Cup of coffee.</v>

6048
02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:05.650
<v Speaker 5>I had this internal experience.</v>

6049
02:27:05.651 --> 02:27:06.850
<v Speaker 5>It's outside of physics.</v>

6050
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:09.760
<v Speaker 5>So Lyman has gives a great example.</v>

6051
02:27:09.761 --> 02:27:10.031
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

6052
02:27:10.031 --> 02:27:10.864
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6053
02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:12.191
<v Speaker 5>if I was really,</v>

6054
02:27:12.191 --> 02:27:13.810
<v Speaker 5>really tiny and I'd walk around in your mind,</v>

6055
02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:16.210
<v Speaker 5>I would see blood flow.</v>

6056
02:27:16.211 --> 02:27:17.620
<v Speaker 5>I would see neurons firing.</v>

6057
02:27:17.650 --> 02:27:21.460
<v Speaker 5>I would see all sorts of biological interactions,</v>

6058
02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:24.160
<v Speaker 5>but I wouldn't see anything of consciousness.</v>

6059
02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:25.690
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't see your thoughts.</v>

6060
02:27:25.691 --> 02:27:27.880
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't see you thinking about your wife,</v>

6061
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:28.331
<v Speaker 5>a hearing,</v>

6062
02:27:28.331 --> 02:27:29.320
<v Speaker 5>your child's voice,</v>

6063
02:27:29.650 --> 02:27:30.910
<v Speaker 5>thinking about what you want to have for dinner.</v>

6064
02:27:30.911 --> 02:27:31.744
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't see any of that.</v>

6065
02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:34.450
<v Speaker 5>I would just see billiard balls hitting one another.</v>

6066
02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:36.273
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

6067
02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:39.430
<v Speaker 5>now that I'm having this first person experience,</v>

6068
02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:40.960
<v Speaker 5>there's something we call intuition.</v>

6069
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:42.550
<v Speaker 5>This first person experience itself,</v>

6070
02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.510
<v Speaker 5>you're having this spiritual type of transcendent experience.</v>

6071
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:48.760
<v Speaker 5>What it's like to have a thought,</v>

6072
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:49.810
<v Speaker 5>what it's like to be me.</v>

6073
02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:50.973
<v Speaker 5>So for instance,</v>

6074
02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:52.300
<v Speaker 5>I see the cup of coffee,</v>

6075
02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:55.720
<v Speaker 5>I desire the cup of coffee and I drink it.</v>

6076
02:27:56.170 --> 02:27:59.560
<v Speaker 5>Science has nothing that has no information about my conscious experience,</v>

6077
02:27:59.561 --> 02:28:00.830
<v Speaker 5>my intuitive experience it.</v>

6078
02:28:00.831 --> 02:28:02.940
<v Speaker 5>The science is not absolute.</v>

6079
02:28:02.941 --> 02:28:04.690
<v Speaker 5>It cannot tell me everything about the universe.</v>

6080
02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.730
<v Speaker 5>It could only tell me about the billiard balls.</v>

6081
02:28:06.731 --> 02:28:07.840
<v Speaker 5>It can only go so far.</v>

6082
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:08.951
<v Speaker 5>At that point,</v>

6083
02:28:08.951 --> 02:28:11.440
<v Speaker 5>it has to stop because it doesn't have,</v>

6084
02:28:11.441 --> 02:28:12.274
<v Speaker 5>we don't,</v>

6085
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.470
<v Speaker 5>our senses cannot sense.</v>

6086
02:28:14.471 --> 02:28:15.970
<v Speaker 5>The conscious experience that we're having.</v>

6087
02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:18.910
<v Speaker 5>The conscious experience is only known intuitively.</v>

6088
02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:20.680
<v Speaker 5>So first person experience,</v>

6089
02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:22.280
<v Speaker 5>so 11 it says this.</v>

6090
02:28:22.281 --> 02:28:22.491
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>

6091
02:28:22.491 --> 02:28:22.701
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6092
02:28:22.701 --> 02:28:24.260
<v Speaker 5>you look at the world when you study the world,</v>

6093
02:28:24.261 --> 02:28:26.030
<v Speaker 5>we're all seeing billiard balls hitting one another.</v>

6094
02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:27.260
<v Speaker 5>Nobody argues about that.</v>

6095
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:28.281
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

6096
02:28:28.281 --> 02:28:30.170
<v Speaker 5>our intuition is telling as that's all untrue.</v>

6097
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.550
<v Speaker 5>We have the chat.</v>

6098
02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:33.350
<v Speaker 5>We have the ability to move our own hand,</v>

6099
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:34.550
<v Speaker 5>desire something,</v>

6100
02:28:34.551 --> 02:28:35.270
<v Speaker 5>grab something,</v>

6101
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.781
<v Speaker 5>eat something,</v>

6102
02:28:35.781 --> 02:28:36.501
<v Speaker 5>consumed something,</v>

6103
02:28:36.501 --> 02:28:37.334
<v Speaker 5>make a choice.</v>

6104
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:38.421
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

6105
02:28:38.421 --> 02:28:39.260
<v Speaker 5>how are the two,</v>

6106
02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 5>how can they coexist?</v>

6107
02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Because remember in reason for me to accept something as logically true after</v>

6108
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:47.210
<v Speaker 5>eliminate every other possibility.</v>

6109
02:28:47.810 --> 02:28:49.310
<v Speaker 5>So he found the one possibility,</v>

6110
02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.090
<v Speaker 5>one possibility that till today it's never been refuted.</v>

6111
02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:55.970
<v Speaker 5>He says that he calls it the the twin trains.</v>

6112
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:57.650
<v Speaker 5>So picture two trains.</v>

6113
02:28:57.651 --> 02:28:58.484
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

6114
02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:00.260
<v Speaker 5>They're going up and down,</v>

6115
02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:01.310
<v Speaker 5>side by side,</v>

6116
02:29:01.311 --> 02:29:02.360
<v Speaker 5>traveling at the same speed.</v>

6117
02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:05.360
<v Speaker 5>They look like they're connected to one another,</v>

6118
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:06.403
<v Speaker 5>but they're not.</v>

6119
02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:07.370
<v Speaker 5>They're just synchronized.</v>

6120
02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:09.380
<v Speaker 5>Every time one goes left,</v>

6121
02:29:09.381 --> 02:29:10.011
<v Speaker 5>the other one goes left,</v>

6122
02:29:10.011 --> 02:29:10.431
<v Speaker 5>one goes up,</v>

6123
02:29:10.431 --> 02:29:11.264
<v Speaker 5>one goes down.</v>

6124
02:29:12.170 --> 02:29:14.570
<v Speaker 5>And so when I lighten this tells you,</v>

6125
02:29:14.571 --> 02:29:14.811
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>

6126
02:29:14.811 --> 02:29:14.961
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6127
02:29:14.961 --> 02:29:16.400
<v Speaker 5>when you reach for that cup of coffee,</v>

6128
02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:20.330
<v Speaker 5>the universe had already decided millions of billions of years ago that that was</v>

6129
02:29:20.331 --> 02:29:21.164
<v Speaker 5>going to happen.</v>

6130
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Your intuitive sense just coincides with it perfectly.</v>

6131
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:28.910
<v Speaker 5>And he said that's what he calls a twin trains theory.</v>

6132
02:29:28.911 --> 02:29:33.911
<v Speaker 5>That the correlation theory that your desire to grab that cup of coffee doesn't</v>

6133
02:29:34.731 --> 02:29:35.564
<v Speaker 5>affect your hand,</v>

6134
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:36.620
<v Speaker 5>does not move your hand.</v>

6135
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:37.281
<v Speaker 5>That'll be impossible.</v>

6136
02:29:37.281 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 5>There'll be something nonphysical moving,</v>

6137
02:29:38.751 --> 02:29:39.590
<v Speaker 5>something physical.</v>

6138
02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:42.320
<v Speaker 5>So he says that they're just correlated perfectly.</v>

6139
02:29:42.321 --> 02:29:44.840
<v Speaker 5>When you ask them how do they correlate so perfectly,</v>

6140
02:29:44.841 --> 02:29:45.081
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

6141
02:29:45.081 --> 02:29:45.500
<v Speaker 5>well God,</v>

6142
02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:48.140
<v Speaker 5>it's like God took the girls the greatest pool shot in history.</v>

6143
02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:51.640
<v Speaker 5>This is like nuts.</v>

6144
02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:52.061
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>

6145
02:29:52.061 --> 02:29:52.894
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>

6146
02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:54.910
<v Speaker 5>he's the guy who invented the calculus,</v>

6147
02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.320
<v Speaker 5>the binary code,</v>

6148
02:29:56.321 --> 02:29:56.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6149
02:29:56.441 --> 02:29:57.490
<v Speaker 5>like all our computers.</v>

6150
02:29:57.491 --> 02:29:59.170
<v Speaker 5>So they work cause of the cause of Lebanon's.</v>

6151
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:02.343
<v Speaker 5>That</v>

6152
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:04.160
<v Speaker 2>to me is a hard sell.</v>

6153
02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6154
02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.200
<v Speaker 2>So most people can't wrap their mind around it.</v>

6155
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6156
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:07.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard sell.</v>

6157
02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:08.811
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

6158
02:30:08.811 --> 02:30:10.380
<v Speaker 2>he can see a woman come,</v>

6159
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:12.320
<v Speaker 2>created the first computer code.</v>

6160
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.461
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6161
02:30:13.461 --> 02:30:13.730
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

6162
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:16.660
<v Speaker 2>he invented the binary code binary combine they Rico,</v>

6163
02:30:16.661 --> 02:30:17.321
<v Speaker 2>not computer code,</v>

6164
02:30:17.321 --> 02:30:18.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's based on binary.</v>

6165
02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Now when he sang,</v>

6166
02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:21.260
<v Speaker 2>he sang this,</v>

6167
02:30:21.261 --> 02:30:25.550
<v Speaker 2>that your desire coincides with the universe having this.</v>

6168
02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:27.590
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a lot of woo.</v>

6169
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:29.330
<v Speaker 2>That seems like why a bit of a stretch.</v>

6170
02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:30.190
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting point.</v>

6171
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Tell me why.</v>

6172
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.921
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6173
02:30:30.921 --> 02:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>why would the universe have a plan for you and your mother?</v>

6174
02:30:35.051 --> 02:30:35.421
<v Speaker 2>He's saying,</v>

6175
02:30:35.421 --> 02:30:35.631
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6176
02:30:35.631 --> 02:30:36.770
<v Speaker 2>he's saying God directly.</v>

6177
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:37.633
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6178
02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:39.373
<v Speaker 2>prove that.</v>

6179
02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:39.771
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6180
02:30:39.771 --> 02:30:40.280
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>

6181
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:41.113
<v Speaker 2>that's a great,</v>

6182
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:42.103
<v Speaker 2>that's a great objection.</v>

6183
02:30:42.470 --> 02:30:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say that it would be gone?</v>

6184
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Argument wasn't to prove God.</v>

6185
02:30:45.951 --> 02:30:46.650
<v Speaker 2>This argument</v>

6186
02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:49.070
<v Speaker 5>was to tell you that</v>

6187
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:50.780
<v Speaker 2>this is a possibility.</v>

6188
02:30:50.930 --> 02:30:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Why you have freewill is true and so is determinism.</v>

6189
02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6190
02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Because can you deny freewill aren't you're having a direct experience of</v>

6191
02:30:57.610 --> 02:30:58.443
<v Speaker 2>freewill?</v>

6192
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6193
02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:02.150
<v Speaker 2>the only denial of freewill would be determinism.</v>

6194
02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:05.810
<v Speaker 2>The only denial would be that your idea of freewill is an illusion.</v>

6195
02:31:05.811 --> 02:31:08.750
<v Speaker 2>It's you are really shaped by the momentum of your past,</v>

6196
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:10.040
<v Speaker 2>your genetics,</v>

6197
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:11.840
<v Speaker 2>live experiences,</v>

6198
02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:16.460
<v Speaker 2>all the variables and the way you've absorbed emotions and interactions with</v>

6199
02:31:16.461 --> 02:31:18.170
<v Speaker 2>people and that these are flavored.</v>

6200
02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Your very being to the point when when presented with an obstacle or an</v>

6201
02:31:21.811 --> 02:31:23.070
<v Speaker 2>opportunity or a thing,</v>

6202
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:27.300
<v Speaker 2>there is a predetermined solution in your mind for whatever the situation is.</v>

6203
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:28.620
<v Speaker 2>That's determinism.</v>

6204
02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:29.071
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6205
02:31:29.071 --> 02:31:29.480
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

6206
02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:29.710
<v Speaker 5>let,</v>

6207
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:30.031
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

6208
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:30.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6209
02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:30.570
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

6210
02:31:30.570 --> 02:31:32.490
<v Speaker 5>let's say action rather than solution.</v>

6211
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:35.400
<v Speaker 5>Let's take a step back and look at what five minutes is trying to say.</v>

6212
02:31:35.430 --> 02:31:36.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6213
02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:36.811
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to say,</v>

6214
02:31:36.811 --> 02:31:37.051
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6215
02:31:37.051 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 5>there's three ways of knowing something and yeah.</v>

6216
02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:40.080
<v Speaker 5>Evidence that this is a brilliant human being.</v>

6217
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

6218
02:31:40.770 --> 02:31:41.431
<v Speaker 5>Not many,</v>

6219
02:31:41.431 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

6220
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:43.980
<v Speaker 5>many men have said the same thing throughout history.</v>

6221
02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:45.193
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

6222
02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:47.240
<v Speaker 5>let's just at least entertain it.</v>

6223
02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:48.091
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

6224
02:31:48.091 --> 02:31:48.241
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6225
02:31:48.241 --> 02:31:51.600
<v Speaker 5>you know something empirically through your senses.</v>

6226
02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:53.083
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6227
02:31:53.130 --> 02:31:53.761
<v Speaker 5>you touch fire,</v>

6228
02:31:53.761 --> 02:31:54.594
<v Speaker 5>it's hot.</v>

6229
02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:55.770
<v Speaker 5>Then you can know something.</v>

6230
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:59.220
<v Speaker 5>Deductively one plus one equals two via logic.</v>

6231
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.230
<v Speaker 5>Then you could know something intuitively meaning direct first experience.</v>

6232
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:05.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6233
02:32:05.530 --> 02:32:06.330
<v Speaker 5>so let's,</v>

6234
02:32:06.330 --> 02:32:07.163
<v Speaker 5>so let's say,</v>

6235
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:09.510
<v Speaker 5>let's say you tell me,</v>

6236
02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:10.380
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

6237
02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:11.213
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6238
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:14.310
<v Speaker 5>I've had the coffee tastes great.</v>

6239
02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:18.750
<v Speaker 5>You don't know that deductively or empirically the sensation of coffee tasting</v>

6240
02:32:18.751 --> 02:32:20.220
<v Speaker 5>great is known intuitively.</v>

6241
02:32:20.221 --> 02:32:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Direct meaning there is no,</v>

6242
02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:23.580
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6243
02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 5>there is no interpreter and philosophy.</v>

6244
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:29.270
<v Speaker 5>We something called the egocentric predicament.</v>

6245
02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:35.030
<v Speaker 5>So right now you're experiencing this entire room within your consciousness,</v>

6246
02:32:35.390 --> 02:32:35.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6247
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:38.750
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] I might be outside of Your Eagle,</v>

6248
02:32:38.751 --> 02:32:39.260
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>

6249
02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:41.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm occurring right now in your consciousness.</v>

6250
02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the difference perceiving you saw in my consciousness or with my</v>

6251
02:32:48.551 --> 02:32:49.384
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

6252
02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:51.880
<v Speaker 2>which is connected to my senses?</v>

6253
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything you can perceive outside of your consciousness?</v>

6254
02:32:58.290 --> 02:33:00.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird say way of saying something that's impossible,</v>

6255
02:33:01.090 --> 02:33:03.850
<v Speaker 2>but perceiving outside of my consciousness,</v>

6256
02:33:03.851 --> 02:33:05.440
<v Speaker 2>meaning not being,</v>

6257
02:33:05.890 --> 02:33:06.940
<v Speaker 2>not conscious,</v>

6258
02:33:06.941 --> 02:33:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but yet still perceiving.</v>

6259
02:33:08.650 --> 02:33:08.981
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6260
02:33:08.981 --> 02:33:10.210
<v Speaker 2>When you perceive something,</v>

6261
02:33:10.211 --> 02:33:12.490
<v Speaker 2>it has to be within your consciousness,</v>

6262
02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:12.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6263
02:33:12.731 --> 02:33:14.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to or with your consciousness,</v>

6264
02:33:15.250 --> 02:33:15.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6265
02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It cannot be outside of your branch.</v>

6266
02:33:16.991 --> 02:33:19.090
<v Speaker 2>So even if something touches your skin,</v>

6267
02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you're consciously recognizing that it touches your skin.</v>

6268
02:33:23.450 --> 02:33:24.283
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6269
02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:25.240
<v Speaker 5>the egocentric,</v>

6270
02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:28.570
<v Speaker 5>but they come in is more about your whole universe is made up of your</v>

6271
02:33:28.571 --> 02:33:29.200
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>

6272
02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:33.280
<v Speaker 5>You cannot sense anything or experience anything or get any information outside</v>

6273
02:33:33.281 --> 02:33:33.791
<v Speaker 5>of your conscious.</v>

6274
02:33:33.791 --> 02:33:34.900
<v Speaker 5>Like cotton was very big on this.</v>

6275
02:33:34.901 --> 02:33:35.141
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

6276
02:33:35.141 --> 02:33:35.800
<v Speaker 5>look this,</v>

6277
02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:36.880
<v Speaker 5>this is called idealism.</v>

6278
02:33:37.730 --> 02:33:39.970
<v Speaker 5>The whole world is happening on inside your head,</v>

6279
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:40.211
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6280
02:33:40.211 --> 02:33:40.901
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly likes,</v>

6281
02:33:40.901 --> 02:33:41.261
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

6282
02:33:41.261 --> 02:33:42.250
<v Speaker 5>you see this cup of coffee,</v>

6283
02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:45.460
<v Speaker 5>they're going to say like clusters hit the cup of coffee.</v>

6284
02:33:45.490 --> 02:33:46.241
<v Speaker 5>It goes into your eye,</v>

6285
02:33:46.241 --> 02:33:46.960
<v Speaker 5>your eye,</v>

6286
02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:47.411
<v Speaker 5>your eye.</v>

6287
02:33:47.411 --> 02:33:48.430
<v Speaker 5>It gives your brain a signal.</v>

6288
02:33:48.431 --> 02:33:48.790
<v Speaker 5>You're sick.</v>

6289
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:51.370
<v Speaker 5>Your brain interprets the signal and creates this universe around you.</v>

6290
02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:52.493
<v Speaker 5>Creates this image,</v>

6291
02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:53.770
<v Speaker 5>the theater of your mind.</v>

6292
02:33:53.771 --> 02:33:54.604
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6293
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:57.370
<v Speaker 5>Can you experience anything outside the theater of your mind?</v>

6294
02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult to argue that you could.</v>

6295
02:34:03.950 --> 02:34:04.640
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

6296
02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6297
02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:07.100
<v Speaker 2>According to all the philosophers in history,</v>

6298
02:34:07.101 --> 02:34:07.331
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

6299
02:34:07.331 --> 02:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>

6300
02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:08.533
<v Speaker 2>we cannot.</v>

6301
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:10.400
<v Speaker 2>This is called the ego centric particular.</v>

6302
02:34:10.401 --> 02:34:13.750
<v Speaker 2>What about subconscious that be still happening inside your,</v>

6303
02:34:13.751 --> 02:34:14.600
<v Speaker 2>your conscious mind.</v>

6304
02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:19.690
<v Speaker 2>So subconscious is still somewhat conscious in some way.</v>

6305
02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:21.071
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6306
02:34:21.071 --> 02:34:21.610
<v Speaker 2>it would be happy.</v>

6307
02:34:21.610 --> 02:34:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

6308
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:26.170
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you would perceive would be happening in your conscious mind would just</v>

6309
02:34:26.171 --> 02:34:28.120
<v Speaker 2>be outside of your standard awareness.</v>

6310
02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Now the scary thing is is that we have,</v>

6311
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:33.190
<v Speaker 2>we make a lot of inferences and that's where the wool comes in.</v>

6312
02:34:33.191 --> 02:34:33.881
<v Speaker 2>Everything is will,</v>

6313
02:34:33.881 --> 02:34:37.450
<v Speaker 2>will you think he thinks just everything outside of sizes.</v>

6314
02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:39.810
<v Speaker 2>What woo sciences just as Wu was everyone else's.</v>

6315
02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:40.810
<v Speaker 2>You keep saying that,</v>

6316
02:34:40.811 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 2>but I don't understand why you're saying that because you haven't made a good</v>

6317
02:34:43.421 --> 02:34:43.871
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

6318
02:34:43.871 --> 02:34:44.081
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6319
02:34:44.081 --> 02:34:47.200
<v Speaker 2>We'll only example that you said was that they changed the way they look at</v>

6320
02:34:47.201 --> 02:34:49.130
<v Speaker 2>gravity when new information was presented,</v>

6321
02:34:49.131 --> 02:34:49.360
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6322
02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:50.141
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't equal.</v>

6323
02:34:50.141 --> 02:34:50.261
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>

6324
02:34:50.261 --> 02:34:51.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll gravity was will.</v>

6325
02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:53.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a magical force.</v>

6326
02:34:53.770 --> 02:34:54.220
<v Speaker 2>My grandma,</v>

6327
02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:54.710
<v Speaker 2>my grandma,</v>

6328
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:57.690
<v Speaker 2>think about gravity in terms of people that didn't even,</v>

6329
02:34:57.760 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't have phones,</v>

6330
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:01.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have cars,</v>

6331
02:35:01.361 --> 02:35:03.100
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have paved roads.</v>

6332
02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6333
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:07.180
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a very primitive notion of what gravity was.</v>

6334
02:35:07.181 --> 02:35:11.410
<v Speaker 2>It was a very interesting idea that has since been proven to be true.</v>

6335
02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:13.360
<v Speaker 2>False gravity,</v>

6336
02:35:13.930 --> 02:35:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Newtonian gravity.</v>

6337
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6338
02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Has been proven to be false,</v>

6339
02:35:16.631 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 2>but gravity is still real,</v>

6340
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6341
02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Not we're using the same word for a completely different idea,</v>

6342
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:23.463
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6343
02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:26.290
<v Speaker 2>so Newton's gravity was magical.</v>

6344
02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.340
<v Speaker 2>It was an appeal to magic.</v>

6345
02:35:27.730 --> 02:35:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6346
02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:28.931
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

6347
02:35:28.931 --> 02:35:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Here is gravity is different than Einstein's gravity that Einstein's gravity is</v>

6348
02:35:33.581 --> 02:35:34.570
<v Speaker 2>what's been proven,</v>

6349
02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:35.261
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6350
02:35:35.261 --> 02:35:38.440
<v Speaker 2>We know now that light does bend around the mass of the sun,</v>

6351
02:35:38.441 --> 02:35:41.830
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why we have a hard time seeing asteroids that are</v>

6352
02:35:41.831 --> 02:35:46.660
<v Speaker 2>coming from behind the sun because the mass of the sun actually Ben Space Time</v>

6353
02:35:46.661 --> 02:35:48.760
<v Speaker 2>around it to the point where it distorts our view.</v>

6354
02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:50.290
<v Speaker 2>It's our new narrative.</v>

6355
02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:51.153
<v Speaker 2>It's not proven.</v>

6356
02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:55.270
<v Speaker 2>You can never prove a scientific fact past the level of hypothesis.</v>

6357
02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:57.151
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

6358
02:35:57.151 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds strange,</v>

6359
02:35:58.001 --> 02:36:00.160
<v Speaker 2>but what do you mean pass the level of hypothesis?</v>

6360
02:36:00.161 --> 02:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>If you can prove it in studies and tests and shit,</v>

6361
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:05.530
<v Speaker 2>you still don't buy it.</v>

6362
02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:07.690
<v Speaker 2>You have not eliminated every other possibility.</v>

6363
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6364
02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:09.730
<v Speaker 2>so it's not the same as a logical flow.</v>

6365
02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:10.301
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>

6366
02:36:10.301 --> 02:36:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

6367
02:36:10.930 --> 02:36:11.260
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

6368
02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:12.150
<v Speaker 2>this is understood in,</v>

6369
02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:12.391
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

6370
02:36:12.391 --> 02:36:15.820
<v Speaker 2>in like in the philosophy of science.</v>

6371
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:16.390
<v Speaker 2>It's quick,</v>

6372
02:36:16.390 --> 02:36:16.811
<v Speaker 2>it's comfortable.</v>

6373
02:36:16.811 --> 02:36:17.501
<v Speaker 2>He accepted.</v>

6374
02:36:17.501 --> 02:36:18.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not anti science.</v>

6375
02:36:18.341 --> 02:36:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not trying to say anything.</v>

6376
02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:19.481
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6377
02:36:19.481 --> 02:36:20.314
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not.</v>

6378
02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:24.430
<v Speaker 2>You were saying that science has so much woo and I'm not seeing the woo.</v>

6379
02:36:24.431 --> 02:36:29.431
<v Speaker 2>Part of what I'm seeing is the necessary testing and the idea of incorporating</v>

6380
02:36:31.721 --> 02:36:35.200
<v Speaker 2>new data or heritage changing beliefs and ideas.</v>

6381
02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

6382
02:36:35.460 --> 02:36:35.730
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

6383
02:36:35.730 --> 02:36:36.800
<v Speaker 2>this is quite a,</v>

6384
02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>that's a bit of a difficult thing to wrap your mind off it in one day,</v>

6385
02:36:39.041 --> 02:36:41.840
<v Speaker 2>but you have to think about it and throughout time [inaudible] it comes to</v>

6386
02:36:41.841 --> 02:36:42.674
<v Speaker 2>clearer and clearer.</v>

6387
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:44.380
<v Speaker 2>When we observe the universe,</v>

6388
02:36:44.410 --> 02:36:46.690
<v Speaker 2>all we see is patterns and regularities found in nature.</v>

6389
02:36:46.691 --> 02:36:47.524
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

6390
02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:49.630
<v Speaker 2>We don't see actual physical laws.</v>

6391
02:36:50.290 --> 02:36:52.540
<v Speaker 2>The physical laws are bookmarks inside our mind.</v>

6392
02:36:52.930 --> 02:36:54.820
<v Speaker 2>We see the same pattern over and over again,</v>

6393
02:36:55.210 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 2>and then we attribute a physical law,</v>

6394
02:36:58.090 --> 02:36:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but that physical art doesn't exist out there.</v>

6395
02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:01.720
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

6396
02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:02.560
<v Speaker 2>here's a great example,</v>

6397
02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:03.100
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

6398
02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:03.311
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6399
02:37:03.311 --> 02:37:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you a great example.</v>

6400
02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:05.501
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6401
02:37:05.501 --> 02:37:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I'm about to flip a coin.</v>

6402
02:37:07.090 --> 02:37:07.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

6403
02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going to tell me it's probably going to land on heads or tails.</v>

6404
02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:12.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6405
02:37:13.450 --> 02:37:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that logically or is it based on your history with coins?</v>

6406
02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I know it logically and based on my history of corns.</v>

6407
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

6408
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:22.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm arguing.</v>

6409
02:37:22.821 --> 02:37:23.720
<v Speaker 2>You don't know it logically.</v>

6410
02:37:24.350 --> 02:37:25.760
<v Speaker 2>You only note on your past history.</v>

6411
02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:26.481
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

6412
02:37:26.481 --> 02:37:28.200
<v Speaker 2>So pay attention to this.</v>

6413
02:37:28.201 --> 02:37:28.510
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

6414
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:29.360
<v Speaker 2>this is a little bit weird.</v>

6415
02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:29.910
<v Speaker 2>This is what we got to.</v>

6416
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:31.340
<v Speaker 2>We had to go slow because it's been very weird,</v>

6417
02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:31.790
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

6418
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:32.241
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

6419
02:37:32.241 --> 02:37:32.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6420
02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it goes against our instincts.</v>

6421
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

6422
02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Erase all your history with coins.</v>

6423
02:37:35.961 --> 02:37:37.040
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen a coin before.</v>

6424
02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:37.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

6425
02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:39.230
<v Speaker 2>And I flip it right?</v>

6426
02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>And now it turns into a butterfly.</v>

6427
02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:42.350
<v Speaker 2>You never seen a coin before.</v>

6428
02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:43.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't surprise you.</v>

6429
02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:43.881
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

6430
02:37:43.881 --> 02:37:44.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6431
02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:48.560
<v Speaker 2>turn into a butterfly and I flip a coin a hundred times in front of you a</v>

6432
02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:49.610
<v Speaker 2>hundred times it turns into a butterfly.</v>

6433
02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to flip the coin a hundred,</v>

6434
02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:52.610
<v Speaker 2>the hundred and one time.</v>

6435
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:53.960
<v Speaker 2>You can be like,</v>

6436
02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I bet you it turns to a butterfly.</v>

6437
02:37:56.090 --> 02:37:57.950
<v Speaker 2>That's how we express science.</v>

6438
02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:00.590
<v Speaker 2>We see the patterns and regularities.</v>

6439
02:38:00.890 --> 02:38:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Then we achieve.</v>

6440
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:03.620
<v Speaker 2>We predict them science.</v>

6441
02:38:03.930 --> 02:38:04.240
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

6442
02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:05.073
<v Speaker 2>this is a little bit,</v>

6443
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:05.960
<v Speaker 2>this is a good way to put it.</v>

6444
02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Science is the faith.</v>

6445
02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's faith that the future will behave like the past.</v>

6446
02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Science is faith that the future will behave like the past.</v>

6447
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 2>So now you've developed a faith that this coin will flip into a butterfly</v>

6448
02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:25.700
<v Speaker 2>and now you can predict it.</v>

6449
02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you say that science is the use of measurement to understand matter and</v>

6450
02:38:34.191 --> 02:38:35.360
<v Speaker 2>things around us?</v>

6451
02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that it's using the past to predict the future.</v>

6452
02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I would say that if you know that fire melts led at a certain temperature and</v>

6453
02:38:46.761 --> 02:38:51.530
<v Speaker 2>this is provable and then you can show this over and over again.</v>

6454
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Here's what we know about fire and reaches a certain temperature.</v>

6455
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:57.830
<v Speaker 2>When led reaches a certain temperature,</v>

6456
02:38:57.860 --> 02:38:58.671
<v Speaker 2>it melts.</v>

6457
02:38:58.671 --> 02:38:59.810
<v Speaker 2>It changes its form.</v>

6458
02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you want to do that same task to carbon based steel,</v>

6459
02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:09.710
<v Speaker 2>it requires far greater temperatures and then we know that there's variables in</v>

6460
02:39:09.711 --> 02:39:10.544
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

6461
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:11.241
<v Speaker 2>If this is,</v>

6462
02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:12.074
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>

6463
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:14.510
<v Speaker 2>this is something that you can prove and show.</v>

6464
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:15.830
<v Speaker 2>There's no woo to that.</v>

6465
02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6466
02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Water boils at how many degrees?</v>

6467
02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:21.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's two 50 in south and southeast.</v>

6468
02:39:21.610 --> 02:39:22.640
<v Speaker 2>A hundred degrees Celsius.</v>

6469
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what Fahrenheit.</v>

6470
02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:24.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6471
02:39:24.351 --> 02:39:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you Canadians with your wacky metric system.</v>

6472
02:39:28.370 --> 02:39:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Is that a side effect?</v>

6473
02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Is it a scientific fact that water boils at a certain temperature?</v>

6474
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6475
02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Actually no,</v>

6476
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:36.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

6477
02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:37.970
<v Speaker 2>They can boil water now they can.</v>

6478
02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Water can resist boiling up to 200 degrees Celsius.</v>

6479
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:43.450
<v Speaker 2>If you put in a certain atmosphere,</v>

6480
02:39:43.730 --> 02:39:47.150
<v Speaker 2>atmospheric pressure and suspended in a certain liquid.</v>

6481
02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:48.890
<v Speaker 2>If you change the circumstance,</v>

6482
02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.930
<v Speaker 2>suspend water in liquids,</v>

6483
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:52.520
<v Speaker 2>they suspended in a particular liquid.</v>

6484
02:39:52.521 --> 02:39:52.780
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6485
02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:54.440
<v Speaker 2>that's not the heated or cooled,</v>

6486
02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:54.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6487
02:39:54.940 --> 02:39:55.251
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

6488
02:39:55.251 --> 02:39:56.031
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to.</v>

6489
02:39:56.031 --> 02:39:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't affect the temperature of the water itself.</v>

6490
02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.440
<v Speaker 2>And now water can boil at 200 degrees.</v>

6491
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:00.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6492
02:40:00.861 --> 02:40:02.900
<v Speaker 2>so you're doing something different to water.</v>

6493
02:40:02.930 --> 02:40:03.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

6494
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:06.080
<v Speaker 2>You're taking it outside of the normal earth environment.</v>

6495
02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:09.140
<v Speaker 2>So the variables also include Earth's environment.</v>

6496
02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:10.213
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

6497
02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 2>But water doesn't inherently boil at a hundred degrees.</v>

6498
02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:16.973
<v Speaker 5>It's not a fact.</v>

6499
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:18.420
<v Speaker 5>But we believe that to be a scientific,</v>

6500
02:40:18.490 --> 02:40:19.261
<v Speaker 5>we believe that water,</v>

6501
02:40:19.261 --> 02:40:20.071
<v Speaker 5>if it gets to a hundred degrees,</v>

6502
02:40:20.071 --> 02:40:20.521
<v Speaker 5>is boiling.</v>

6503
02:40:20.521 --> 02:40:21.360
<v Speaker 5>It's going to behave this way.</v>

6504
02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:22.171
<v Speaker 5>As a matter of fact.</v>

6505
02:40:22.171 --> 02:40:22.321
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

6506
02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:25.800
<v Speaker 5>There are many other things that that that fact has been debunked and there's</v>

6507
02:40:25.801 --> 02:40:27.390
<v Speaker 5>countless amount of facts like wait a minute,</v>

6508
02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:32.100
<v Speaker 5>is that the facts been debunked or is that when you add in sufficient external</v>

6509
02:40:32.101 --> 02:40:32.934
<v Speaker 5>variables,</v>

6510
02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:38.060
<v Speaker 5>then water takes longer to boil because of these variables playing into the</v>

6511
02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:41.130
<v Speaker 5>properties that we already observed with water.</v>

6512
02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:42.850
<v Speaker 5>That's why whenever we have a scientific factor,</v>

6513
02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:46.650
<v Speaker 5>might be new information coming to to change our view,</v>

6514
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:47.920
<v Speaker 5>change our view of this fact.</v>

6515
02:40:47.921 --> 02:40:48.180
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

6516
02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:52.380
<v Speaker 5>This is not necessarily new information with this is his new additional precise,</v>

6517
02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:53.280
<v Speaker 5>more precise information.</v>

6518
02:40:53.281 --> 02:40:54.840
<v Speaker 5>But what you're talking about with water,</v>

6519
02:40:54.841 --> 02:40:58.980
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about additional variables like that's just more science.</v>

6520
02:40:58.980 --> 02:40:59.940
<v Speaker 5>That's not woo.</v>

6521
02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:00.331
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6522
02:41:00.331 --> 02:41:01.164
<v Speaker 5>well here's some will.</v>

6523
02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:01.561
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6524
02:41:01.561 --> 02:41:03.710
<v Speaker 5>This is cause we talk about gravity was whew,</v>

6525
02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:04.651
<v Speaker 5>okay random.</v>

6526
02:41:04.651 --> 02:41:05.484
<v Speaker 5>This was whew.</v>

6527
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:06.031
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6528
02:41:06.031 --> 02:41:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Cause we,</v>

6529
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:08.520
<v Speaker 5>we cannot find one instance of actual randomness.</v>

6530
02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:11.070
<v Speaker 5>The causal lightness complete us.</v>

6531
02:41:11.071 --> 02:41:13.140
<v Speaker 5>Laplas would say there's no randomness in the world.</v>

6532
02:41:13.170 --> 02:41:14.070
<v Speaker 5>So the randomness,</v>

6533
02:41:14.071 --> 02:41:14.430
<v Speaker 5>ideas,</v>

6534
02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:16.460
<v Speaker 5>just our inability to calculate exactly.</v>

6535
02:41:16.461 --> 02:41:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Believably difficult variables.</v>

6536
02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:19.133
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

6537
02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:20.100
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

6538
02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:21.030
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

6539
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:22.530
<v Speaker 5>it's a projection of your ignorance.</v>

6540
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:24.480
<v Speaker 5>If you knew it wouldn't be random.</v>

6541
02:41:24.481 --> 02:41:25.314
<v Speaker 5>So for instance,</v>

6542
02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.860
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6543
02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:26.940
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember who coined the term,</v>

6544
02:41:26.941 --> 02:41:30.810
<v Speaker 5>but they say the man who says the tallest mountain I've ever seen is the tallest</v>

6545
02:41:30.811 --> 02:41:33.150
<v Speaker 5>mountain he's making himself.</v>

6546
02:41:33.151 --> 02:41:33.984
<v Speaker 5>The measure of truth.</v>

6547
02:41:34.020 --> 02:41:34.920
<v Speaker 5>I measure truth.</v>

6548
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:37.170
<v Speaker 5>If you take that perspective,</v>

6549
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:38.230
<v Speaker 5>you're the center of truth.</v>

6550
02:41:38.231 --> 02:41:39.064
<v Speaker 5>I am truth.</v>

6551
02:41:39.090 --> 02:41:40.590
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing outside of me that's true.</v>

6552
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:42.300
<v Speaker 5>Then you see randomness everywhere.</v>

6553
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:43.021
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

6554
02:41:43.021 --> 02:41:44.370
<v Speaker 5>if you believe in correspondence theory,</v>

6555
02:41:44.371 --> 02:41:46.200
<v Speaker 5>that truth is independent of me and you,</v>

6556
02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:47.640
<v Speaker 5>which I think most of us will agree,</v>

6557
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:51.870
<v Speaker 5>then random has doesn't exist in that context because randomness only depends on</v>

6558
02:41:51.871 --> 02:41:54.540
<v Speaker 5>you and when things are true outside of your beliefs,</v>

6559
02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:55.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

6560
02:41:55.260 --> 02:41:57.030
<v Speaker 5>Let's take another classic wool wool term.</v>

6561
02:41:58.340 --> 02:41:58.541
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

6562
02:41:58.541 --> 02:41:59.490
<v Speaker 5>this is a very advanced philosophy.</v>

6563
02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:00.360
<v Speaker 5>I know it sounds crazy,</v>

6564
02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:00.601
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>

6565
02:42:00.601 --> 02:42:01.350
<v Speaker 5>But this is,</v>

6566
02:42:01.350 --> 02:42:01.710
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

6567
02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:03.630
<v Speaker 5>this is what the greatest thinkers in history,</v>

6568
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:04.703
<v Speaker 5>in a report,</v>

6569
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:04.951
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>

6570
02:42:04.951 --> 02:42:06.150
<v Speaker 5>With what they've written down,</v>

6571
02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:07.253
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>

6572
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:08.161
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6573
02:42:08.161 --> 02:42:08.821
<v Speaker 5>See this,</v>

6574
02:42:08.821 --> 02:42:09.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6575
02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:10.320
<v Speaker 5>you see a knife guy.</v>

6576
02:42:10.410 --> 02:42:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at Aristotle's theory of knives.</v>

6577
02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:12.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

6578
02:42:12.430 --> 02:42:12.680
<v Speaker 5>Says,</v>

6579
02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:12.920
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6580
02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:13.470
<v Speaker 5>look at this knife.</v>

6581
02:42:13.470 --> 02:42:14.490
<v Speaker 5>I show you a plastic knife.</v>

6582
02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:15.360
<v Speaker 5>I show you a wooden knife.</v>

6583
02:42:15.361 --> 02:42:16.470
<v Speaker 5>I show you a metal knife,</v>

6584
02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:19.050
<v Speaker 5>I show you five different knives and you're like,</v>

6585
02:42:19.051 --> 02:42:19.830
<v Speaker 5>they're all knives.</v>

6586
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:20.663
<v Speaker 5>All of them are knives.</v>

6587
02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:22.050
<v Speaker 5>You point to them and say their knives.</v>

6588
02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:24.181
<v Speaker 5>Aristotle says,</v>

6589
02:42:24.181 --> 02:42:24.361
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

6590
02:42:24.361 --> 02:42:26.610
<v Speaker 5>they all share in one something,</v>

6591
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:29.100
<v Speaker 5>let's call it the essence that makes them all knives.</v>

6592
02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:31.223
<v Speaker 5>Would you agree?</v>

6593
02:42:31.650 --> 02:42:33.720
<v Speaker 5>The form they all share,</v>

6594
02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.020
<v Speaker 5>they fight draw knife on a paper,</v>

6595
02:42:35.021 --> 02:42:35.970
<v Speaker 5>but like he just drew a knife.</v>

6596
02:42:36.270 --> 02:42:37.500
<v Speaker 5>That knife on the paper,</v>

6597
02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:39.870
<v Speaker 5>share something with a knife made of steel.</v>

6598
02:42:39.871 --> 02:42:42.450
<v Speaker 5>They'll knife made of plastic or the knife made of wood.</v>

6599
02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:43.020
<v Speaker 5>The form.</v>

6600
02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:44.220
<v Speaker 5>There's something about it.</v>

6601
02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:45.600
<v Speaker 5>We call it the essence in philosophy.</v>

6602
02:42:45.630 --> 02:42:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6603
02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:49.860
<v Speaker 5>The four might be confused with what Plato says split or how the whole thing</v>

6604
02:42:49.861 --> 02:42:50.521
<v Speaker 5>about forms,</v>

6605
02:42:50.521 --> 02:42:52.260
<v Speaker 5>but let's call it for now essence.</v>

6606
02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:53.183
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

6607
02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:54.630
<v Speaker 5>If you change the essence,</v>

6608
02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:55.493
<v Speaker 5>you change the thing.</v>

6609
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.210
<v Speaker 5>So if I take that piece of that,</v>

6610
02:42:57.211 --> 02:43:00.100
<v Speaker 5>if I take that plastic a knife and I melt it,</v>

6611
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:01.260
<v Speaker 5>you realize it's not a knife anymore.</v>

6612
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:02.011
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

6613
02:43:02.011 --> 02:43:02.670
<v Speaker 5>What did I do?</v>

6614
02:43:02.670 --> 02:43:03.990
<v Speaker 5>You change that thing about it.</v>

6615
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:07.770
<v Speaker 5>That essence right now,</v>

6616
02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:08.491
<v Speaker 5>that essence,</v>

6617
02:43:08.491 --> 02:43:11.530
<v Speaker 5>does it exist out there in the world or is it only in your head made it up?</v>

6618
02:43:13.210 --> 02:43:13.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6619
02:43:13.511 --> 02:43:14.620
<v Speaker 2>by calling it assence,</v>

6620
02:43:14.621 --> 02:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>you're confusing me,</v>

6621
02:43:15.850 --> 02:43:17.290
<v Speaker 2>so I would call it the form,</v>

6622
02:43:17.770 --> 02:43:18.603
<v Speaker 2>the form of it.</v>

6623
02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It sort of exists in culture that exists in our understanding of these objects</v>

6624
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:24.250
<v Speaker 2>and useful shapes.</v>

6625
02:43:24.310 --> 02:43:24.731
<v Speaker 2>It's you,</v>

6626
02:43:24.731 --> 02:43:25.480
<v Speaker 2>it's your,</v>

6627
02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:26.620
<v Speaker 2>your idea of,</v>

6628
02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.990
<v Speaker 2>of knife conforms to that knife out there.</v>

6629
02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Where's that knife out here?</v>

6630
02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:31.031
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>

6631
02:43:31.031 --> 02:43:31.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6632
02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Bring it out.</v>

6633
02:43:31.810 --> 02:43:32.520
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>

6634
02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

6635
02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:34.000
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously a knife.</v>

6636
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6637
02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6638
02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:37.060
<v Speaker 2>You recognize it or recognize it.</v>

6639
02:43:37.090 --> 02:43:37.923
<v Speaker 2>That's a knife.</v>

6640
02:43:38.050 --> 02:43:38.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6641
02:43:38.231 --> 02:43:39.064
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree.</v>

6642
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Mike.</v>

6643
02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Model of knife.</v>

6644
02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6645
02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:43.570
<v Speaker 2>My model of knife that fits my model,</v>

6646
02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:46.690
<v Speaker 2>but there's some weird looking knives out there too.</v>

6647
02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:47.553
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

6648
02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:49.090
<v Speaker 2>And there might be a knife where we don't agree.</v>

6649
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:50.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the night you think it's a knife.</v>

6650
02:43:50.321 --> 02:43:50.741
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree.</v>

6651
02:43:50.741 --> 02:43:50.920
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6652
02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a sword.</v>

6653
02:43:51.730 --> 02:43:52.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd reached a level of sorts.</v>

6654
02:43:52.810 --> 02:43:53.643
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6655
02:43:54.210 --> 02:43:57.310
<v Speaker 2>You might have a different that that's a great evidence that something in our</v>

6656
02:43:57.311 --> 02:43:59.140
<v Speaker 2>minds that actually objective.</v>

6657
02:43:59.170 --> 02:43:59.411
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

6658
02:43:59.411 --> 02:43:59.591
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

6659
02:43:59.591 --> 02:43:59.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

6660
02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:01.870
<v Speaker 2>They get to the certain length and subjective.</v>

6661
02:44:02.530 --> 02:44:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It's subjective.</v>

6662
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6663
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:04.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6664
02:44:04.690 --> 02:44:05.351
<v Speaker 2>Let's look up matter,</v>

6665
02:44:05.351 --> 02:44:06.820
<v Speaker 2>no matter.</v>

6666
02:44:07.150 --> 02:44:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6667
02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:08.440
<v Speaker 2>It's an inference of the mind.</v>

6668
02:44:08.441 --> 02:44:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Just like the,</v>

6669
02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:10.660
<v Speaker 2>the knife is an inference of the mind</v>

6670
02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:16.870
<v Speaker 2>in terms of subatomic particles and atoms and you see this cup,</v>

6671
02:44:17.770 --> 02:44:18.640
<v Speaker 2>you see this bottle?</v>

6672
02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6673
02:44:19.210 --> 02:44:20.020
<v Speaker 2>You see this clock?</v>

6674
02:44:20.020 --> 02:44:20.853
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6675
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:21.820
<v Speaker 2>You made an inference.</v>

6676
02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:22.930
<v Speaker 2>They all share one thing.</v>

6677
02:44:22.931 --> 02:44:23.620
<v Speaker 2>What did they share?</v>

6678
02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:24.610
<v Speaker 2>All of them share one thing.</v>

6679
02:44:24.611 --> 02:44:25.570
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing they share?</v>

6680
02:44:25.930 --> 02:44:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They share this thing called matter,</v>

6681
02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:29.400
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

6682
02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:30.191
<v Speaker 2>that was an inference.</v>

6683
02:44:30.191 --> 02:44:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Just like we inferred the essence of a knife matter has never been observed in</v>

6684
02:44:34.811 --> 02:44:35.644
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

6685
02:44:35.770 --> 02:44:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Matter is a byproduct of our mind.</v>

6686
02:44:39.610 --> 02:44:41.020
<v Speaker 2>So when you see a tree,</v>

6687
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing matter.</v>

6688
02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:44.073
<v Speaker 2>There's no matter.</v>

6689
02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:44.530
<v Speaker 2>There's only,</v>

6690
02:44:44.530 --> 02:44:46.240
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm inferring matter,</v>

6691
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm observing an image,</v>

6692
02:44:47.790 --> 02:44:48.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6693
02:44:48.130 --> 02:44:49.390
<v Speaker 2>But I'm insuring the matter.</v>

6694
02:44:49.810 --> 02:44:50.301
<v Speaker 2>The matter is,</v>

6695
02:44:50.301 --> 02:44:51.430
<v Speaker 2>it is a mental construct.</v>

6696
02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it a mental construct or is it our inability to see things smaller than what</v>

6697
02:44:59.231 --> 02:45:01.090
<v Speaker 2>is necessary for our survival?</v>

6698
02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Like we can't see Adam's,</v>

6699
02:45:02.861 --> 02:45:04.570
<v Speaker 2>we can't see subatomic particles.</v>

6700
02:45:04.571 --> 02:45:06.580
<v Speaker 2>We can't see them with the naked eye,</v>

6701
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:10.480
<v Speaker 2>but we understand through science that they exist.</v>

6702
02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:12.460
<v Speaker 2>How do you understand that they exist?</v>

6703
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Are you seeing that matter exists out there independently of your mind?</v>

6704
02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Is matter objective or is it dependent on your mind to exist?</v>

6705
02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:23.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not dependent on your mind to exist.</v>

6706
02:45:23.111 --> 02:45:25.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just dependent upon your mind to observe your,</v>

6707
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:28.720
<v Speaker 2>you need your mind to be able to observe matter.</v>

6708
02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:29.591
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6709
02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:31.210
<v Speaker 2>So if you didn't exist,</v>

6710
02:45:31.211 --> 02:45:32.800
<v Speaker 2>do you think this table would exist?</v>

6711
02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:33.311
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

6712
02:45:33.311 --> 02:45:34.144
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

6713
02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6714
02:45:34.810 --> 02:45:36.070
<v Speaker 2>But what would you guess?</v>

6715
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I would guess that all I know if I'm going to use outcomes razor,</v>

6716
02:45:39.611 --> 02:45:39.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6717
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:40.390
<v Speaker 2>if you've heard of aqua,</v>

6718
02:45:40.390 --> 02:45:42.280
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to go to the extreme with Ockham's razor,</v>

6719
02:45:43.570 --> 02:45:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to believe what I observe.</v>

6720
02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6721
02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Kill all the wool.</v>

6722
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Kill it all.</v>

6723
02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:49.510
<v Speaker 2>You've had loved one die,</v>

6724
02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:49.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6725
02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6726
02:45:50.290 --> 02:45:50.891
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has,</v>

6727
02:45:50.891 --> 02:45:51.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6728
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6729
02:45:52.330 --> 02:45:53.920
<v Speaker 2>do you assume that when they die,</v>

6730
02:45:53.921 --> 02:45:55.900
<v Speaker 2>the universe is still the universe?</v>

6731
02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:57.700
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean still the universe?</v>

6732
02:45:57.701 --> 02:46:00.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like the world is the way they are.</v>

6733
02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6734
02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:01.721
<v Speaker 2>the way it is,</v>

6735
02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:05.230
<v Speaker 2>there's trees and grass and dirt and this person dies.</v>

6736
02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:07.030
<v Speaker 2>The trees and grass,</v>

6737
02:46:07.031 --> 02:46:07.391
<v Speaker 2>dirt,</v>

6738
02:46:07.391 --> 02:46:07.991
<v Speaker 2>they don't change.</v>

6739
02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:08.890
<v Speaker 2>They're still the same thing.</v>

6740
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean the nature of the tree would change it?</v>

6741
02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:13.191
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6742
02:46:13.191 --> 02:46:18.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying if you love someone and you know this person and they are no longer</v>

6743
02:46:18.051 --> 02:46:18.884
<v Speaker 4>with us,</v>

6744
02:46:19.310 --> 02:46:22.160
<v Speaker 4>all the things around you like this coughing up and this knife,</v>

6745
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.661
<v Speaker 4>they stayed,</v>

6746
02:46:22.661 --> 02:46:23.540
<v Speaker 4>remained the same.</v>

6747
02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:24.793
<v Speaker 4>They don't change,</v>

6748
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:25.550
<v Speaker 4>they don't change.</v>

6749
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Why would you assume that it would be any different for yourself if you weren't</v>

6750
02:46:29.211 --> 02:46:29.900
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>

6751
02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Why would you think that this table would not exist for the microphone?</v>

6752
02:46:33.441 --> 02:46:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Would not say that's a great argument.</v>

6753
02:46:35.421 --> 02:46:36.254
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that it wouldn't it.</v>

6754
02:46:36.260 --> 02:46:38.000
<v Speaker 4>That's this is what we call hard objectivity.</v>

6755
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:39.740
<v Speaker 4>Something that's hard.</v>

6756
02:46:39.741 --> 02:46:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Objectivity exists without any human mind and exist.</v>

6757
02:46:42.711 --> 02:46:44.150
<v Speaker 4>If all human minds were dead,</v>

6758
02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:48.140
<v Speaker 4>whatever exists still is what we would call philosophers called hard</v>

6759
02:46:48.141 --> 02:46:48.974
<v Speaker 4>objectivity.</v>

6760
02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Now we have objectives it.</v>

6761
02:46:51.050 --> 02:46:51.883
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

6762
02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:53.930
<v Speaker 4>let's look at George Berkeley's example.</v>

6763
02:46:53.931 --> 02:46:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Is that such a great question?</v>

6764
02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Look at a triangle.</v>

6765
02:46:56.060 --> 02:46:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6766
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6767
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Picture a blue triangle.</v>

6768
02:46:59.090 --> 02:46:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

6769
02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:00.373
<v Speaker 4>Picture a green one.</v>

6770
02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:01.491
<v Speaker 4>Picture a black one.</v>

6771
02:47:01.491 --> 02:47:02.324
<v Speaker 4>Picture a white one.</v>

6772
02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:05.000
<v Speaker 4>Can you picture one with no subjective elements?</v>

6773
02:47:05.001 --> 02:47:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Meaning because color is subjective,</v>

6774
02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:07.094
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6775
02:47:07.850 --> 02:47:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Color is a construct of the mind.</v>

6776
02:47:09.711 --> 02:47:11.150
<v Speaker 4>So if I was colorblind,</v>

6777
02:47:11.180 --> 02:47:13.160
<v Speaker 4>this shirt would be a different color to me than it is to you.</v>

6778
02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:13.971
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

6779
02:47:13.971 --> 02:47:15.290
<v Speaker 4>there would still be one shirt.</v>

6780
02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:17.570
<v Speaker 4>It would be objective to a certain degree.</v>

6781
02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:18.433
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

6782
02:47:18.470 --> 02:47:19.880
<v Speaker 4>so triangle has three,</v>

6783
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.983
<v Speaker 4>three sides,</v>

6784
02:47:21.170 --> 02:47:22.003
<v Speaker 4>three corners.</v>

6785
02:47:22.170 --> 02:47:24.090
<v Speaker 4>It adds up to 180 degrees.</v>

6786
02:47:24.210 --> 02:47:25.380
<v Speaker 4>We all agree it.</v>

6787
02:47:25.381 --> 02:47:26.214
<v Speaker 4>Whether you're colorblind,</v>

6788
02:47:26.310 --> 02:47:27.030
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter,</v>

6789
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6790
02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:29.820
<v Speaker 4>There is no subject of element to how many points does it have?</v>

6791
02:47:30.390 --> 02:47:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's going to come in and say to me,</v>

6792
02:47:32.701 --> 02:47:33.620
<v Speaker 4>triangles have three,</v>

6793
02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:34.380
<v Speaker 4>four sites.</v>

6794
02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:34.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6795
02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:35.371
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

6796
02:47:35.371 --> 02:47:36.570
<v Speaker 4>that's not a triangle.</v>

6797
02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:38.100
<v Speaker 4>There's not three angles to that.</v>

6798
02:47:38.610 --> 02:47:39.121
<v Speaker 4>You've not.</v>

6799
02:47:39.121 --> 02:47:41.430
<v Speaker 4>You've gone past it a little cool understanding.</v>

6800
02:47:42.060 --> 02:47:42.271
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

6801
02:47:42.271 --> 02:47:44.160
<v Speaker 4>so can you,</v>

6802
02:47:44.310 --> 02:47:45.121
<v Speaker 4>George Berkeley says,</v>

6803
02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:48.420
<v Speaker 4>can you picture a triangle without any subjective element,</v>

6804
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:49.350
<v Speaker 4>without any color?</v>

6805
02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:50.280
<v Speaker 4>Let's call it color.</v>

6806
02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:51.113
<v Speaker 4>To make it really simple,</v>

6807
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.480
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

6808
02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:52.313
<v Speaker 4>really obvious.</v>

6809
02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:55.230
<v Speaker 4>Can you picture a triangle without any color?</v>

6810
02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:59.190
<v Speaker 4>You would have to have it in contrast to something so that you could see it.</v>

6811
02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had a say,</v>

6812
02:48:02.121 --> 02:48:03.770
<v Speaker 4>if you had a purple curtain,</v>

6813
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:05.120
<v Speaker 4>like what we have behind us,</v>

6814
02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:07.520
<v Speaker 4>and out of that Purple Carton,</v>

6815
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:08.780
<v Speaker 4>we cut a triangle.</v>

6816
02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Even if there was no color,</v>

6817
02:48:11.690 --> 02:48:12.950
<v Speaker 4>if it was just clear,</v>

6818
02:48:13.410 --> 02:48:14.270
<v Speaker 4>you would be able to see.</v>

6819
02:48:14.271 --> 02:48:16.400
<v Speaker 4>You'd be able to differentiate between that shape,</v>

6820
02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:21.110
<v Speaker 4>but she needed that purple curtain to differentiate so we cannot have it without</v>

6821
02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:22.160
<v Speaker 4>subjective element.</v>

6822
02:48:22.310 --> 02:48:23.240
<v Speaker 4>This was Berkeley's point.</v>

6823
02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:24.103
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what you said.</v>

6824
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.680
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

6825
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:25.513
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

6826
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Every objective thing we've observed in the universe has,</v>

6827
02:48:29.671 --> 02:48:31.430
<v Speaker 4>this is made up of subjective elements.</v>

6828
02:48:31.930 --> 02:48:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Even when you draw the number one on a blackboard,</v>

6829
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:37.570
<v Speaker 4>it has to be a color as to be something that has to be a contrast.</v>

6830
02:48:37.571 --> 02:48:37.981
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

6831
02:48:37.981 --> 02:48:38.520
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

6832
02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:39.353
<v Speaker 4>He said it beautifully.</v>

6833
02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:44.710
<v Speaker 4>All our objective elements or mental constructs,</v>

6834
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:46.400
<v Speaker 4>three sides.</v>

6835
02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.250
<v Speaker 4>The idea of side is a mental construct.</v>

6836
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:50.770
<v Speaker 4>The idea of a point is a mental construct.</v>

6837
02:48:50.771 --> 02:48:53.290
<v Speaker 4>The idea of 180 degrees is mathematical.</v>

6838
02:48:53.291 --> 02:48:54.910
<v Speaker 4>It's happening in your mind somewhere.</v>

6839
02:48:55.810 --> 02:48:56.830
<v Speaker 4>They're being observed.</v>

6840
02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:02.040
<v Speaker 4>You can draw it and I can see it and I can repeat it and you can teach it to me</v>

6841
02:49:02.051 --> 02:49:04.450
<v Speaker 4>and I can teach it to someone else like these are,</v>

6842
02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:06.010
<v Speaker 4>they may be mental constructs,</v>

6843
02:49:06.011 --> 02:49:08.130
<v Speaker 4>but they're provable mental that</v>

6844
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:08.963
<v Speaker 2>are repeatable.</v>

6845
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:09.833
<v Speaker 2>So there we were.</v>

6846
02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Sharing agreement is a real thing.</v>

6847
02:49:11.370 --> 02:49:15.570
<v Speaker 2>We're in agreement that mathematic is a mental construct and it's true.</v>

6848
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:17.400
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely by the finish and truth.</v>

6849
02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:19.850
<v Speaker 2>So it was both a mental construct and trust,</v>

6850
02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:22.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's not outside out there in the world.</v>

6851
02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:23.633
<v Speaker 2>It's within.</v>

6852
02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:27.420
<v Speaker 2>But if you make a triangle on the ground,</v>

6853
02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:28.890
<v Speaker 2>it's in the world.</v>

6854
02:49:30.210 --> 02:49:33.450
<v Speaker 2>The numbers are in your head and the subjective element is in the world.</v>

6855
02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:35.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a two way street.</v>

6856
02:49:36.390 --> 02:49:39.030
<v Speaker 2>The subjective element is in the world,</v>

6857
02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:40.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's a triangle.</v>

6858
02:49:40.610 --> 02:49:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6859
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:42.060
<v Speaker 2>so how's it in your head?</v>

6860
02:49:43.050 --> 02:49:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Because you,</v>

6861
02:49:43.891 --> 02:49:45.030
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a triangle,</v>

6862
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:48.510
<v Speaker 2>the subjective elements,</v>

6863
02:49:49.770 --> 02:49:51.270
<v Speaker 2>when you observe them in your mind,</v>

6864
02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:55.290
<v Speaker 2>your mind points out different objective elements of that triangle.</v>

6865
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:57.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's dependent on your mind.</v>

6866
02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:58.050
<v Speaker 2>By that argument,</v>

6867
02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 2>the entire universe is dependent on your mind.</v>

6868
02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely no doubt about it.</v>

6869
02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:02.820
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to use OCKHAM's razor,</v>

6870
02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:03.390
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

6871
02:50:03.390 --> 02:50:04.440
<v Speaker 2>but not everyday language.</v>

6872
02:50:04.470 --> 02:50:05.160
<v Speaker 2>We use an outcomes.</v>

6873
02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:05.971
<v Speaker 2>Let's take away everything.</v>

6874
02:50:05.971 --> 02:50:07.650
<v Speaker 2>We're not sure of everything that has a doubt.</v>

6875
02:50:07.651 --> 02:50:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of it.</v>

6876
02:50:08.310 --> 02:50:09.143
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

6877
02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of everything with a sliver of the La you ever heard or read.</v>

6878
02:50:11.450 --> 02:50:14.460
<v Speaker 2>The problem and they can't matter itself as a sliver of doubt.</v>

6879
02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

6880
02:50:15.210 --> 02:50:15.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6881
02:50:15.511 --> 02:50:19.980
<v Speaker 2>when you have subatomic particles that you know they exist in two different</v>

6882
02:50:19.981 --> 02:50:21.270
<v Speaker 2>states simultaneously.</v>

6883
02:50:21.271 --> 02:50:25.560
<v Speaker 2>They're both spinning and still there in superstates Berkeley would tell you</v>

6884
02:50:25.561 --> 02:50:27.870
<v Speaker 2>those are images of subatomic particles.</v>

6885
02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:28.510
<v Speaker 2>They're not mum.</v>

6886
02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Some of sub atomic particles independent of your mind.</v>

6887
02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6888
02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with Sean Carroll about it.</v>

6889
02:50:36.581 --> 02:50:38.460
<v Speaker 2>It was a physicist and he made it familiar,</v>

6890
02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:40.980
<v Speaker 2>even more muddy to me.</v>

6891
02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:42.161
<v Speaker 2>I thought I,</v>

6892
02:50:42.161 --> 02:50:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was crazy before I talked to him and then when I talked to him,</v>

6893
02:50:45.540 --> 02:50:46.373
<v Speaker 2>he's brilliant,</v>

6894
02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:47.213
<v Speaker 2>he's brilliant.</v>

6895
02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:52.220
<v Speaker 2>He's essentially saying that subatomic particles don't blink in and out of</v>

6896
02:50:52.561 --> 02:50:53.400
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

6897
02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's just we,</v>

6898
02:50:55.590 --> 02:51:00.590
<v Speaker 2>it's the way we're looking at them and that they exist in this just bizarre</v>

6899
02:51:00.871 --> 02:51:01.704
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

6900
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:05.610
<v Speaker 2>but they exist in this state in a way that it's very difficult for us to use</v>

6901
02:51:05.611 --> 02:51:07.200
<v Speaker 2>normal language to sort of explain.</v>

6902
02:51:07.201 --> 02:51:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6903
02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:08.041
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6904
02:51:08.041 --> 02:51:08.821
<v Speaker 2>that's the true issue.</v>

6905
02:51:08.821 --> 02:51:09.910
<v Speaker 2>But you know what a,</v>

6906
02:51:09.970 --> 02:51:10.801
<v Speaker 2>I might have fucked.</v>

6907
02:51:10.801 --> 02:51:13.560
<v Speaker 2>He's probably listening to this was like you fucking dummy.</v>

6908
02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:14.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6909
02:51:14.401 --> 02:51:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and what I said again,</v>

6910
02:51:15.810 --> 02:51:16.560
<v Speaker 2>you know what is,</v>

6911
02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.390
<v Speaker 2>what a great w one great conversation.</v>

6912
02:51:18.391 --> 02:51:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I heard a conversation between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris,</v>

6913
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.981
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

6914
02:51:21.981 --> 02:51:23.190
<v Speaker 2>the conversation about truth.</v>

6915
02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

6916
02:51:23.850 --> 02:51:24.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6917
02:51:24.071 --> 02:51:25.020
<v Speaker 2>that drove me crazy.</v>

6918
02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I think we could do better though.</v>

6919
02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:26.881
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6920
02:51:26.881 --> 02:51:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I think they could have done better to the moderator.</v>

6921
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.431
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6922
02:51:29.431 --> 02:51:29.910
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

6923
02:51:29.910 --> 02:51:30.743
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6924
02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you need to get to know each other personally first?</v>

6925
02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:33.781
<v Speaker 2>They never met,</v>

6926
02:51:33.781 --> 02:51:34.350
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

6927
02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:34.950
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6928
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:36.390
<v Speaker 2>that's fireworks,</v>

6929
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:37.224
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6930
02:51:38.250 --> 02:51:39.420
<v Speaker 2>That was such a great conversation.</v>

6931
02:51:39.421 --> 02:51:40.440
<v Speaker 2>But here's my question.</v>

6932
02:51:41.190 --> 02:51:44.190
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between knowledge and belief?</v>

6933
02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of what we said is kind of muddy.</v>

6934
02:51:45.991 --> 02:51:46.141
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6935
02:51:46.141 --> 02:51:46.950
<v Speaker 2>let's make it suit.</v>

6936
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:47.371
<v Speaker 2>Let's make,</v>

6937
02:51:47.371 --> 02:51:49.560
<v Speaker 2>let's make the water's crystal clear as much as possible.</v>

6938
02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:50.513
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6939
02:51:51.090 --> 02:51:54.300
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference between knowledge and belief?</v>

6940
02:51:54.690 --> 02:51:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6941
02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:58.110
<v Speaker 2>the belief that the gremlins are pulling down on people,</v>

6942
02:51:58.111 --> 02:51:59.550
<v Speaker 2>which is why we have gravity.</v>

6943
02:51:59.730 --> 02:52:00.990
<v Speaker 2>That would be a belief.</v>

6944
02:52:01.050 --> 02:52:01.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6945
02:52:01.291 --> 02:52:02.124
<v Speaker 2>they're both beliefs.</v>

6946
02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6947
02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

6948
02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:03.960
<v Speaker 2>gravity's not knowledge.</v>

6949
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.823
<v Speaker 2>It's a belief.</v>

6950
02:52:05.050 --> 02:52:05.391
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6951
02:52:05.391 --> 02:52:06.790
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about Graham ones.</v>

6952
02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say that's knowledge or that that's a belief.</v>

6953
02:52:10.421 --> 02:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Belief,</v>

6954
02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:12.070
<v Speaker 2>knowledges.</v>

6955
02:52:12.071 --> 02:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>If I throw water on your,</v>

6956
02:52:13.211 --> 02:52:14.044
<v Speaker 2>you get wet.</v>

6957
02:52:14.690 --> 02:52:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

6958
02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:17.290
<v Speaker 2>How would say that's belief to believe?</v>

6959
02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6960
02:52:17.770 --> 02:52:22.060
<v Speaker 2>So maybe one day I throw water on you and you to show me that you're Jesus and</v>

6961
02:52:22.061 --> 02:52:24.100
<v Speaker 2>the water just goes right through you and it does.</v>

6962
02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:25.450
<v Speaker 2>The reason why you believe of water,</v>

6963
02:52:25.451 --> 02:52:27.940
<v Speaker 2>it would make me wet is because it happened in the past.</v>

6964
02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Now you think that the future is going to behave like the past.</v>

6965
02:52:30.311 --> 02:52:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Just like Aristotle saw the sun go around the earth and he thought that this is</v>

6966
02:52:33.161 --> 02:52:33.880
<v Speaker 2>going to happen everyday.</v>

6967
02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:34.960
<v Speaker 2>He didn't understand.</v>

6968
02:52:34.990 --> 02:52:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

6969
02:52:35.430 --> 02:52:36.210
<v Speaker 2>It's optical illusion.</v>

6970
02:52:36.210 --> 02:52:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

6971
02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:36.990
<v Speaker 2>let me go.</v>

6972
02:52:36.990 --> 02:52:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you a better is though.</v>

6973
02:52:38.321 --> 02:52:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's each to throw it out.</v>

6974
02:52:39.761 --> 02:52:40.480
<v Speaker 2>She get wet.</v>

6975
02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:41.530
<v Speaker 2>All flamingos are pink.</v>

6976
02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:42.610
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

6977
02:52:42.610 --> 02:52:43.443
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

6978
02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know that all the time.</v>

6979
02:52:44.501 --> 02:52:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Did we?</v>

6980
02:52:45.010 --> 02:52:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Then we went to Australia.</v>

6981
02:52:45.911 --> 02:52:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same food source.</v>

6982
02:52:47.171 --> 02:52:48.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same food sorts of their black here.</v>

6983
02:52:48.701 --> 02:52:49.534
<v Speaker 2>They're white here.</v>

6984
02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:50.710
<v Speaker 2>They have a different food source.</v>

6985
02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Flamingos are not inherently pink.</v>

6986
02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:56.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a scientific fact can always be overturned.</v>

6987
02:52:57.400 --> 02:52:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

6988
02:52:57.630 --> 02:52:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

6989
02:52:58.541 --> 02:52:59.920
<v Speaker 2>He threw a water and didn't get wet.</v>

6990
02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6991
02:53:00.610 --> 02:53:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but this is not just because it's a,</v>

6992
02:53:03.130 --> 02:53:04.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a certain coding.</v>

6993
02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6994
02:53:05.350 --> 02:53:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I got you.</v>

6995
02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.560
<v Speaker 2>But if he's got that over his body,</v>

6996
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:08.590
<v Speaker 2>not going to be able to breathe.</v>

6997
02:53:08.770 --> 02:53:09.041
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6998
02:53:09.041 --> 02:53:09.874
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>

6999
02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:11.740
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen fire before.</v>

7000
02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:14.380
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen five K and human being.</v>

7001
02:53:14.410 --> 02:53:16.960
<v Speaker 2>You've been being warmed by electric blankets your entire life.</v>

7002
02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7003
02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Then you see a flame and you don't know.</v>

7004
02:53:19.690 --> 02:53:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Can you know that that flame is going to burn you if you touch it logically or</v>

7005
02:53:22.301 --> 02:53:23.740
<v Speaker 2>is it only via experience?</v>

7006
02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Through history,</v>

7007
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:26.650
<v Speaker 2>developing a history or relationship with fire.</v>

7008
02:53:26.890 --> 02:53:28.780
<v Speaker 2>A bird you once at burns you twice.</v>

7009
02:53:28.781 --> 02:53:29.021
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

7010
02:53:29.021 --> 02:53:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

7011
02:53:29.430 --> 02:53:31.270
<v Speaker 2>but I think the future is going to behave like the past.</v>

7012
02:53:31.310 --> 02:53:31.931
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna touch that.</v>

7013
02:53:31.931 --> 02:53:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Folk who know that fire burns you and they've never been burned by fire because</v>

7014
02:53:36.311 --> 02:53:40.510
<v Speaker 2>they went to school and they learn from people who explain the properties of</v>

7015
02:53:40.511 --> 02:53:41.051
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

7016
02:53:41.051 --> 02:53:41.920
<v Speaker 2>what it is,</v>

7017
02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:43.060
<v Speaker 2>how it works,</v>

7018
02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:44.680
<v Speaker 2>what temperature it operates on,</v>

7019
02:53:44.681 --> 02:53:47.700
<v Speaker 2>how it's different depending upon the color of it or what's burning.</v>

7020
02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Borrowed history,</v>

7021
02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:49.420
<v Speaker 2>borrowed history.</v>

7022
02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:50.253
<v Speaker 2>It's still history.</v>

7023
02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Borrowed history.</v>

7024
02:53:51.671 --> 02:53:54.130
<v Speaker 2>How you learned from my mistakes of touching fire.</v>

7025
02:53:54.310 --> 02:53:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7026
02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:57.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's still known VR experience for your history.</v>

7027
02:53:58.780 --> 02:53:59.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7028
02:53:59.081 --> 02:54:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's known via science.</v>

7029
02:54:00.401 --> 02:54:05.110
<v Speaker 2>If you explain exactly what the elements of the fire are and how it works and</v>

7030
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:08.920
<v Speaker 2>what it burns at and what temperature specific things need to burn out,</v>

7031
02:54:08.921 --> 02:54:11.080
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to get burned to know that it will burn you.</v>

7032
02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:12.813
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7033
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7034
02:54:13.181 --> 02:54:15.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's how we discovered fire burns by testing it,</v>

7035
02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.470
<v Speaker 2>not via logical deduction.</v>

7036
02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:18.041
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7037
02:54:18.041 --> 02:54:18.581
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

7038
02:54:18.581 --> 02:54:19.414
<v Speaker 2>It's only history.</v>

7039
02:54:20.110 --> 02:54:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Science is pattern is irregularities found in nature.</v>

7040
02:54:22.931 --> 02:54:23.770
<v Speaker 2>We observe nature.</v>

7041
02:54:23.771 --> 02:54:25.300
<v Speaker 2>We see these patterns and regularities.</v>

7042
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7043
02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:27.580
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what's causing them.</v>

7044
02:54:27.850 --> 02:54:28.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7045
02:54:28.001 --> 02:54:29.110
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that day cards.</v>

7046
02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Original idea about science in the first place was using measurement to sort of</v>

7047
02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:42.540
<v Speaker 2>understand nature well was on one of his original concepts of establishing</v>

7048
02:54:42.701 --> 02:54:43.690
<v Speaker 2>science in the first place.</v>

7049
02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:43.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7050
02:54:43.871 --> 02:54:45.010
<v Speaker 2>his original concept was it.</v>

7051
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:45.280
<v Speaker 2>They look,</v>

7052
02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:46.210
<v Speaker 2>science is doubtable.</v>

7053
02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:48.430
<v Speaker 2>He said that science is doubtable.</v>

7054
02:54:48.431 --> 02:54:48.531
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

7055
02:54:48.531 --> 02:54:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

7056
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's called Cartesian dealt in extreme level of doubt.</v>

7057
02:54:51.580 --> 02:54:53.380
<v Speaker 2>He says those are all beliefs.</v>

7058
02:54:53.530 --> 02:54:54.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any knowledge.</v>

7059
02:54:54.371 --> 02:54:54.630
<v Speaker 2>What do I,</v>

7060
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:55.463
<v Speaker 2>what do I know?</v>

7061
02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Because knowledge means zero chance of being wrong.</v>

7062
02:54:58.030 --> 02:54:58.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7063
02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:00.100
<v Speaker 2>zero chance of being wrong.</v>

7064
02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Give me one scientific fact.</v>

7065
02:55:01.661 --> 02:55:04.370
<v Speaker 2>You truly trust 100% okay.</v>

7066
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:09.490
<v Speaker 5>If I take a match and I take a yellow piece of paper from this particular</v>

7067
02:55:10.851 --> 02:55:11.540
<v Speaker 5>notebook,</v>

7068
02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:14.270
<v Speaker 5>I will light that motherfucker file at that match.</v>

7069
02:55:14.540 --> 02:55:15.440
<v Speaker 5>That's a fact.</v>

7070
02:55:15.470 --> 02:55:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7071
02:55:16.130 --> 02:55:17.690
<v Speaker 5>That's a site that we fact is it?</v>

7072
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7073
02:55:18.350 --> 02:55:19.550
<v Speaker 5>it's a scientific fact,</v>

7074
02:55:19.700 --> 02:55:22.790
<v Speaker 5>but it's not higher than hypothesis is just hypothesis you up.</v>

7075
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.361
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

7076
02:55:23.361 --> 02:55:26.270
<v Speaker 5>Because every time you've seen a fire touch of piece of paper,</v>

7077
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:27.343
<v Speaker 5>it burned it.</v>

7078
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:32.650
<v Speaker 5>So you're relying on your historical experiences essentially saying there's no</v>

7079
02:55:33.261 --> 02:55:35.000
<v Speaker 5>scientific fact possible.</v>

7080
02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Only to the level of hypothesis we can,</v>

7081
02:55:37.591 --> 02:55:37.700
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

7082
02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:39.320
<v Speaker 5>this is not me talking and this is Thomas Quinn.</v>

7083
02:55:39.390 --> 02:55:40.041
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't be saying,</v>

7084
02:55:40.041 --> 02:55:40.874
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7085
02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:41.331
<v Speaker 5>he's saying,</v>

7086
02:55:41.331 --> 02:55:42.164
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7087
02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:43.970
<v Speaker 5>we have two phases in science,</v>

7088
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:45.021
<v Speaker 5>standards,</v>

7089
02:55:45.021 --> 02:55:45.381
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>

7090
02:55:45.381 --> 02:55:46.910
<v Speaker 5>and then a scientific revolution.</v>

7091
02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:47.990
<v Speaker 5>What Standard Science?</v>

7092
02:55:47.991 --> 02:55:48.141
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7093
02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:50.150
<v Speaker 5>whatever the flavor of the day is.</v>

7094
02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:51.913
<v Speaker 5>Let's say today it's,</v>

7095
02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:53.570
<v Speaker 5>let's hit the dates evolution,</v>

7096
02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:55.161
<v Speaker 5>and then he said,</v>

7097
02:55:55.161 --> 02:55:55.700
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7098
02:55:55.700 --> 02:55:58.040
<v Speaker 5>every every piece of information that we receive,</v>

7099
02:55:58.041 --> 02:55:59.300
<v Speaker 5>we interpreted through that Lens.</v>

7100
02:55:59.300 --> 02:56:00.290
<v Speaker 5>He called it a paradigm.</v>

7101
02:56:00.350 --> 02:56:04.940
<v Speaker 5>We look at the information through the lens of evolution so it makes sense.</v>

7102
02:56:04.941 --> 02:56:06.890
<v Speaker 5>It fits right here in our story of evolution,</v>

7103
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:07.783
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7104
02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:08.781
<v Speaker 5>And then he says,</v>

7105
02:56:08.781 --> 02:56:08.961
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7106
02:56:08.961 --> 02:56:12.900
<v Speaker 5>a small amount of contradictory information is gonna Pool.</v>

7107
02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:13.753
<v Speaker 5>Slowly</v>

7108
02:56:15.470 --> 02:56:16.161
<v Speaker 5>it's inevitable.</v>

7109
02:56:16.161 --> 02:56:16.994
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

7110
02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:18.980
<v Speaker 5>and then this,</v>

7111
02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:19.641
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna ignore it.</v>

7112
02:56:19.641 --> 02:56:20.480
<v Speaker 5>We're going to sweep it under the rug.</v>

7113
02:56:20.481 --> 02:56:21.410
<v Speaker 5>Everything doesn't make sense.</v>

7114
02:56:21.411 --> 02:56:22.550
<v Speaker 5>We're going to sweep it under the rug.</v>

7115
02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:24.591
<v Speaker 5>And then one day,</v>

7116
02:56:24.591 --> 02:56:26.640
<v Speaker 5>that level of information that,</v>

7117
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:30.350
<v Speaker 5>that amount of information that doesn't fit in any way with our theory or</v>

7118
02:56:30.351 --> 02:56:33.530
<v Speaker 5>current theory is going to pull and pull and pull and pull until one guy comes</v>

7119
02:56:33.531 --> 02:56:33.951
<v Speaker 5>around and says,</v>

7120
02:56:33.951 --> 02:56:34.520
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

7121
02:56:34.520 --> 02:56:35.271
<v Speaker 5>we had a backwards.</v>

7122
02:56:35.271 --> 02:56:36.104
<v Speaker 5>Are we headed the wrong?</v>

7123
02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:39.350
<v Speaker 5>It's this and now all this new information fits in the new theory.</v>

7124
02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:40.640
<v Speaker 5>All the old stuff fits in.</v>

7125
02:56:40.641 --> 02:56:41.780
<v Speaker 5>All the new stuff fits.</v>

7126
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:44.150
<v Speaker 5>And that's called the scientific revolution.</v>

7127
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:44.801
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

7128
02:56:44.801 --> 02:56:47.630
<v Speaker 5>science scientists always going through a normal phase and then a revolution</v>

7129
02:56:47.631 --> 02:56:51.920
<v Speaker 5>phase and man is becoming more and more precise but will never reach the level</v>

7130
02:56:51.921 --> 02:56:53.180
<v Speaker 5>of past hypothesis.</v>

7131
02:56:53.181 --> 02:56:54.014
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

7132
02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Because science is based on our faith that their pass,</v>

7133
02:56:59.270 --> 02:56:59.631
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

7134
02:56:59.631 --> 02:57:02.360
<v Speaker 5>that the future will behave like the past.</v>

7135
02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:04.880
<v Speaker 5>We only know things via experience,</v>

7136
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:05.900
<v Speaker 5>VR history,</v>

7137
02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:07.700
<v Speaker 5>so when I flipped that coin,</v>

7138
02:57:07.850 --> 02:57:11.330
<v Speaker 5>you have no idea what's going to happen until I flipped many coins in front of</v>

7139
02:57:11.331 --> 02:57:12.260
<v Speaker 5>you or I give you my,</v>

7140
02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:13.700
<v Speaker 5>if you trust me and I tell you what,</v>

7141
02:57:13.910 --> 02:57:14.211
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

7142
02:57:14.211 --> 02:57:15.021
<v Speaker 5>I did this experiment.</v>

7143
02:57:15.021 --> 02:57:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Here are my results and you trust me.</v>

7144
02:57:16.191 --> 02:57:17.090
<v Speaker 5>You just take it for granted.</v>

7145
02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:18.620
<v Speaker 5>You take it on way of authority.</v>

7146
02:57:18.770 --> 02:57:20.480
<v Speaker 5>I agree with everything you said.</v>

7147
02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:23.810
<v Speaker 5>I still don't see where you're saying science has so much.</v>

7148
02:57:23.811 --> 02:57:24.190
<v Speaker 5>Whew.</v>

7149
02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:24.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7150
02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Or science has as much woo as healers or crystals,</v>

7151
02:57:28.621 --> 02:57:30.020
<v Speaker 5>suckers or listen,</v>

7152
02:57:30.021 --> 02:57:31.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in crystals in any of that.</v>

7153
02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:32.330
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't.</v>

7154
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.591
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

7155
02:57:32.591 --> 02:57:32.961
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

7156
02:57:32.961 --> 02:57:33.320
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

7157
02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:35.330
<v Speaker 5>I have a higher standard of skepticism.</v>

7158
02:57:35.390 --> 02:57:36.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm missing the Wu though.</v>

7159
02:57:36.490 --> 02:57:37.100
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

7160
02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:39.620
<v Speaker 5>The Wu is when we project physical laws,</v>

7161
02:57:41.090 --> 02:57:41.720
<v Speaker 5>combustion,</v>

7162
02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:42.410
<v Speaker 5>electricity,</v>

7163
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:43.243
<v Speaker 5>gravity,</v>

7164
02:57:43.250 --> 02:57:44.720
<v Speaker 5>these are all appealed to magic.</v>

7165
02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:46.370
<v Speaker 5>Can you demonstrate these,</v>

7166
02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:50.120
<v Speaker 5>these physical laws or are they byproducts?</v>

7167
02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:52.460
<v Speaker 5>Are they,</v>

7168
02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:56.510
<v Speaker 5>are they inferences you made in your mind because you've seen a certain pattern</v>

7169
02:57:56.511 --> 02:57:57.344
<v Speaker 5>over and over again.</v>

7170
02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:01.160
<v Speaker 5>That law doesn't exist out there in the universe.</v>

7171
02:58:01.170 --> 02:58:02.100
<v Speaker 5>It's only a bookmark.</v>

7172
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:05.130
<v Speaker 2>It's only a name we have for a pattern we've observed in nature.</v>

7173
02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:07.770
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty heavy stuff.</v>

7174
02:58:07.771 --> 02:58:12.570
<v Speaker 2>I know it's only a name for a pattern exactly that we've observed that exists in</v>

7175
02:58:12.571 --> 02:58:12.961
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

7176
02:58:12.961 --> 02:58:13.351
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

7177
02:58:13.351 --> 02:58:17.010
<v Speaker 2>so that means you can't label anything ever because the everything is just a</v>

7178
02:58:17.011 --> 02:58:18.390
<v Speaker 2>pattern that we've observed in nature.</v>

7179
02:58:18.391 --> 02:58:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

7180
02:58:18.650 --> 02:58:19.441
<v Speaker 2>Everything is a pattern.</v>

7181
02:58:19.441 --> 02:58:19.921
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>

7182
02:58:19.921 --> 02:58:21.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no logic behind.</v>

7183
02:58:21.151 --> 02:58:21.984
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's neurologic.</v>

7184
02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:23.550
<v Speaker 2>We give an explanation,</v>

7185
02:58:23.551 --> 02:58:24.780
<v Speaker 2>we give a narrative to it.</v>

7186
02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:25.733
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7187
02:58:26.130 --> 02:58:28.860
<v Speaker 2>but that narrative is just our paradigm.</v>

7188
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Comscore would say that's the shades you're wearing.</v>

7189
02:58:31.650 --> 02:58:32.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7190
02:58:32.130 --> 02:58:32.721
<v Speaker 2>that's you.</v>

7191
02:58:32.721 --> 02:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't set a beautiful,</v>

7192
02:58:33.961 --> 02:58:34.171
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

7193
02:58:34.171 --> 02:58:34.680
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

7194
02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:36.360
<v Speaker 2>you have pink tinted glasses.</v>

7195
02:58:36.930 --> 02:58:38.310
<v Speaker 2>You could have blue tinted glasses,</v>

7196
02:58:38.970 --> 02:58:40.140
<v Speaker 2>but whatever glasses you're wearing,</v>

7197
02:58:40.141 --> 02:58:41.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the song and dance.</v>

7198
02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:41.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

7199
02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:42.301
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

7200
02:58:42.301 --> 02:58:45.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the story you tell yourself of why those things are happening,</v>

7201
02:58:45.061 --> 02:58:45.894
<v Speaker 2>the way they're happening.</v>

7202
02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:46.733
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7203
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:50.700
<v Speaker 2>The truth of the matter is all we're seeing is one pattern happening over and</v>

7204
02:58:50.701 --> 02:58:51.534
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

7205
02:58:51.540 --> 02:58:52.281
<v Speaker 2>So what this is,</v>

7206
02:58:52.281 --> 02:58:54.540
<v Speaker 2>is essentially as an intellectual exercise,</v>

7207
02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:59.460
<v Speaker 2>but the reality of our ability to come up,</v>

7208
02:58:59.461 --> 02:59:00.294
<v Speaker 2>well not ours,</v>

7209
02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:04.020
<v Speaker 2>obviously super smart people come up with the very technology that we're using</v>

7210
02:59:04.021 --> 02:59:09.021
<v Speaker 2>right now to broadcast this podcast means that they have figured things out,</v>

7211
02:59:09.961 --> 02:59:14.961
<v Speaker 2>that there are provable and that you can use science to determine what frequency</v>

7212
02:59:15.301 --> 02:59:16.290
<v Speaker 2>things need to be,</v>

7213
02:59:16.291 --> 02:59:18.420
<v Speaker 2>how much electricity you need,</v>

7214
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:21.570
<v Speaker 2>what kind of components can you know,</v>

7215
02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:26.660
<v Speaker 2>take the image and projected through the power lines and through the Internet</v>

7216
02:59:27.211 --> 02:59:31.260
<v Speaker 2>coat cables and all the different things that we need to be in place to provide</v>

7217
02:59:31.261 --> 02:59:33.450
<v Speaker 2>the electricity to provide the Internet connection.</v>

7218
02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:34.920
<v Speaker 2>That's all science.</v>

7219
02:59:34.921 --> 02:59:36.420
<v Speaker 2>So this is all predictive sciences,</v>

7220
02:59:36.450 --> 02:59:37.021
<v Speaker 2>predictive,</v>

7221
02:59:37.021 --> 02:59:37.261
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7222
02:59:37.261 --> 02:59:37.980
<v Speaker 2>But this is all,</v>

7223
02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:40.710
<v Speaker 2>these are all things that are not just observable,</v>

7224
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:41.760
<v Speaker 2>but they're repeatable,</v>

7225
02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:42.271
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7226
02:59:42.271 --> 02:59:42.691
<v Speaker 2>The pattern.</v>

7227
02:59:42.691 --> 02:59:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Where's the woo here?</v>

7228
02:59:44.381 --> 02:59:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>

7229
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:45.480
<v Speaker 2>here's where the rule is.</v>

7230
02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:46.313
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7231
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Our explanation for why it happens,</v>

7232
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:51.380
<v Speaker 2>the laws of nature are woo.</v>

7233
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:53.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not woo is,</v>

7234
02:59:53.360 --> 02:59:57.690
<v Speaker 2>are our words that we use to describe repeatable things.</v>

7235
02:59:58.830 --> 02:59:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7236
02:59:59.370 --> 03:00:00.121
<v Speaker 2>Which which,</v>

7237
03:00:00.121 --> 03:00:04.110
<v Speaker 2>which law of which force of of of nature are you referring to?</v>

7238
03:00:04.111 --> 03:00:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's pick one.</v>

7239
03:00:04.930 --> 03:00:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Lucky,</v>

7240
03:00:05.170 --> 03:00:05.641
<v Speaker 2>random miss.</v>

7241
03:00:05.641 --> 03:00:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Can you show?</v>

7242
03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that is a force of nature.</v>

7243
03:00:08.010 --> 03:00:08.211
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7244
03:00:08.211 --> 03:00:08.941
<v Speaker 2>so three with you.</v>

7245
03:00:08.941 --> 03:00:09.810
<v Speaker 2>That randomness.</v>

7246
03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:11.370
<v Speaker 2>The idea of randomness.</v>

7247
03:00:11.430 --> 03:00:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7248
03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Pick one because they use it.</v>

7249
03:00:13.201 --> 03:00:13.920
<v Speaker 2>They say it's,</v>

7250
03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:18.920
<v Speaker 2>it's evolution of a natural section via a random selection of temperature.</v>

7251
03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Temperature.</v>

7252
03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7253
03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7254
03:00:22.350 --> 03:00:24.330
<v Speaker 2>What causes to I observe temperature like you,</v>

7255
03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I believe temperature exists.</v>

7256
03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:27.510
<v Speaker 2>What causes temperature?</v>

7257
03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:28.673
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

7258
03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:34.790
<v Speaker 2>That's true and we don't know we you and I don't know [inaudible] they don't</v>

7259
03:00:34.831 --> 03:00:38.610
<v Speaker 2>have any idea what causes only tell me about the patterns and regularities.</v>

7260
03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:39.091
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

7261
03:00:39.091 --> 03:00:43.920
<v Speaker 2>That friction causes certain things that the magnetic pull of the sun on the</v>

7262
03:00:43.921 --> 03:00:48.000
<v Speaker 2>earth causes a certain temperature shifts and the these are recognizable and</v>

7263
03:00:48.001 --> 03:00:50.340
<v Speaker 2>repeatable and they understand how to measure them.</v>

7264
03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:55.620
<v Speaker 2>These are all just patterns and regularities found in nature and they're giving</v>

7265
03:00:55.621 --> 03:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>them names and explanations.</v>

7266
03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

7267
03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Isn't explanations be debunked later on?</v>

7268
03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I put them in the maybe bio plausible pile,</v>

7269
03:01:03.430 --> 03:01:03.881
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

7270
03:01:03.881 --> 03:01:04.211
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

7271
03:01:04.211 --> 03:01:04.750
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

7272
03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I know it's frustrating but the philosophy of science,</v>

7273
03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:08.253
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

7274
03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>The cause and effect.</v>

7275
03:01:10.001 --> 03:01:11.680
<v Speaker 2>We do not observe cause and effect.</v>

7276
03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>We do not observe one thing causing another and we just see a and then we see B.</v>

7277
03:01:16.660 --> 03:01:17.140
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

7278
03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:17.561
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

7279
03:01:17.561 --> 03:01:19.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit difficult but imagine this,</v>

7280
03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>we see and we see B,</v>

7281
03:01:21.131 --> 03:01:21.450
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

7282
03:01:21.450 --> 03:01:24.940
<v Speaker 2>we don't see the causal connection cause if we did see the causal connection you</v>

7283
03:01:24.941 --> 03:01:26.350
<v Speaker 2>would know what happens.</v>

7284
03:01:26.351 --> 03:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>When I flipped that coin,</v>

7285
03:01:27.250 --> 03:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>you could have predicted it.</v>

7286
03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You called predict what's going to happen when I file exactly how much force</v>

7287
03:01:31.961 --> 03:01:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you're exerting on your thumb.</v>

7288
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:34.780
<v Speaker 2>To flip that coin,</v>

7289
03:01:34.781 --> 03:01:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I would have to know what altitude we're at to understand what the atmosphere</v>

7290
03:01:38.231 --> 03:01:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that this coin is going through.</v>

7291
03:01:39.850 --> 03:01:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I would have to know the weight of the coin.</v>

7292
03:01:41.231 --> 03:01:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I would have to know that the position of your thumb on the thing,</v>

7293
03:01:44.290 --> 03:01:45.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like what you said about the billiard balls,</v>

7294
03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that it is true that if you could calculate the exact amount of friction on the</v>

7295
03:01:49.901 --> 03:01:51.040
<v Speaker 2>cloth and the table,</v>

7296
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the amount of Polish that are on the balls,</v>

7297
03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:54.220
<v Speaker 2>the amount of force,</v>

7298
03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have all the balls in exactly the same spot,</v>

7299
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:59.463
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

7300
03:01:59.770 --> 03:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>this is not possible today.</v>

7301
03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Today if you set up a table and you set up,</v>

7302
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:09.670
<v Speaker 2>let's say just say nine balls and you told me you were going to know where every</v>

7303
03:02:09.671 --> 03:02:11.560
<v Speaker 2>ball was to the millimeter,</v>

7304
03:02:11.860 --> 03:02:16.860
<v Speaker 2>I would say I will bet you $1 million you're wrong and I would be right every</v>

7305
03:02:17.411 --> 03:02:18.010
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

7306
03:02:18.010 --> 03:02:19.180
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to get it.</v>

7307
03:02:19.450 --> 03:02:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

7308
03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't have the ability to calculate all those very,</v>

7309
03:02:23.051 --> 03:02:24.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's theoretically portion.</v>

7310
03:02:24.430 --> 03:02:25.870
<v Speaker 2>It's also the physical,</v>

7311
03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:30.010
<v Speaker 2>the physical change of the amount of force that you drive when you break those</v>

7312
03:02:30.011 --> 03:02:33.280
<v Speaker 2>balls varies and it varies even slightly.</v>

7313
03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It's going to change the way so a person just doing it with their body is not</v>

7314
03:02:38.621 --> 03:02:40.180
<v Speaker 2>capable of that kind of precision.</v>

7315
03:02:40.210 --> 03:02:41.470
<v Speaker 2>If we got a robot to break,</v>

7316
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:43.690
<v Speaker 2>even if you've got a robot to break,</v>

7317
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you would have to have those balls in exactly the same spot and they don't</v>

7318
03:02:48.521 --> 03:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>usually sit that way because the cloth has fiber in it and it's wool.</v>

7319
03:02:52.781 --> 03:02:57.781
<v Speaker 2>It's a worsted wool and at worst it will moves and shifts and bends and it</v>

7320
03:02:57.881 --> 03:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>flattens out in some spaces and other spaces.</v>

7321
03:03:00.401 --> 03:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It gets dirt and debris.</v>

7322
03:03:01.841 --> 03:03:02.674
<v Speaker 2>In Charleston,</v>

7323
03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:03.580
<v Speaker 2>there's too many variables.</v>

7324
03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>So because we cannot compute all the variables,</v>

7325
03:03:05.531 --> 03:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

7326
03:03:06.010 --> 03:03:06.431
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

7327
03:03:06.431 --> 03:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe we can create a to it with a slight margin of error.</v>

7328
03:03:10.090 --> 03:03:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

7329
03:03:10.530 --> 03:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7330
03:03:10.750 --> 03:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>they'll still be a margin of error.</v>

7331
03:03:12.011 --> 03:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said I need a divine calculator.</v>

7332
03:03:14.830 --> 03:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to even round off the numbers so I'll be slightly wrong.</v>

7333
03:03:18.250 --> 03:03:19.083
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7334
03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>But the argument is that if we had all the variables and that's a big,</v>

7335
03:03:22.391 --> 03:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>if it's logically possible,</v>

7336
03:03:24.311 --> 03:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>it's logically coherent with the reality that we see.</v>

7337
03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7338
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:29.141
<v Speaker 2>Random.</v>

7339
03:03:29.141 --> 03:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>This is by the wayside.</v>

7340
03:03:30.670 --> 03:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a figment of our imagination.</v>

7341
03:03:31.901 --> 03:03:34.720
<v Speaker 2>We projected when we cannot compute,</v>

7342
03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>but if we could,</v>

7343
03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a objective outside of us,</v>

7344
03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7345
03:03:39.550 --> 03:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>The truth is outside of a,</v>

7346
03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not dependent on me and you how we see the world.</v>

7347
03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>So randomness is based essentially on our inability to calculate variables.</v>

7348
03:03:47.471 --> 03:03:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the,</v>

7349
03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:49.490
<v Speaker 2>on an actual law itself.</v>

7350
03:03:50.290 --> 03:03:50.890
<v Speaker 2>When we pray,</v>

7351
03:03:50.890 --> 03:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>when we say that's random,</v>

7352
03:03:51.911 --> 03:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>it's wool,</v>

7353
03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:52.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

7354
03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:54.100
<v Speaker 2>It is and the strictest way of the,</v>

7355
03:03:54.101 --> 03:03:54.491
<v Speaker 2>of the word.</v>

7356
03:03:54.491 --> 03:03:55.324
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

7357
03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:56.580
<v Speaker 2>every logical law.</v>

7358
03:03:56.581 --> 03:03:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Now this,</v>

7359
03:03:56.890 --> 03:03:57.110
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

7360
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:58.040
<v Speaker 2>this is what hurts people,</v>

7361
03:03:58.040 --> 03:03:58.671
<v Speaker 5>but I love science.</v>

7362
03:03:58.671 --> 03:03:58.920
<v Speaker 5>Look at me.</v>

7363
03:03:58.920 --> 03:03:59.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

7364
03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:00.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm a lover of Sinai and I'm a,</v>

7365
03:04:00.431 --> 03:04:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>

7366
03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:01.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm a science addict,</v>

7367
03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:02.061
<v Speaker 5>okay?</v>

7368
03:04:02.061 --> 03:04:02.781
<v Speaker 5>I read all the books.</v>

7369
03:04:02.781 --> 03:04:04.430
<v Speaker 5>I am fascinated by science.</v>

7370
03:04:05.210 --> 03:04:08.380
<v Speaker 5>Let's say I take object x and I throw it at that.</v>

7371
03:04:08.690 --> 03:04:09.680
<v Speaker 5>I throw it at a window.</v>

7372
03:04:09.740 --> 03:04:10.573
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen?</v>

7373
03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:13.760
<v Speaker 5>You don't know or have any experience with object.</v>

7374
03:04:13.970 --> 03:04:14.803
<v Speaker 5>Object.</v>

7375
03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:16.190
<v Speaker 5>Object is why can't you?</v>

7376
03:04:16.220 --> 03:04:17.210
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you deduce it?</v>

7377
03:04:17.450 --> 03:04:18.141
<v Speaker 5>Why can't you do this?</v>

7378
03:04:18.141 --> 03:04:21.200
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen if I had more information than you need experience.</v>

7379
03:04:21.201 --> 03:04:22.790
<v Speaker 5>You need a history with object x.</v>

7380
03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:25.340
<v Speaker 5>You need to get to know object x,</v>

7381
03:04:25.430 --> 03:04:26.263
<v Speaker 5>interact.</v>

7382
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.980
<v Speaker 5>You cannot deduce it.</v>

7383
03:04:28.430 --> 03:04:32.030
<v Speaker 5>While you would write down all these different variables,</v>

7384
03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:35.960
<v Speaker 5>you would find out what people have learned from the past about these variables</v>

7385
03:04:35.961 --> 03:04:37.040
<v Speaker 5>and now we'd be science.</v>

7386
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:38.151
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

7387
03:04:38.151 --> 03:04:41.870
<v Speaker 5>Science is the history of patterns and regularities.</v>

7388
03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:42.680
<v Speaker 5>It is not,</v>

7389
03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:44.660
<v Speaker 5>deduction is not logic.</v>

7390
03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:46.760
<v Speaker 5>It's the type of lighter we call inductive logic.</v>

7391
03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:51.380
<v Speaker 5>This logic is the faith that the past than the future.</v>

7392
03:04:51.430 --> 03:04:52.880
<v Speaker 5>Soon in the future it will behave like the past.</v>

7393
03:04:53.780 --> 03:04:56.210
<v Speaker 5>So the patterns and regularities we see in nature,</v>

7394
03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.291
<v Speaker 5>we say,</v>

7395
03:04:57.291 --> 03:04:57.531
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7396
03:04:57.531 --> 03:04:58.790
<v Speaker 5>if these happen often enough,</v>

7397
03:04:58.791 --> 03:05:00.200
<v Speaker 5>we can recreate these circumstances.</v>

7398
03:05:00.201 --> 03:05:01.034
<v Speaker 5>Often enough,</v>

7399
03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:02.810
<v Speaker 5>we predict it will happen in the future.</v>

7400
03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:05.540
<v Speaker 5>We have a faith that it'll happen again in the future.</v>

7401
03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:07.940
<v Speaker 5>There is no logical reason why it does.</v>

7402
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:11.870
<v Speaker 5>There is no not one single logical reason why we don't fall off the fall off,</v>

7403
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:13.460
<v Speaker 5>fall off the face of the earth.</v>

7404
03:05:13.850 --> 03:05:17.180
<v Speaker 5>Every explanation we give ourselves is just a narrative.</v>

7405
03:05:17.930 --> 03:05:19.940
<v Speaker 5>It is always subject to interpretation.</v>

7406
03:05:20.330 --> 03:05:20.930
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

7407
03:05:20.930 --> 03:05:25.700
<v Speaker 5>with the change in variables like Chyna shifting of the Earth's magnetic poles</v>

7408
03:05:25.701 --> 03:05:28.130
<v Speaker 5>or I gave you a ridiculous narrative,</v>

7409
03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:29.213
<v Speaker 5>the Gremlin one,</v>

7410
03:05:29.540 --> 03:05:30.171
<v Speaker 5>just to show you,</v>

7411
03:05:30.171 --> 03:05:30.380
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7412
03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:31.310
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't believe in mine.</v>

7413
03:05:31.310 --> 03:05:32.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in my neither,</v>

7414
03:05:32.540 --> 03:05:32.691
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

7415
03:05:32.691 --> 03:05:36.830
<v Speaker 5>but I'm doing the same thing Isaac did and I'm going to correlate my Grumman's</v>

7416
03:05:36.831 --> 03:05:40.730
<v Speaker 5>three as far as he can correlate his gravity theory.</v>

7417
03:05:40.731 --> 03:05:41.660
<v Speaker 5>He used the word gravity.</v>

7418
03:05:41.661 --> 03:05:42.380
<v Speaker 5>He made it.</v>

7419
03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:43.520
<v Speaker 5>He made it sound better.</v>

7420
03:05:43.700 --> 03:05:45.110
<v Speaker 5>He made it sound less ridiculous,</v>

7421
03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:47.540
<v Speaker 5>but the truth of matter is he's throwing his hands up in the air and saying,</v>

7422
03:05:47.541 --> 03:05:47.661
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7423
03:05:47.661 --> 03:05:47.960
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

7424
03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:48.890
<v Speaker 5>let's just call it gravity.</v>

7425
03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:49.731
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

7426
03:05:49.731 --> 03:05:50.780
<v Speaker 5>this is the way to think about it.</v>

7427
03:05:51.050 --> 03:05:51.231
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

7428
03:05:51.231 --> 03:05:52.520
<v Speaker 5>His contemporaries laughed at him.</v>

7429
03:05:52.521 --> 03:05:52.731
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

7430
03:05:52.731 --> 03:05:53.780
<v Speaker 5>it's an appeal to magic,</v>

7431
03:05:54.380 --> 03:05:56.570
<v Speaker 5>and then when people started wearing those shades,</v>

7432
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:57.351
<v Speaker 5>those paradigms,</v>

7433
03:05:57.351 --> 03:05:57.561
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

7434
03:05:57.561 --> 03:05:57.771
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

7435
03:05:57.771 --> 03:05:58.760
<v Speaker 5>it makes sense if you,</v>

7436
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:59.481
<v Speaker 5>if you believe,</v>

7437
03:05:59.481 --> 03:05:59.840
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

7438
03:05:59.840 --> 03:06:01.520
<v Speaker 5>if you just believe in gravity for a second,</v>

7439
03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:03.970
<v Speaker 5>it explains all this ballet of,</v>

7440
03:06:03.971 --> 03:06:06.740
<v Speaker 5>of celestial bodies and how they move,</v>

7441
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:10.610
<v Speaker 5>but really what he discovered was a pattern and he gave that pattern in name,</v>

7442
03:06:11.390 --> 03:06:13.040
<v Speaker 5>but does that force exists out there?</v>

7443
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.881
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7444
03:06:13.881 --> 03:06:14.691
<v Speaker 5>not according to Einstein.</v>

7445
03:06:14.691 --> 03:06:17.910
<v Speaker 5>He came up with a different narrative that fits the evidence even better than</v>

7446
03:06:17.911 --> 03:06:18.810
<v Speaker 5>than Isaac Newton did.</v>

7447
03:06:19.220 --> 03:06:20.360
<v Speaker 5>But it's still a narrative.</v>

7448
03:06:20.361 --> 03:06:20.540
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

7449
03:06:20.540 --> 03:06:23.690
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't removed all the other possibilities for something to be true.</v>

7450
03:06:24.020 --> 03:06:24.771
<v Speaker 5>Without a doubt.</v>

7451
03:06:24.771 --> 03:06:25.760
<v Speaker 5>For it to be knowledge,</v>

7452
03:06:26.300 --> 03:06:27.133
<v Speaker 5>not belief.</v>

7453
03:06:27.380 --> 03:06:28.610
<v Speaker 5>There has to be zeroed out,</v>

7454
03:06:28.640 --> 03:06:30.680
<v Speaker 5>meaning no other possibility whatsoever.</v>

7455
03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:31.693
<v Speaker 5>That's knowledge.</v>

7456
03:06:31.790 --> 03:06:32.200
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>

7457
03:06:32.200 --> 03:06:34.070
<v Speaker 5>so can you know something that's untrue?</v>

7458
03:06:34.580 --> 03:06:35.860
<v Speaker 5>You cannot know something that's untrue.</v>

7459
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:38.180
<v Speaker 5>You could believe something that's untrue.</v>

7460
03:06:38.390 --> 03:06:41.120
<v Speaker 5>Knowledge means that this is known.</v>

7461
03:06:41.121 --> 03:06:42.470
<v Speaker 5>There is no possibility of doubt.</v>

7462
03:06:42.471 --> 03:06:45.680
<v Speaker 5>That's why Descartes was such an important philosopher because he gave us one</v>

7463
03:06:45.681 --> 03:06:48.310
<v Speaker 5>thing that we know the cogito.</v>

7464
03:06:48.320 --> 03:06:49.190
<v Speaker 5>Have you heard of the Cogito?</v>

7465
03:06:49.970 --> 03:06:51.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what it is.</v>

7466
03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:52.430
<v Speaker 5>I think therefore I am.</v>

7467
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:53.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

7468
03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:54.093
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

7469
03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:56.550
<v Speaker 5>What is it that we know for sure cause cause uh,</v>

7470
03:06:57.270 --> 03:06:57.811
<v Speaker 5>you know it's funny,</v>

7471
03:06:57.811 --> 03:07:00.390
<v Speaker 5>there's two great philosophies that I've read that they went through a crisis in</v>

7472
03:07:00.391 --> 03:07:00.720
<v Speaker 5>their life.</v>

7473
03:07:00.720 --> 03:07:03.810
<v Speaker 5>One of them was MMO has Elliot agreed Arabic philosopher and one of them was</v>

7474
03:07:03.811 --> 03:07:07.080
<v Speaker 5>only they kept and both their writings are very like they're,</v>

7475
03:07:07.170 --> 03:07:07.830
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

7476
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:08.011
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

7477
03:07:08.011 --> 03:07:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Because they go through this crisis,</v>

7478
03:07:09.151 --> 03:07:09.960
<v Speaker 5>they go through,</v>

7479
03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:10.950
<v Speaker 5>what do I actually know?</v>

7480
03:07:10.951 --> 03:07:11.431
<v Speaker 5>What's not?</v>

7481
03:07:11.431 --> 03:07:14.400
<v Speaker 5>Because they came to this exact same conclusion that hey,</v>

7482
03:07:14.401 --> 03:07:17.130
<v Speaker 5>it's all song and it's all as explanation.</v>

7483
03:07:17.131 --> 03:07:17.964
<v Speaker 5>It's not proof.</v>

7484
03:07:19.080 --> 03:07:19.980
<v Speaker 5>It's all a narrative.</v>

7485
03:07:19.981 --> 03:07:20.880
<v Speaker 5>It's all a point of view.</v>

7486
03:07:21.180 --> 03:07:23.910
<v Speaker 5>Science keeps getting refined and changed.</v>

7487
03:07:23.911 --> 03:07:24.780
<v Speaker 5>What we more information,</v>

7488
03:07:24.781 --> 03:07:27.240
<v Speaker 5>what we believed yesterday gets taken out from underneath us.</v>

7489
03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:31.230
<v Speaker 5>Today's paradigms going to be shifted again a hundred years from now,</v>

7490
03:07:31.230 --> 03:07:31.680
<v Speaker 5>a thousand years from now.</v>

7491
03:07:31.680 --> 03:07:33.030
<v Speaker 5>What can I grab and be like,</v>

7492
03:07:33.031 --> 03:07:33.661
<v Speaker 5>this is true.</v>

7493
03:07:33.661 --> 03:07:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Nobody can ever take this from me.</v>

7494
03:07:35.610 --> 03:07:36.930
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be called knowledge.</v>

7495
03:07:37.350 --> 03:07:38.960
<v Speaker 5>So it all comes down like at the end,</v>

7496
03:07:38.970 --> 03:07:41.420
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the long journey of Cartesian doubt,</v>

7497
03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:41.971
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

7498
03:07:41.971 --> 03:07:45.030
<v Speaker 5>it was so extreme that the philosophers give it a new name.</v>

7499
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:46.020
<v Speaker 5>They call it Cartesian dot.</v>

7500
03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:47.160
<v Speaker 5>They call it modern philosophy.</v>

7501
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:49.890
<v Speaker 5>So philosophy is thousands of years old.</v>

7502
03:07:50.160 --> 03:07:50.821
<v Speaker 5>Descartes comes,</v>

7503
03:07:50.821 --> 03:07:51.331
<v Speaker 5>writes a book,</v>

7504
03:07:51.331 --> 03:07:54.690
<v Speaker 5>he wrote six chapters in six days and he was like,</v>

7505
03:07:54.691 --> 03:07:55.770
<v Speaker 5>what do I actually know?</v>

7506
03:07:55.771 --> 03:07:57.420
<v Speaker 5>100% without a doubt,</v>

7507
03:07:57.421 --> 03:07:58.440
<v Speaker 5>nobody could ever question me.</v>

7508
03:07:59.370 --> 03:07:59.701
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

7509
03:07:59.701 --> 03:07:59.821
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7510
03:07:59.821 --> 03:08:00.660
<v Speaker 5>I believe in the Cognito.</v>

7511
03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:01.381
<v Speaker 5>What's the Kogi too?</v>

7512
03:08:01.381 --> 03:08:02.430
<v Speaker 5>I think therefore I am.</v>

7513
03:08:03.180 --> 03:08:04.680
<v Speaker 5>So he goes through a long process.</v>

7514
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:05.011
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

7515
03:08:05.011 --> 03:08:05.641
<v Speaker 5>if we have the time,</v>

7516
03:08:05.641 --> 03:08:05.801
<v Speaker 5>we'll,</v>

7517
03:08:05.801 --> 03:08:06.241
<v Speaker 5>we'll go through.</v>

7518
03:08:06.241 --> 03:08:08.610
<v Speaker 5>A little nutshell of it says,</v>

7519
03:08:08.611 --> 03:08:09.630
<v Speaker 5>look is look,</v>

7520
03:08:09.631 --> 03:08:09.841
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>

7521
03:08:09.841 --> 03:08:11.430
<v Speaker 5>when I put a straw in a glass of water,</v>

7522
03:08:12.330 --> 03:08:14.070
<v Speaker 5>my eyes tell me that the straw is bent,</v>

7523
03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:16.141
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7524
03:08:16.141 --> 03:08:18.420
<v Speaker 5>Cause the reflection of the waters is bent.</v>

7525
03:08:18.421 --> 03:08:18.720
<v Speaker 5>The light,</v>

7526
03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:21.210
<v Speaker 5>the reflection of the light off the water is bent.</v>

7527
03:08:21.220 --> 03:08:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7528
03:08:21.870 --> 03:08:22.141
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

7529
03:08:22.141 --> 03:08:22.261
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7530
03:08:22.261 --> 03:08:23.094
<v Speaker 5>my eyes light to me.</v>

7531
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Aristotle thought the sun goes around the earth,</v>

7532
03:08:25.530 --> 03:08:26.490
<v Speaker 5>his eyes light to him.</v>

7533
03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:27.960
<v Speaker 5>Our senses lie.</v>

7534
03:08:28.410 --> 03:08:30.270
<v Speaker 5>And he talks about if I put my hand in cold water,</v>

7535
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:32.130
<v Speaker 5>then I put it in tepid water.</v>

7536
03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:33.210
<v Speaker 5>They'll seem warm to me.</v>

7537
03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:35.310
<v Speaker 5>But that's just my bias.</v>

7538
03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:38.330
<v Speaker 5>My inability to tell you what my,</v>

7539
03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:39.030
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

7540
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:41.580
<v Speaker 5>my instruments are not accurate enough.</v>

7541
03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:43.621
<v Speaker 5>So he said,</v>

7542
03:08:43.621 --> 03:08:43.831
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

7543
03:08:43.831 --> 03:08:44.161
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

7544
03:08:44.161 --> 03:08:45.300
<v Speaker 5>let's put the</v>

7545
03:08:47.610 --> 03:08:49.850
<v Speaker 5>empiricism or senses by the wayside.</v>

7546
03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:50.910
<v Speaker 5>CanNot give us truth.</v>

7547
03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:52.753
<v Speaker 5>Can I give us truth?</v>

7548
03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:53.341
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

7549
03:08:53.341 --> 03:08:54.091
<v Speaker 5>what about deduction?</v>

7550
03:08:54.091 --> 03:08:54.924
<v Speaker 5>What about math?</v>

7551
03:08:55.140 --> 03:08:56.130
<v Speaker 5>And the local knowledge,</v>

7552
03:08:56.340 --> 03:08:57.420
<v Speaker 5>one plus one equals two.</v>

7553
03:08:58.260 --> 03:08:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Believe it or not,</v>

7554
03:08:58.950 --> 03:09:01.650
<v Speaker 5>philosophers also disagree with a lot of mathematical,</v>

7555
03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:02.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

7556
03:09:02.580 --> 03:09:03.360
<v Speaker 5>beliefs.</v>

7557
03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:04.081
<v Speaker 5>So for instance,</v>

7558
03:09:04.081 --> 03:09:04.351
<v Speaker 5>here's a,</v>

7559
03:09:04.351 --> 03:09:05.550
<v Speaker 5>here's a big critique of math.</v>

7560
03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:06.413
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

7561
03:09:07.140 --> 03:09:08.280
<v Speaker 5>One plus one equals two.</v>

7562
03:09:08.281 --> 03:09:09.114
<v Speaker 5>We all believe it.</v>

7563
03:09:10.320 --> 03:09:14.430
<v Speaker 5>But the critique is that one plus one is another way of saying too,</v>

7564
03:09:14.610 --> 03:09:16.620
<v Speaker 5>there's no actual information you ever gave me.</v>

7565
03:09:18.630 --> 03:09:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Mathematics is just one way to sum up a lot of information.</v>

7566
03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:24.330
<v Speaker 5>It helps me give you an epiphany.</v>

7567
03:09:24.450 --> 03:09:24.710
<v Speaker 5>It makes,</v>

7568
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:25.530
<v Speaker 5>it makes me,</v>

7569
03:09:25.530 --> 03:09:28.080
<v Speaker 5>it helps me make you understand what's happening on the billiard ball table.</v>

7570
03:09:28.370 --> 03:09:29.310
<v Speaker 5>We'll give you a calling,</v>

7571
03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:31.110
<v Speaker 5>one plus one two.</v>

7572
03:09:31.350 --> 03:09:34.010
<v Speaker 5>You're not changing the objects themselves in.</v>

7573
03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:36.810
<v Speaker 5>It's always been two things always been too.</v>

7574
03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:37.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7575
03:09:37.710 --> 03:09:38.491
<v Speaker 5>it's a tautology.</v>

7576
03:09:38.491 --> 03:09:41.820
<v Speaker 5>You're just explaining to me something that's out there already existing.</v>

7577
03:09:42.390 --> 03:09:44.130
<v Speaker 5>So if I tell you a triangle has three points,</v>

7578
03:09:44.131 --> 03:09:45.510
<v Speaker 5>why when I said the word triangle,</v>

7579
03:09:46.110 --> 03:09:47.200
<v Speaker 5>I already told you how three points,</v>

7580
03:09:47.201 --> 03:09:48.630
<v Speaker 5>but maybe you didn't pick that up.</v>

7581
03:09:48.660 --> 03:09:49.770
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you had to point that out to you.</v>

7582
03:09:50.460 --> 03:09:52.850
<v Speaker 5>So Bertrand Russell said it beautifully,</v>

7583
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:55.240
<v Speaker 5>said look first in his career,</v>

7584
03:09:55.390 --> 03:09:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Burton Russel is a very,</v>

7585
03:09:56.710 --> 03:09:57.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

7586
03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:57.700
<v Speaker 5>he's a great thinker.</v>

7587
03:09:57.700 --> 03:09:57.971
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

7588
03:09:57.971 --> 03:09:58.570
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7589
03:09:58.570 --> 03:10:00.190
<v Speaker 5>mathematics is the thing we're more sure of.</v>

7590
03:10:00.370 --> 03:10:01.480
<v Speaker 5>By the end of his career,</v>

7591
03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:02.373
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>

7592
03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:02.681
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

7593
03:10:02.681 --> 03:10:03.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even sure about math anymore.</v>

7594
03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:04.211
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

7595
03:10:04.211 --> 03:10:04.780
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

7596
03:10:04.780 --> 03:10:08.440
<v Speaker 5>I think math is just another way of seeing a four legged animal has is an</v>

7597
03:10:08.441 --> 03:10:09.274
<v Speaker 5>animal,</v>

7598
03:10:09.310 --> 03:10:11.530
<v Speaker 5>but you said that when you said it's four legged animal,</v>

7599
03:10:12.310 --> 03:10:14.710
<v Speaker 5>and he just repeated yourself by saying it's an animal.</v>

7600
03:10:15.040 --> 03:10:16.720
<v Speaker 5>If I say there's my wife,</v>

7601
03:10:16.721 --> 03:10:19.090
<v Speaker 5>I married her when I said my wife,</v>

7602
03:10:19.091 --> 03:10:19.924
<v Speaker 5>I told you I married her.</v>

7603
03:10:19.930 --> 03:10:20.860
<v Speaker 5>That's what math is doing.</v>

7604
03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:22.990
<v Speaker 5>Math is giving you the information again,</v>

7605
03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:25.870
<v Speaker 5>in a simpler form that you can understand and you think,</v>

7606
03:10:25.871 --> 03:10:25.991
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

7607
03:10:25.991 --> 03:10:27.010
<v Speaker 5>I've deduced this instrument.</v>

7608
03:10:27.011 --> 03:10:27.101
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7609
03:10:27.101 --> 03:10:28.750
<v Speaker 5>actually the information was there in the question,</v>

7610
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:30.783
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7611
03:10:31.330 --> 03:10:31.750
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>

7612
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:33.100
<v Speaker 5>some philosophers disagree with this.</v>

7613
03:10:33.101 --> 03:10:33.311
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

7614
03:10:33.311 --> 03:10:33.481
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

7615
03:10:33.481 --> 03:10:34.570
<v Speaker 5>a math brings you like can't,</v>

7616
03:10:34.571 --> 03:10:35.141
<v Speaker 5>can't said no.</v>

7617
03:10:35.141 --> 03:10:36.610
<v Speaker 5>Math tells you something.</v>

7618
03:10:36.670 --> 03:10:37.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

7619
03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:38.080
<v Speaker 5>let's put that on the waste side.</v>

7620
03:10:38.081 --> 03:10:38.950
<v Speaker 5>Here's another critique.</v>

7621
03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:42.760
<v Speaker 5>One I've personally could never get around is say,</v>

7622
03:10:42.761 --> 03:10:42.971
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

7623
03:10:42.971 --> 03:10:43.271
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

7624
03:10:43.271 --> 03:10:43.990
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7625
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:45.490
<v Speaker 5>all of the greatest thinkers in history,</v>

7626
03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:48.010
<v Speaker 5>there's actually an urban Timia critique of logic.</v>

7627
03:10:48.010 --> 03:10:48.221
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

7628
03:10:48.221 --> 03:10:48.371
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7629
03:10:48.371 --> 03:10:51.970
<v Speaker 5>all the greatest thinkers in history all disagree like Plato and Aristotle.</v>

7630
03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:53.770
<v Speaker 5>Plato tutored Aristotle,</v>

7631
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:57.400
<v Speaker 5>two of the greatest thinkers in ancient history.</v>

7632
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:59.140
<v Speaker 5>They don't agree with one another.</v>

7633
03:10:59.980 --> 03:11:00.510
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

7634
03:11:00.510 --> 03:11:02.060
<v Speaker 5>They both think they will say you're wrong.</v>

7635
03:11:02.061 --> 03:11:02.531
<v Speaker 5>And then like I said,</v>

7636
03:11:02.531 --> 03:11:03.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm on.</v>

7637
03:11:03.010 --> 03:11:03.843
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

7638
03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:04.953
<v Speaker 5>fast forward.</v>

7639
03:11:05.410 --> 03:11:06.430
<v Speaker 5>Every generation,</v>

7640
03:11:06.431 --> 03:11:07.720
<v Speaker 5>their greatest thinkers disagreed.</v>

7641
03:11:08.320 --> 03:11:10.600
<v Speaker 5>Lightness didn't agree with Voltaire Today,</v>

7642
03:11:10.601 --> 03:11:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Sam Harris and and Jordan Peterson to,</v>

7643
03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:13.811
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

7644
03:11:13.811 --> 03:11:17.110
<v Speaker 5>maybe they're not the top topic lectures of our war of our on Earth Day,</v>

7645
03:11:17.111 --> 03:11:17.930
<v Speaker 5>but there are there among the,</v>

7646
03:11:17.930 --> 03:11:18.763
<v Speaker 5>among the elite.</v>

7647
03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:21.520
<v Speaker 5>They don't agree on what is true.</v>

7648
03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:23.140
<v Speaker 5>When you ask them what's truth,</v>

7649
03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:24.370
<v Speaker 5>you guys are talking about truth all day long.</v>

7650
03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Can you define it for us?</v>

7651
03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:26.733
<v Speaker 5>We don't agree.</v>

7652
03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:30.970
<v Speaker 5>So if logic is something that tells us about the world,</v>

7653
03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:31.720
<v Speaker 5>if it is,</v>

7654
03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:33.910
<v Speaker 5>let's say we grant that they card saying,</v>

7655
03:11:33.911 --> 03:11:34.744
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7656
03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:35.640
<v Speaker 5>we can't use it.</v>

7657
03:11:35.641 --> 03:11:36.050
<v Speaker 5>We don't.</v>

7658
03:11:36.050 --> 03:11:40.150
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's good enough to use it and get to a conclusion that everybody agrees</v>

7659
03:11:40.151 --> 03:11:40.984
<v Speaker 5>upon.</v>

7660
03:11:41.530 --> 03:11:41.951
<v Speaker 5>So he's saying,</v>

7661
03:11:41.951 --> 03:11:42.190
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7662
03:11:42.190 --> 03:11:43.150
<v Speaker 5>even that doesn't help me.</v>

7663
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:45.970
<v Speaker 5>So he came up to the Cogito,</v>

7664
03:11:45.971 --> 03:11:46.804
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

7665
03:11:47.020 --> 03:11:47.853
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

7666
03:11:48.670 --> 03:11:49.640
<v Speaker 5>he doubted everything.</v>

7667
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Like even went to the point where he said,</v>

7668
03:11:51.520 --> 03:11:52.420
<v Speaker 5>what if I'm dreaming?</v>

7669
03:11:54.250 --> 03:11:56.810
<v Speaker 5>What if there's a evil demon or they're always tricky?</v>

7670
03:11:56.811 --> 03:11:56.941
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

7671
03:11:56.941 --> 03:11:58.330
<v Speaker 5>he went really out there like he,</v>

7672
03:11:58.370 --> 03:12:03.040
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the reasons why simulation theory is to what people really do,</v>

7673
03:12:04.250 --> 03:12:09.130
<v Speaker 5>what series people consider the potential that not only is it possible that we</v>

7674
03:12:09.131 --> 03:12:10.090
<v Speaker 5>are in a simulation,</v>

7675
03:12:10.091 --> 03:12:10.990
<v Speaker 5>but that there are many,</v>

7676
03:12:10.991 --> 03:12:15.640
<v Speaker 5>many simulations inside of simulations because we couldn't.</v>

7677
03:12:15.641 --> 03:12:19.080
<v Speaker 5>That's what the egocentric predicament we were talking about earlier is you can</v>

7678
03:12:19.081 --> 03:12:21.250
<v Speaker 5>not experience anything outside of your consciousness,</v>

7679
03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:25.000
<v Speaker 5>so you could be plugged into a machine right now and this is just a big old</v>

7680
03:12:25.001 --> 03:12:26.020
<v Speaker 5>dream could be,</v>

7681
03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:28.990
<v Speaker 5>and that's why Descartes wanted to know what would be true.</v>

7682
03:12:28.991 --> 03:12:31.900
<v Speaker 5>Even if I was in a simulator and that's I think therefore I am,</v>

7683
03:12:31.901 --> 03:12:33.700
<v Speaker 5>therefore I am because for me to have thoughts,</v>

7684
03:12:34.090 --> 03:12:35.050
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to exist.</v>

7685
03:12:35.650 --> 03:12:39.160
<v Speaker 5>If you doubt the Kogi till you've proved the Cognito gets to object to it,</v>

7686
03:12:39.161 --> 03:12:41.150
<v Speaker 5>you first have to have existence Bryant,</v>

7687
03:12:41.370 --> 03:12:42.203
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7688
03:12:42.430 --> 03:12:43.240
<v Speaker 5>He refined it,</v>

7689
03:12:43.240 --> 03:12:43.541
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

7690
03:12:43.541 --> 03:12:45.820
<v Speaker 5>I think thinkers refined that later on and before him.</v>

7691
03:12:45.821 --> 03:12:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Also many thinkers came to this conclusion.</v>

7692
03:12:47.291 --> 03:12:48.520
<v Speaker 5>He just did it really famously.</v>

7693
03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:49.271
<v Speaker 5>He did it.</v>

7694
03:12:49.271 --> 03:12:51.470
<v Speaker 5>We did it in one sentence too.</v>

7695
03:12:51.860 --> 03:12:52.760
<v Speaker 5>He did it in one sentence.</v>

7696
03:12:52.761 --> 03:12:53.594
<v Speaker 5>He summed it up.</v>

7697
03:12:53.900 --> 03:12:55.180
<v Speaker 5>That's why if you,</v>

7698
03:12:55.350 --> 03:12:55.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7699
03:12:55.580 --> 03:12:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of Ockham's razor.</v>

7700
03:12:57.080 --> 03:12:59.100
<v Speaker 5>If you use Ockham's razor to an extra,</v>

7701
03:12:59.101 --> 03:12:59.631
<v Speaker 5>if you go create,</v>

7702
03:12:59.631 --> 03:13:02.120
<v Speaker 5>if you go to an extreme degree,</v>

7703
03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:04.790
<v Speaker 5>if you everything with adult,</v>

7704
03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:05.633
<v Speaker 5>you chop it,</v>

7705
03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:08.930
<v Speaker 5>everything did might be imaginary,</v>

7706
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:10.423
<v Speaker 5>inferred,</v>

7707
03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:11.151
<v Speaker 5>logical,</v>

7708
03:13:11.151 --> 03:13:11.720
<v Speaker 5>empirical.</v>

7709
03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:12.553
<v Speaker 5>You Chop it.</v>

7710
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:13.663
<v Speaker 5>What happens?</v>

7711
03:13:13.820 --> 03:13:15.350
<v Speaker 5>You have a transcendent experience.</v>

7712
03:13:15.351 --> 03:13:17.930
<v Speaker 5>You'd become you if you take off all your paradigms,</v>

7713
03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:20.720
<v Speaker 5>and this takes a very brave human being to do,</v>

7714
03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.220
<v Speaker 5>to remove everything that anybody's ever told you and have the experience of the</v>

7715
03:13:25.221 --> 03:13:26.054
<v Speaker 5>one thing,</v>

7716
03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:27.320
<v Speaker 5>what you would know,</v>

7717
03:13:27.321 --> 03:13:29.240
<v Speaker 5>what you would come to with with mystics.</v>

7718
03:13:29.270 --> 03:13:30.530
<v Speaker 5>That's why I believe that there's,</v>

7719
03:13:30.531 --> 03:13:35.000
<v Speaker 5>there's a place where you can get where religion is true and science has faith</v>

7720
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:36.500
<v Speaker 5>and I know it sounds crazy,</v>

7721
03:13:36.501 --> 03:13:38.360
<v Speaker 5>but there is a point and I believe in science,</v>

7722
03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:38.871
<v Speaker 5>don't get me wrong,</v>

7723
03:13:38.871 --> 03:13:39.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>

7724
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I can't pray science enough,</v>

7725
03:13:41.570 --> 03:13:44.740
<v Speaker 5>but there is a transcendent experience a human has and that transcendent</v>

7726
03:13:44.741 --> 03:13:47.990
<v Speaker 5>experience is consciousness itself,</v>

7727
03:13:47.991 --> 03:13:49.400
<v Speaker 5>not the content of consciousness.</v>

7728
03:13:49.430 --> 03:13:50.720
<v Speaker 5>This is where people make a mistake.</v>

7729
03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:53.210
<v Speaker 5>Consciousness itself,</v>

7730
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:54.321
<v Speaker 5>reality.</v>

7731
03:13:54.321 --> 03:13:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Your world is nested in consciousness.</v>

7732
03:13:56.090 --> 03:13:58.340
<v Speaker 5>People think conscious is within my brain.</v>

7733
03:13:58.341 --> 03:13:59.174
<v Speaker 5>It's the opposite.</v>

7734
03:13:59.390 --> 03:13:59.961
<v Speaker 5>Your brain,</v>

7735
03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:00.441
<v Speaker 5>your body,</v>

7736
03:14:00.441 --> 03:14:00.740
<v Speaker 5>your uh,</v>

7737
03:14:00.740 --> 03:14:01.041
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

7738
03:14:01.041 --> 03:14:02.450
<v Speaker 5>your self is in consciousness.</v>

7739
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:03.380
<v Speaker 5>And when we,</v>

7740
03:14:03.380 --> 03:14:04.400
<v Speaker 5>when we get to this point,</v>

7741
03:14:04.401 --> 03:14:05.900
<v Speaker 5>then all our paradox is disappear.</v>

7742
03:14:05.901 --> 03:14:06.740
<v Speaker 5>There's no more paradox.</v>

7743
03:14:06.750 --> 03:14:08.230
<v Speaker 5>The logical paradox is movement.</v>

7744
03:14:08.570 --> 03:14:09.231
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if we have time,</v>

7745
03:14:09.231 --> 03:14:10.490
<v Speaker 5>we talked biological paradoxes.</v>

7746
03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:11.473
<v Speaker 5>They never end.</v>

7747
03:14:11.810 --> 03:14:12.291
<v Speaker 5>But when we,</v>

7748
03:14:12.291 --> 03:14:15.590
<v Speaker 5>we understand that our world is nested in consciousness,</v>

7749
03:14:15.650 --> 03:14:18.380
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing happening in the world around you that's outside of your</v>

7750
03:14:18.381 --> 03:14:19.214
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>

7751
03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:20.840
<v Speaker 5>It's only outside of your eagle.</v>

7752
03:14:21.050 --> 03:14:23.480
<v Speaker 5>The thing you would you associate with Joe Rogan</v>

7753
03:14:26.240 --> 03:14:28.010
<v Speaker 5>is also happening inside your consciousness.</v>

7754
03:14:28.011 --> 03:14:29.660
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is within consciousness.</v>

7755
03:14:29.810 --> 03:14:32.720
<v Speaker 5>No Brene has ever been observed outside of consciousness.</v>

7756
03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:35.750
<v Speaker 5>See and flow in materialism.</v>

7757
03:14:35.751 --> 03:14:36.260
<v Speaker 5>We have this,</v>

7758
03:14:36.260 --> 03:14:41.260
<v Speaker 5>they have this philosophy called Epi for nominalism that the consciousness is a</v>

7759
03:14:41.601 --> 03:14:43.220
<v Speaker 5>byproduct of this physical brain.</v>

7760
03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:49.720
<v Speaker 5>We have this physical brain and your consciousness is like a byproducts,</v>

7761
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.983
<v Speaker 5>like a smoke.</v>

7762
03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:52.641
<v Speaker 5>Now we asked them,</v>

7763
03:14:52.641 --> 03:14:54.590
<v Speaker 5>how do you know about this physical brain?</v>

7764
03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:56.810
<v Speaker 5>All we know it because of our consciousness.</v>

7765
03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:59.930
<v Speaker 5>So if your consciousness is fake,</v>

7766
03:14:59.931 --> 03:15:00.764
<v Speaker 5>unreal,</v>

7767
03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:01.310
<v Speaker 5>then souls,</v>

7768
03:15:01.310 --> 03:15:01.791
<v Speaker 5>your brain,</v>

7769
03:15:01.791 --> 03:15:02.670
<v Speaker 5>your brain's x.</v>

7770
03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:05.780
<v Speaker 5>The reason why we all know about brains is because of conscious consciousness</v>

7771
03:15:05.781 --> 03:15:06.920
<v Speaker 5>tells us about brains.</v>

7772
03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:09.650
<v Speaker 5>So brains are dependent on consciousness,</v>

7773
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:11.930
<v Speaker 5>not consciousness dependent on the brain.</v>

7774
03:15:12.770 --> 03:15:14.210
<v Speaker 5>So I know this is a bit of a tricky thing,</v>

7775
03:15:14.211 --> 03:15:15.860
<v Speaker 5>but this is what idealism is all about.</v>

7776
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:21.500
<v Speaker 5>There is no physical object outside of consciousness.</v>

7777
03:15:21.501 --> 03:15:23.000
<v Speaker 5>It's all mental construct.</v>

7778
03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:23.990
<v Speaker 5>This is d,</v>

7779
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.471
<v Speaker 5>this is what we,</v>

7780
03:15:24.471 --> 03:15:25.040
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>

7781
03:15:25.040 --> 03:15:28.730
<v Speaker 5>we started this podcast talking about it and we ended on a mind.</v>

7782
03:15:28.731 --> 03:15:29.130
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

7783
03:15:29.130 --> 03:15:29.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7784
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:30.140
<v Speaker 5>seriously.</v>

7785
03:15:30.140 --> 03:15:31.160
<v Speaker 5>This is a serious mind.</v>

7786
03:15:31.161 --> 03:15:32.750
<v Speaker 5>Fuck the egocentric predicament.</v>

7787
03:15:32.751 --> 03:15:33.770
<v Speaker 5>Not In an not an easy one.</v>

7788
03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:34.131
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

7789
03:15:34.131 --> 03:15:34.970
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>

7790
03:15:35.710 --> 03:15:36.543
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

7791
03:15:36.940 --> 03:15:41.360
<v Speaker 5>it's a fascinating yet impractical exercise because you will,</v>

7792
03:15:41.361 --> 03:15:45.260
<v Speaker 5>you will do it to the end of the time we'd be sitting here debating and</v>

7793
03:15:45.261 --> 03:15:48.230
<v Speaker 5>discussing and dissecting the very,</v>

7794
03:15:48.231 --> 03:15:48.771
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

7795
03:15:48.771 --> 03:15:50.280
<v Speaker 5>that's also how you gain a greater</v>

7796
03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:53.040
<v Speaker 2>and deeper understanding of all the things you have no idea what the fuck they</v>

7797
03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:53.350
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

7798
03:15:53.350 --> 03:15:54.183
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

7799
03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:56.081
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

7800
03:15:56.081 --> 03:15:56.914
<v Speaker 5>it's still,</v>

7801
03:15:57.280 --> 03:15:59.200
<v Speaker 5>it's still amazing to me.</v>

7802
03:15:59.201 --> 03:16:00.034
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

7803
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:05.710
<v Speaker 5>how much is to be explored about what is real around this,</v>

7804
03:16:05.991 --> 03:16:06.824
<v Speaker 5>like the world,</v>

7805
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:10.000
<v Speaker 5>the reality of the world around us is it's,</v>

7806
03:16:10.170 --> 03:16:10.520
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

7807
03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:12.440
<v Speaker 5>it's greater than any mystery in existence.</v>

7808
03:16:12.441 --> 03:16:12.921
<v Speaker 5>That's why for me,</v>

7809
03:16:12.921 --> 03:16:13.910
<v Speaker 5>I can't read fiction.</v>

7810
03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:15.770
<v Speaker 5>I only study science,</v>

7811
03:16:15.771 --> 03:16:16.071
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

7812
03:16:16.071 --> 03:16:16.431
<v Speaker 5>philosophy.</v>

7813
03:16:16.431 --> 03:16:17.264
<v Speaker 5>That's the only thing.</v>

7814
03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:17.691
<v Speaker 5>Science,</v>

7815
03:16:17.691 --> 03:16:17.931
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

7816
03:16:17.931 --> 03:16:18.291
<v Speaker 5>philosophy,</v>

7817
03:16:18.291 --> 03:16:18.830
<v Speaker 5>religion.</v>

7818
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's weird enough.</v>

7819
03:16:20.660 --> 03:16:20.871
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

7820
03:16:20.871 --> 03:16:21.840
<v Speaker 5>because it,</v>

7821
03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:27.020
<v Speaker 5>they're all trying to tell me they all trying to explain the world around us and</v>

7822
03:16:27.021 --> 03:16:28.130
<v Speaker 5>it's such a hard thing to do.</v>

7823
03:16:28.131 --> 03:16:29.000
<v Speaker 5>To sum up what's,</v>

7824
03:16:29.010 --> 03:16:29.843
<v Speaker 5>what's reality.</v>

7825
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.410
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

7826
03:16:30.410 --> 03:16:32.570
<v Speaker 5>all these philosophies and theories are trying to sum it up.</v>

7827
03:16:32.780 --> 03:16:33.613
<v Speaker 5>This is reality.</v>

7828
03:16:34.250 --> 03:16:37.160
<v Speaker 5>And to cross examine them for me is far more entertaining than watching a movie</v>

7829
03:16:37.161 --> 03:16:38.600
<v Speaker 5>or hearing a fictional story.</v>

7830
03:16:39.890 --> 03:16:40.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7831
03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:40.431
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7832
03:16:40.431 --> 03:16:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

7833
03:16:41.210 --> 03:16:41.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7834
03:16:41.631 --> 03:16:44.560
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely fascinating and entertaining and uh,</v>

7835
03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

7836
03:16:44.850 --> 03:16:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I like fictional stories too though.</v>

7837
03:16:46.910 --> 03:16:47.271
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

7838
03:16:47.271 --> 03:16:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I like observing creativity because I'm fascinated by the human experience and</v>

7839
03:16:51.891 --> 03:16:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinating by what people were able to</v>

7840
03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:56.100
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

7841
03:16:56.100 --> 03:16:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Create out of their own mind.</v>

7842
03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Something like we were talking yesterday about Stephen King about how amazing it</v>

7843
03:17:02.131 --> 03:17:07.131
<v Speaker 2>is that this guy just keeps continuing to create these bizarre stories and that</v>

7844
03:17:07.501 --> 03:17:08.311
<v Speaker 2>someone can do that.</v>

7845
03:17:08.311 --> 03:17:13.311
<v Speaker 2>The your consciousness and by putting so much emphasis on creativity and your</v>

7846
03:17:13.711 --> 03:17:18.711
<v Speaker 2>ability to just write down things that never really happened and paint a picture</v>

7847
03:17:18.841 --> 03:17:19.950
<v Speaker 2>inside someone's mind.</v>

7848
03:17:20.310 --> 03:17:20.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7849
03:17:20.491 --> 03:17:21.324
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>

7850
03:17:21.390 --> 03:17:22.230
<v Speaker 5>If he is,</v>

7851
03:17:22.500 --> 03:17:23.730
<v Speaker 5>if determinism is true,</v>

7852
03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:25.650
<v Speaker 5>who wrote the stories?</v>

7853
03:17:26.490 --> 03:17:28.050
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're Reddick has passed,</v>

7854
03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:28.711
<v Speaker 5>when you're right,</v>

7855
03:17:28.711 --> 03:17:28.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

7856
03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:30.510
<v Speaker 5>when you write a story on a computer,</v>

7857
03:17:31.200 --> 03:17:32.550
<v Speaker 5>did the computer write the story?</v>

7858
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.870
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

7859
03:17:33.870 --> 03:17:34.703
<v Speaker 5>You wrote the story,</v>

7860
03:17:34.810 --> 03:17:35.520
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

7861
03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:36.870
<v Speaker 5>But if determinism is true,</v>

7862
03:17:36.871 --> 03:17:41.250
<v Speaker 5>Stephen is just the computer and his buttons are being pushed by past events.</v>

7863
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:42.503
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

7864
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:44.370
<v Speaker 5>So that's why like one student asks me,</v>

7865
03:17:44.371 --> 03:17:44.521
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

7866
03:17:44.521 --> 03:17:46.620
<v Speaker 5>you should read a book by Sam Harris on determinism.</v>

7867
03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:46.801
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

7868
03:17:46.801 --> 03:17:46.951
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

7869
03:17:46.951 --> 03:17:48.270
<v Speaker 5>can you ask Sam who wrote the book?</v>

7870
03:17:48.890 --> 03:17:49.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

7871
03:17:49.140 --> 03:17:50.670
<v Speaker 5>who wrote the book on the terrorism is going to say,</v>

7872
03:17:50.671 --> 03:17:51.390
<v Speaker 5>well he did.</v>

7873
03:17:51.390 --> 03:17:52.201
<v Speaker 5>Now he can write it.</v>

7874
03:17:52.201 --> 03:17:52.561
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>

7875
03:17:52.561 --> 03:17:55.980
<v Speaker 5>He's determined so that these are old philosophical questions that need to be</v>

7876
03:17:55.981 --> 03:17:56.401
<v Speaker 5>explored.</v>

7877
03:17:56.401 --> 03:17:57.330
<v Speaker 5>But they are,</v>

7878
03:17:57.331 --> 03:17:58.020
<v Speaker 5>like you say,</v>

7879
03:17:58.020 --> 03:17:59.160
<v Speaker 5>a mind bending,</v>

7880
03:17:59.161 --> 03:17:59.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

7881
03:17:59.580 --> 03:18:01.530
<v Speaker 5>very mind bending for us.</v>

7882
03:18:01.531 --> 03:18:03.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad we finally get this man to me too.</v>

7883
03:18:03.431 --> 03:18:05.100
<v Speaker 5>Like we can do about a hundred of sure.</v>

7884
03:18:05.430 --> 03:18:06.211
<v Speaker 5>Let's do it again,</v>

7885
03:18:06.211 --> 03:18:06.391
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

7886
03:18:06.391 --> 03:18:07.440
<v Speaker 5>How often are you in town?</v>

7887
03:18:07.530 --> 03:18:07.741
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
