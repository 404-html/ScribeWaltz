00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 2>if you just talk about this stuff I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done on a daily basis.</v>

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this at one day you </v>
<v Speaker 2>called me and you said,</v>

10
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.990

<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

11
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving an old Russian motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>through rice paddies and Vietnam.</v>

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 2>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of talk about that on stage.</v>

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm annoying as fuck a party if anyone's</v>

15
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

16
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 2>we went zip lining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>fuck fucking zip lining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one 20 on flight lines outside of </v>

18
00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost broke my fucking knees.</v>

19
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

20
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So I almost broke your knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knees.</v>

21
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>these flight lines are basically a zip </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines on steroids.</v>

23
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:14.791
<v Speaker 2>They're massive cables and then massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigs and you have to control your body </v>

24
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 2>in the wind so that you don't go over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred miles an hour because it's </v>

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 2>really hard to stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

26
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 2>if the winds are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll cancel them.</v>

27
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 2>We were already up into the hike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six miles.</v>

28
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>You take the hike all the way through </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ziploc flight line than hike.</v>

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 2>You hike for six miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like all fucking day flight line,</v>

30
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:38.071
<v Speaker 2>a mile and a half and then hiked to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next flight line than flight line two </v>

31
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 2>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're long.</v>

32
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking gangster there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bootleg Canyon in Vegas.</v>

33
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Go outside and do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>

34
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 2>How long is the ride?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rides?</v>

35
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Probably a minute and a half minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ma'am.</v>

36
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 2>You're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking flying.</v>

37
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 2>When a bug hits your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts.</v>

38
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 2>It hurts to get hit in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hidden fucking bugs by bugs.</v>

39
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.210

43
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>coasters in New Jersey and a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>single hit him in the face and broke his</v>

44
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>

<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

48
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>God's tired of seeing all of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite romance novels were fucking </v>

49
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Fabio and the cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

50
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone Fabio used to pose for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>romance covers.</v>

51
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Romance books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so fucking strange because they </v>

52
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.770
<v Speaker 1>were like men that didn't truly exist in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

53
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably where like </v>

54
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>monitors came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a man.</v>

55
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It was like half worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mandatory,</v>

56
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

60
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about getting hit by bugs and </v>

61
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking</v>

62
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no actual video of the,</v>

63
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goose hitting him in the face.</v>

<v Speaker 1>getting attention.</v>

<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

66
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>We all make a deal here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a goose that hit my face smacked</v>

67
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>of every fucking anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any of your.</v>

68
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was no romance novels would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>this long haired guy who was super </v>

69
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.591
<v Speaker 1>romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was essentially like a morph between </v>

70
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.051
<v Speaker 1>a man and a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a woman's desire for </v>

71
00:03:16.051 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Amanda's six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one like beautiful,</v>

72
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>handsome and blond man with this long </v>
<v Speaker 1>luxurious mane of hair and he was always</v>

73
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>like holding her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was like,</v>

74
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>she was just going limp and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding her body weight and that's what </v>

75
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>sold the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Because he did other authors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just do one author and that </v>

78
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.190
<v Speaker 1>would sell the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabio would sell the fucking book and it</v>

79
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a drawing is a drawing of </v>

80
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.731
<v Speaker 1>like a Fabio ass character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he would like Kim </v>

81
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians sued because some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some character and some </v>

82
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>commercial that looked like her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she sued,</v>

83
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

84
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I guess they contacted her and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to do it.</v>

85
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Was that a why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was that William shatner </v>

86
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.281
<v Speaker 2>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a William Shatner commercial </v>

87
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.171
<v Speaker 2>where Kim Kardashians comes rolling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a karate martial and has like </v>

88
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:01.171
<v Speaker 2>leathers on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

89
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:06.091
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was Kim Kardashian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashian video game that she had </v>

90
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with at first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

91
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>and then she sued them and now she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making shitloads of money off that game</v>

92
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>that an app is a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

93
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.370
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she sued last year for $20 million </v>

94
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 1>because there was a woman in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

95
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>in a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chick's name is,</v>

96
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:29.091
<v Speaker 1>it's an old navy commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman's name is Melissa Moe and </v>

97
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:32.240
<v Speaker 1>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she sued because they looked like </v>

98
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>his friends with Melissa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Well she's that musician girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I know there's probably a lot of girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Melissa.</v>

101
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

102
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you google it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>

103
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It was actually a deck loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melissa Mayer narrows.</v>

104
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Including a senator's assistant.</v>

105
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably quite a few of those </v>

106
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.190
<v Speaker 1>girls with that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that girl?</v>

107
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 1>She does look like Kim Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

108
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she looks like her a little bit,</v>

110
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.320
<v Speaker 1>but how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No girls with dark hair or allowed to be</v>

112
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>on TV anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's going on?</v>

113
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 1>We have to pretend that every girl with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark hair is pretending to be you.</v>

114
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>How fucking egotistical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's stealing her essence though.</v>

115
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>But that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

116
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes along and creates like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Bert Kreischer,</v>

117
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:17.361
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy with a beard who drinks and </v>

118
00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:18.150
<v Speaker 1>gets.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then you'd just go fly in.</v>

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 2>this and for sometimes they'll put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>parachute behind you to slow you down.</v>

159
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weather changed on us and I was </v>

160
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.641
<v Speaker 2>getting nervous because it's lightening </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're on these big steel platforms </v>

161
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:06.641
<v Speaker 2>in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the desert.</v>

162
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

163
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

164
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going right now.</v>

165
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe we should.</v>

166
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

167
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:16.061
<v Speaker 2>And I was already locked in and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent me of the winds picked up behind </v>

168
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:16.061
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

169
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 2>So they started pushing me and I came in</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot as fuck.</v>

170
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:22.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like these big stoppers that </v>

171
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:22.331
<v Speaker 2>are supposed to stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blew through all of them,</v>

172
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>blew through the emergency one and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>up into the rigging.</v>

173
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 2>I just remembered someone at the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the day say,</v>

174
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 2>renting passingly when in doubt legs </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

175
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>And so like when in doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw your legs out,</v>

176
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 2>looks pretty legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

177
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spread my fucking legs and I want to </v>

178
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Speaker 2>put the rigging rack my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fucking hit my tank.</v>

179
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I thought I broke my Cox's come out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I shoot like here's the worst part </v>

180
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>is I shoot back because you went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rigging.</v>

181
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I shot back 150 feet into the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out into the valley.</v>

182
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking stuck there.</v>

183
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 2>And the guy had to come out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

184
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I come in and the guy's like,</v>

185
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

186
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you have no fucking idea how lucky you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are that you just had your legs up and </v>

187
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

188
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

189
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:13.091
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would've broken if I'd had them </v>

190
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:13.091
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've gone up.</v>

191
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 2>My legs would have hit the rigging </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of me like straddling it and uh,</v>

192
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>and I would have fucking shattered my </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs easily.</v>

193
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Must have worried that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shatter your hip.</v>

194
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 2>The way you hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like that's brutal.</v>

195
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happened to me.</v>

196
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>And I know that sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing happened to me,</v>

197
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:33.000
<v Speaker 2>but you just go and went up like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of like going on in,</v>

198
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 2>breaking my legs like this and then pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and then shut all the way back.</v>

199
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it is is like as you're going </v>

200
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your legs were in the way,</v>

201
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 2>it'd be too much before the solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigging hits the.</v>

202
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 2>If your legs with your legs would've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would've hit the rigging.</v>

203
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.100
<v Speaker 2>But before the whole system does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>But instead it sounds ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

205
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 2>I look to the level of chance and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things I do,</v>

207
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the simplest ones where you get </v>

208
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.761
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only times I've been hurt was on a </v>

209
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:07.191
<v Speaker 2>blog and Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big inflatable kind of </v>

210
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>mattress where they have filled with air</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you lay on the end and then some guy</v>

211
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 2>jumps off a 30 foot dock and when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>lands,</v>

212
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:19.221
<v Speaker 2>it's Einstein's theory of relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every action there is an opposite and </v>

213
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:22.941
<v Speaker 2>equal reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you shoot up equally as high as he </v>

214
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:22.941
<v Speaker 2>went versus his weight.</v>

215
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>So if he's more than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you compensate for that and you go up</v>

216
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 2>in the air and you go into the water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

217
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

218
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt myself flipping and I'm not like </v>

219
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 2>a natural gymnast so I didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>flip.</v>

220
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 2>So I started kicking my legs so I kicked</v>
<v Speaker 2>him as hard as I could and I kicked both</v>

221
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 2>my hamstrings out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

222
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Fucking the most painful thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>found.</v>

223
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of my hamstrings out.</v>

224
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Just don't know in the sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't walk for like three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't walk for three good no walk</v>

226
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 2>for three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

227
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the water and I was literally </v>

228
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.940
<v Speaker 2>holding my legs and it's a kids camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always kids around me and I'm just </v>

229
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:04.940
<v Speaker 2>holding my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in massive pain.</v>

230
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.510
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need you to go again.</v>

231
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go again.</v>

232
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

233
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you need to go a couple of times with</v>

234
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:16.551
<v Speaker 2>these things to make sure that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the shot and they can get at </v>

235
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>different angles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

236
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

237
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

238
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:23.751
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had to carry me to the firmer </v>

239
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 2>at this Christian youth camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go into my bag,</v>

240
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 2>take a handful of tenants because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

241
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt that pain in my life.</v>

242
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Just have travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I traveled with nausea medicine and </v>

243
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 2>painkillers always because you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if you get hurt and if you get hurt</v>

244
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the outback in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the Sahara,</v>

245
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get fucking.</v>

246
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 2>So you get attacked by a fucking line </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not going to die.</v>

247
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 2>But you have a fucking six hour bumpy </v>
<v Speaker 2>car ride in.</v>

248
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I want painkillers and I'm prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painkiller addiction.</v>

249
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

250
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Telling us about no painkiller addiction</v>

251
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They scare me.</v>

252
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you are hurt,</v>

253
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 2>like when I believe that the hamstrings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed two viking in pop them and I </v>

254
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 2>was manageable until they got me to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

255
00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.710
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just sit and wait.</v>

256
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>They had to fucking wait forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a prayer circle around me.</v>

257
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Prayer circle what kind of prayers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Jesus being God's counsel </v>

258
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.160
<v Speaker 2>counselor played along with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he did write quotes,</v>

259
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.970
<v Speaker 2>learning realm because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

260
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.720
<v Speaker 2>this looks like the guy from 30 rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like the white blonde haired,</v>

261
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 2>Nerdy Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

262
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 2>He like all these kids around my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around my bed.</v>

263
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you all thinking what I'm thinking?</v>

264
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

265
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert,</v>

266
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.100
<v Speaker 2>do you mind if we bury on you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

267
00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:38.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking out of it if I got into </v>

268
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:38.101
<v Speaker 2>and hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm presuming.</v>

269
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:38.101
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

270
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 2>bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

271
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

272
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.130
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it up.</v>

273
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.260
<v Speaker 2>I probably said sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love that Carson.</v>

274
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.340
<v Speaker 2>So they form a circle so awkward because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of it and I like,</v>

275
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 2>instead of the kids hands on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>

276
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:58.921
<v Speaker 2>But I wanted to touch him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I grabbed his inner like thigh and </v>

277
00:11:58.921 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding the counselors hand and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>preyed on me,</v>

278
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but then they preyed on me and I prayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and it was awesome.</v>

279
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 2>I always have emergency like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well these days when I've been traveling</v>

281
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:16.561
<v Speaker 2>abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always bring a little baby bottles of </v>

282
00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.631
<v Speaker 2>Jack Daniel's with me on my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the flights because a lot of these </v>

283
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:18.631
<v Speaker 2>airlines don't serve alcohol.</v>

284
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you go to places where alcohol is </v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal in some Muslim countries where </v>

285
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.300
<v Speaker 2>alcohol is illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

286
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just in Zanzibar.</v>

287
00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 2>We can get alcohol and I didn't get much</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

288
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Most Muslim countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

289
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>even um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even Dubai,</v>

290
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.170
<v Speaker 2>you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

291
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Get it in bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in bars it's like,</v>

292
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 2>because they want to accommodate </v>
<v Speaker 2>westerners and especially Europeans.</v>

293
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Europeans love to drink and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a tourist location.</v>

294
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big killers.</v>

295
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:46.981
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these large Muslim investors </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going into Muslim countries like </v>

296
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Zanzibar and buying up hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not comfortable with alcohol</v>

297
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:54.601
<v Speaker 2>and new and like bathing suits and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most beautiful hotels in all of </v>

298
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 2>East Africa are just Muslim owned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

299
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 2>they're vacant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dead.</v>

300
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing but lizards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

301
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody wants to go into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

302
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:07.501
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No market dictates your ideas are </v>

303
00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:07.501
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

304
00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Chicks wear bikinis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you said no haters.</v>

305
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 2>They had a sports bar and the one we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in and I said,</v>

306
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a heineken and the manager </v>
<v Speaker 2>came up to me so you know,</v>

307
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>we're a Muslim hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't serve alcohol.</v>

308
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a sports bar,</v>

309
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.470
<v Speaker 2>you changed the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't say it.</v>

310
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 2>The sport is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I read sports bar.</v>

311
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>What did they say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

312
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks at me and goes,</v>

313
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want like appearance goes for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the night.</v>

315

<v Speaker 2>I want to 12 pack.</v>

316
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

317
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 2>me in your room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10 came.</v>

318
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.590

<v Speaker 2>sec,</v>

319
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>don't take them out of your room so she </v>
<v Speaker 2>can smell that.</v>

320
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 2>He had bought the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bought the hotel within,</v>

321
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I would say within weeks of what?</v>

322
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Of US booking the entire trip and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they still had a stock of alcohol,</v>

323
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.600
<v Speaker 2>so it was just changing over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was just changing over to a Muslim </v>

324
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.720
<v Speaker 2>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took the chance though,</v>

325
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had known that.</v>

326
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.440
<v Speaker 2>I would've never fucking say they're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a million.</v>

327
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

328
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like having the place to yourself</v>

329
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.560
<v Speaker 2>is really because no one was at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one would go there and if they are </v>

330
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 2>there and they're Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in the pool.</v>

331
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 2>So the pool to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>

332
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made me cover up my tattoos.</v>

333
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>Japan's fucking weird like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

334
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.810

<v Speaker 2>Japan or any of the big train stations?</v>

335
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Fucking silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will talk to each other.</v>

336
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a video on my phone.</v>

337
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 2>It's probably my computer of me sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the.</v>

338
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:35.340
<v Speaker 2>At what is their times square in Tokyo </v>
<v Speaker 2>at rush hour at like 8:00</v>

339
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 2>AM in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>6:00</v>

340

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

343

344
00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:45.751
<v Speaker 2>at my crew and no one's talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

345
00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Now we're not talking to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>because no one's talking.</v>

346
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that law of,</v>

347
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever dictates.</v>

348

350
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.790
<v Speaker 2>stood with the guy and the other way was</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing the wrong direction.</v>

351
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.991
<v Speaker 2>We went and looked at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it stops and someone comes in </v>

352
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:01.991
<v Speaker 2>phases while direction again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then after the third person,</v>

354
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 2>when that they face the wrong direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who was facing the fucking doors</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're doing some crazy shit.</v>

447
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Every time I talked to you like I'm in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shark tank in the middle of the ocean.</v>

448
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get out of that fucking thing.</v>

451
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 1>We were with great white sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck man,</v>

452
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't be doing that itself.</v>

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Africa and the fucking the visibility we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit so,</v>

454
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.870
<v Speaker 2>so they were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would draw them in with a big tuna </v>

455
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 2>head and then they would start up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shark would just appear shark attack</v>

456
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.720
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are simulating real shark attacks in </v>

457
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:13.720
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just come up on the cage and just.</v>

458
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.120
<v Speaker 2>So I got frustrated and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see where the shark was so I</v>

459
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 2>could predict it grew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scare me.</v>

460
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.160
<v Speaker 2>So I was sitting on top of the cage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sitting there.</v>

461
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>We're looking for the shark and dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like out of a fucking movie.</v>

462
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>The shark leaps at the tuna head above </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water and right at me and I shit in </v>

463
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.851
<v Speaker 2>my wet suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went fucking song and I was like </v>

710
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:37.211
<v Speaker 5>same reason because I'm fucking myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>over so many times and when you fuck </v>

00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:40.271
<v Speaker 5>yourself over the wrong or Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're always going to remember that </v>

712
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:40.820
<v Speaker 5>like motherfucker call me jeff or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

713
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have a hard time letting go of a </v>

714
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.120
<v Speaker 5>hard time remembering names.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

715
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.900
<v Speaker 5>of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the thing.</v>

716
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:53.590
<v Speaker 5>There's a certain number that you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>in your head and you get past that </v>

717
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.000
<v Speaker 5>number and it's called Dunbar's number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>150 people in your head.</v>

718
00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.550
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you got room for fuck.</v>

719
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.040
<v Speaker 5>You get more than 150 people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to delete names.</v>

720
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.160
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't have like friendships </v>
<v Speaker 5>with more than 150 people.</v>

721
00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:07.250
<v Speaker 5>You just don't have the data base.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I spent those numbers up in like</v>

722
00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:07.880
<v Speaker 5>third grade.</v>

723
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.710
<v Speaker 5>When I look at the yearbook and look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the kids older than me,</v>

724
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.860
<v Speaker 5>they're still people older than me in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Berkeley prep high grade school that I </v>

725
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.470
<v Speaker 5>remember them distinctly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

726
00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:18.470
<v Speaker 5>I remember looking at those pictures and</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing the hot girls,</v>

727
00:31:18.471 --> 00:31:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Holly Clifford,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now I still remember her.</v>

728
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.060
<v Speaker 5>I remember was her picture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked like people that had an impact</v>

729
00:31:23.061 --> 00:31:24.710
<v Speaker 5>on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to remember them for sure.</v>

730
00:31:24.711 --> 00:31:28.760
<v Speaker 5>You're always going to remember them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people that like if you meet a bunch</v>

731
00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:30.920
<v Speaker 5>of people on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how many people you're meeting,</v>

732
00:31:30.921 --> 00:31:35.921
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about you did 60 fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows and how many people are on each </v>

733
00:31:35.921 --> 00:31:36.470
<v Speaker 5>show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's like 120 people already.</v>

734
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's no way.</v>

735
00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:39.950
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you gonna remember all </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

736
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 5>It's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's people that were on fear </v>

737
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 5>factor and I'll meet him again and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

738
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

739
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Where do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to remember where I know we did </v>

740
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:49.640
<v Speaker 5>the thing with the bowl and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

741
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.770
<v Speaker 5>oh hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you doing?</v>

742
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

743
00:31:51.861 --> 00:31:53.990
<v Speaker 5>I have access to those files again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

744
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 5>like my brain will go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

745
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:56.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me pull that up here.</v>

746
00:31:56.421 --> 00:32:00.260
<v Speaker 5>It is like in my regular brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my regular memory,</v>

747
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 5>it just wasn't available.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But your brain will give you access to </v>

748
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.930
<v Speaker 5>these files if you pull them up every </v>
<v Speaker 5>now and then.</v>

749
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:11.110
<v Speaker 5>Like if you delete certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could still find them like they're </v>

750
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.891
<v Speaker 5>in your trash but you have an empty your</v>
<v Speaker 5>trash yet saying it gives you a chance </v>

751
00:32:15.231 --> 00:32:20.231
<v Speaker 5>to pull them back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think it gets to a certain point </v>

752
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:21.740
<v Speaker 5>and then you no more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no more file does not exist.</v>

753
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

754
00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:25.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm done with the files and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreaming so much,</v>

755
00:32:25.191 --> 00:32:28.700
<v Speaker 5>so intensely that I'm literally like </v>
<v Speaker 5>going through every morning and I'm like</v>

756
00:32:28.701 --> 00:32:32.930
<v Speaker 5>fucking 13 dreams that are remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's kind of fucking with my day.</v>

757
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.940
<v Speaker 5>Are you having so many dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea,</v>

758
00:32:34.941 --> 00:32:37.610
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I broke my gov with that.</v>

759
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the lucid,</v>

760
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:39.990
<v Speaker 5>like I got really into</v>

761
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>lucid dreaming and I was lucid dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

762
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Still am today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last night had a dream about I'm getting</v>

763
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:50.681
<v Speaker 2>arrested at the Hillsborough River Lake </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bunch of my friends and I was in </v>

764
00:32:50.681 --> 00:32:53.371
<v Speaker 2>my underwear and they had the dogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting us down and then I woke up and </v>

765
00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 2>they'd thrown tear gas at us and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs were standing over us and we're </v>

766
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.891
<v Speaker 2>handcuffed and that's like me and four </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends spread out and I woke up and I </v>

767
00:32:59.891 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not done with that cop because I'm,</v>

768
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanting to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed to do justice in that dream.</v>

769
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:07.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I went back to sleep and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>started dreaming immediately about that </v>

770
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.591
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that we actually </v>

771
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:11.591
<v Speaker 2>talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we talk about this?</v>

772
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:15.560
<v Speaker 2>We have Alpha brain and what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized is my,</v>

773
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.740
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lucid dreaming is attached to Alpha </v>

774
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.991
<v Speaker 2>brain in the sense that our would give </v>
<v Speaker 2>me energy and make me think quicker and </v>

775
00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:22.991
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

776
00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was caffeine or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in it.</v>

777
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

778
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no caffeine,</v>

779
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.580
<v Speaker 2>it's probably colding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acetylcholine is something that people </v>

780
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:30.580
<v Speaker 2>reported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take it,</v>

781
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a really intense dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

782
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.370
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.380
<v Speaker 2>one of the universal things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about Alpha brain is the dream </v>

784
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.130
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said it makes,</v>

785
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 2>it feels like I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

786
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a lucid dreamer where I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have any techniques and practice it,</v>

787
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:48.611
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally I found myself in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and when I find myself in that </v>

788
00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:48.611
<v Speaker 2>state where I realized that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming,</v>

789
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 2>it feels like it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

790
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it always used to feel like a child's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble.</v>

791
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you blow a bubble,</v>

792
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 2>like if you touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pops.</v>

793
00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>It became like a basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could bounce this motherfucker </v>

794
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 2>around like this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could bounce it around.</v>

795
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I never pursued it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pursued it,</v>

796
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you got into the techniques in you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got into like getting your mind in </v>

797
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 2>the right state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

798
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.340
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just blacking out and passing out drunk.</v>

799
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you said you got in lucid </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream practicing it.</v>

800
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is is that I,</v>

801
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I found myself waking up and being able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get back into dreams and then I went,</v>

802
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:28.601
<v Speaker 2>there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I found myself for a big chunk of </v>

803
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:32.081
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big chunk being in a dream state for </v>

804
00:34:32.081 --> 00:34:32.081
<v Speaker 2>almost the entire night without </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping.</v>

805
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I put this on the sensitivity of </v>

806
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:37.540
<v Speaker 2>my fitbit watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it on the sensitivity,</v>

807
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 2>very sensitive when I sleep I'm always </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping really like sleeping like three</v>

808
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:42.620
<v Speaker 2>to four hours a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

809
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm out the whole night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm having these intense really,</v>

810
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

811
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.330
<v Speaker 2>in like all encompassing dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

812
00:34:51.331 --> 00:34:51.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

813
00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:56.721
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was weaving my way in and out of </v>

814
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:56.721
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

815
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:56.721
<v Speaker 2>I was having my way with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

816
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:57.950
<v Speaker 2>there were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like next level.</v>

817
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I talked about it on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Shane Moss and I ended up.</v>

818
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 2>But he asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him and then I ended up crying in</v>

819
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 2>the middle of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is about buddy who killed himself,</v>

820
00:35:05.781 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>but it was such a surreal fucking dream </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

821
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that even telling anyone about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

822
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

823
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:16.811
<v Speaker 2>are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever think about like reading </v>

824
00:35:16.811 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 2>books on it and getting deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods that people use to achieve those</v>

825
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>states?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

826
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I did online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a bunch about dreaming online.</v>

827
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I even took it as far as how I </v>

828
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:28.090
<v Speaker 2>became obsessed with it and I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do a dream cast right.</v>

829
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Bring in like a Zen Buddhist monk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relax you and get you to sleep.</v>

830
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.770
<v Speaker 2>And then for like for like seven minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get you to sleep and then give you a </v>

831
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:42.321
<v Speaker 2>period of two minutes silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I am like the dream weaver and </v>

832
00:35:42.321 --> 00:35:42.321
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

833
00:35:42.321 --> 00:35:42.740
<v Speaker 2>all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in like.</v>

834
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 2>And so as you're sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it happens to me a lot.</v>

835
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I know I've told you that I'll have </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams of you.</v>

836
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I dream of viewing fitzsimmons hanging </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in my living room talking and I just</v>

837
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.400
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys all my podcasts and I was </v>

838
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:55.400
<v Speaker 2>sleeping and it was just immersing </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in my head.</v>

839
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

840
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 2>it was so funny because whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were talking about,</v>

841
00:35:56.911 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I had an opinion and I kept trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupt you guys.</v>

842
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on bird bird,</v>

<v Speaker 2>order to stay sane because my dreams are</v>

846
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:16.260
<v Speaker 2>like fucking literally when I say 13 </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams tonight that I remember sometimes</v>

<v Speaker 2>you one.</v>

850
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And then as I tell you one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will untangle all the other ones.</v>

851
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

856
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.550
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

857
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I called Doug Benson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember my dreams are so intense.</v>

858
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:39.531
<v Speaker 2>At one point I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug Benson asked me to leave them to </v>

859
00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:41.661
<v Speaker 2>him on his answering machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I leave him on his answering machine </v>

860
00:36:41.661 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he puts them on.</v>

861
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Doug loves minis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we put my dreams on Douglas.</v>

862
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

863
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:52.370
<v Speaker 2>like I had a dream one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what my funnier dreams as an </v>

864
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 2>answering machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's his voicemail voicemail,</v>

865
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 2>this car phone to call his answering </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

866
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Had a dream one time that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

868
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm onstage and I'm standing like this.</v>

869
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hands on the hips,</v>

870
00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 2>a very feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more flamboyantly gay than feminine.</v>

871
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 2>If a woman did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be confused.</v>

872
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>So I look and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

873
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 2>And there's a curtain right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm like,</v>

874
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.440
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked to the left and I see four </v>

875
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 2>dudes staggard stance to it with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two behind us in Klan outfits,</v>

876
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:30.530
<v Speaker 2>a Klux Klan outfits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I look and sometimes there'll be a </v>

877
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 2>mirror on the side of the stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look and I see me,</v>

878
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:36.471
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a clean up it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hauling white and I've got a </v>

879
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 2>dunce cap on and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's close enough.</v>

880
00:37:37.051 --> 00:37:42.051
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I don't look just like them </v>

881
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:42.051
<v Speaker 2>people I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the dream.</v>

882
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:46.041
<v Speaker 2>I thought travel channel's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed when they see that I'm dancing </v>

883
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:46.041
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like and all of a sudden I hear the</v>

884
00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 2>curtains start to pull back and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to get off stage and I hear ladies</v>

885
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 2>and gentlemen put your hands together </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the click clack cleanse and we start</v>

886
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:58.581
<v Speaker 2>tap dancing and I've always wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tap dance and we start tap dancing and </v>

887
00:37:58.581 --> 00:37:59.000
<v Speaker 2>just fucking hammering it out.</v>

888
00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

889
00:37:59.831 --> 00:38:01.470
<v Speaker 2>CanNot stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so much fun.</v>

890
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 2>And then I woke up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benson,</v>

891
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:08.811
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream to be a great sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The click clack clans should write this </v>

892
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived on Doug Benson's answering,</v>

893
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 2>make a sketch out about these guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the clan,</v>

894
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 2>but they feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't hate black people anymore and</v>

895
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 2>they want to entertain and spread their </v>
<v Speaker 2>new message.</v>

896
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.740
<v Speaker 2>They clicked so they start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start going around the country,</v>

897
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>tap dancing and align the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter so many black people.</v>

898
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:32.721
<v Speaker 2>They can become racist again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turned back around and people get really</v>

899
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 2>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crowes people</v>

900
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.350
<v Speaker 5>really mad at them because they're used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to being the clan like fucking bill,</v>

901
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.120
<v Speaker 5>but we're not in the cloud anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you we're not racist.</v>

902
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 5>We have a total change of heart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we already had the costumes.</v>

903
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 5>That's why we're wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

904
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.280
<v Speaker 5>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're just being big foods as the class.</v>

905
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.450
<v Speaker 5>By the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

906
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:52.390
<v Speaker 5>fuck black people back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm back.</v>

907
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm moving back to Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I moved back to the mountains,</v>

908
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
<v Speaker 5>back to deep woods to click clack clams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a period of my dreams,</v>

909
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 5>like a big chunk where they were like </v>
<v Speaker 5>cyclical and uh,</v>

910
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.930
<v Speaker 5>and had amazing endings like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was just like,</v>

911
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.940
<v Speaker 5>I was blown away and I was telling </v>
<v Speaker 5>Benson,</v>

912
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:18.950
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave me on my thing and I'll put them </v>

913
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.950
<v Speaker 5>on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started doing it.</v>

914
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 5>And then what happens is I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 5>through this right now as I go through a</v>

915
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 5>big period.</v>

916
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I was leaving them a lot of malaria </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams because they're insane.</v>

917
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 5>And then I get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so.</v>

918
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm so keyed into dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm dreaming obsessively where I am </v>

919
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:30.610
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I'm having like fucking 30 to 35 a</v>

920
00:39:30.611 --> 00:39:35.611
<v Speaker 5>night and I can't stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You haven't been able to remember all 35</v>

921
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:36.970
<v Speaker 5>of them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

922
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously even if I listen to my </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams now,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What you did before you went to bed,</v>

954
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 5>what you drank that put you in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>catatonic state.</v>

955
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 5>We believe that you're in a bubble bath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the size of the Philadelphia </v>

956
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 5>Eagles Stadium floating in there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're naked,</v>

957
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:13.870
<v Speaker 5>but no one could see you because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>water's so high.</v>

958
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:14.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

959
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.340
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could have a bunch of different </v>

960
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:19.340
<v Speaker 5>fucking crazy dreams that you can just </v>
<v Speaker 5>relay.</v>

961
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:24.450
<v Speaker 5>You could have your kids tell their </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams or you could tell their kids to </v>

962
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 5>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would burn the boats of dreams.</v>

963
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:31.501
<v Speaker 5>It usually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like lately all my dreams had been </v>

964
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:31.501
<v Speaker 5>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all my dreams,</v>

965
00:41:31.501 --> 00:41:33.890
<v Speaker 5>a bit about comics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a dream about you and Debby Norton</v>

966
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

967
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.150
<v Speaker 2>bill burn a bunch of guys in a radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>show like two nights,</v>

968
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 2>two nights ago and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like all.</v>

969
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 2>They're all about comics right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

970
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly doing the road a lot I think </v>

971
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.590
<v Speaker 2>because I haven't been doing stand up as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as I'm able to stand up and so now </v>

972
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:54.101
<v Speaker 2>I've started back on stand up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I'm just inspired by a bunch of </v>

973
00:41:54.101 --> 00:41:54.950
<v Speaker 2>people who I feel like are doing it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot better than me.</v>

974
00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.610
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you said you haven't been doing </v>

975
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:00.610
<v Speaker 2>standup as much as you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>

976
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably met when doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show more than doing tv more than.</v>

977
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

978
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:08.920
<v Speaker 2>You put me in a weird quagmire when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the conversation of Vietnam,</v>

979
00:42:08.921 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 2>as I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

980
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:15.041
<v Speaker 2>So I've been very attentive to writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>material about these things that had </v>

981
00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:15.560
<v Speaker 2>been doing and I've been going back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at all the activities.</v>

982
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few like,</v>

983
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:21.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's really interesting,</v>

984
00:42:21.631 --> 00:42:26.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so often you hear comics come on the </v>

985
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:28.061
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll talk about writing new material </v>

986
00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:28.061
<v Speaker 2>and Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a beer.</v>

987
00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing new material and,</v>

988
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the versus the addiction of killing,</v>

989
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.620
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

990
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'd always thought because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>write on stage,</v>

991
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

992
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 2>I always right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about that.</v>

993
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.320
<v Speaker 2>But then this weekend I was in Columbus </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they noticed that when I would get </v>

994
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 2>into a spot where it was a genuine new </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit about scuba diving,</v>

995
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.710
<v Speaker 2>80 feet to go see a wrecker or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're riding the top fuel dragster </v>

996
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 2>jumping off this most of a Meta stadium </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when it started a bomb,</v>

997
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the panic feeling where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

998
00:42:55.731 --> 00:43:00.731
<v Speaker 2>I need to get out and do an old bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be able to own that bomb and </v>

999
00:43:00.731 --> 00:43:04.331
<v Speaker 2>sitting there and trust it and trust it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these people are going to get a </v>

1000
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:05.270
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit joke right now that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>

1001
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 2>but trust me one day it'll be better.</v>

1002
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Was there for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for writing.</v>

1003
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1004
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 1>that's where you should really fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and try to expand bits,</v>

1005
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to come up with new ways to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1006
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:21.041
<v Speaker 1>You take a lot of chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like club Gaffigan and I had a </v>

1007
00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:21.041
<v Speaker 1>conversation about this who was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1008
00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always do new shit,</v>

1009
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but I always want to make sure the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>

1010
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important thing.</v>

1011
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:29.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go up there and do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

1012
00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>like completely new stuff and bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like if it's all going bad,</v>

1013
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I will go to old stuff that I know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really works.</v>

1014
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>He's like the most important thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is that the show's good,</v>

1015
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>which makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're paying high ticket</v>

1016
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 1>dollar prices in theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a lot of stuff he's doing.</v>

1017
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.490
<v Speaker 1>He's got a kind of pretty big obligation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a good show.</v>

1018
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.820
<v Speaker 1>People got babysitters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came out there.</v>

1019
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where the La clubs come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where [inaudible] comes in here,</v>

1020
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the store,</v>

1021
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 1>at the Improv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going up and you know,</v>

1022
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going up with a skeleton of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke and trying to figure out what it </v>

1023
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recording it,</v>

1024
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.650
<v Speaker 1>listening to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back over it or record it.</v>

1025
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.590
<v Speaker 1>You record it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got an iphone.</v>

1026
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Just use your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still hard to do.</v>

1027
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1028
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it.</v>

1029
00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when I recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually say it differently than if I </v>

1030
00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:18.210
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's getting lost to the ethos,</v>

1031
00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.740
<v Speaker 2>then I feel like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the,</v>

1032
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.770
<v Speaker 2>it's in the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the moment and it's in live by </v>

1033
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:25.770
<v Speaker 2>the sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>die by the sword type shit.</v>

1034
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 2>You like doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1035
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Just takes longer to get a bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 2>The reality of recording</v>

1037
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.340
<v Speaker 1>is if you do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to say it any </v>

1038
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.261
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're recording every set that I </v>

1039
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:41.211
<v Speaker 1>have a record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every set is is like when it's 100% </v>

1040
00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:45.291
<v Speaker 1>of your sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never different because you're </v>

1041
00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:45.990
<v Speaker 1>recording what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it just becomes doing a set,</v>

1042
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:51.230
<v Speaker 1>so if I say something in the middle of I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to ponder afterwards,</v>

1043
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

1044
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I a recording because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times where you're saying things off the</v>

1045
00:44:56.341 --> 00:45:00.420
<v Speaker 1>cuff and that's the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the line and dude,</v>

1046
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're not recording that line can </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape you.</v>

1047
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It can leave you and never return it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take yourself into some </v>

1048
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:12.801
<v Speaker 1>strange place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange headspace because when you're </v>

1049
00:45:12.801 --> 00:45:16.521
<v Speaker 1>doing a bit something might happen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone might react to it in a certain </v>

1050
00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:17.790
<v Speaker 1>way and because they react to it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain way,</v>

1051
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1052
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:23.451
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking the and that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of the joke and that just came out </v>

1053
00:45:23.451 --> 00:45:25.200
<v Speaker 1>of that particular moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't capture that,</v>

1054
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you might not ever be able to recreate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in your memory because you're in that</v>

1055
00:45:28.651 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>weird zen state when you're killing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem,</v>

1056
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.030
<v Speaker 1>like when you're really in the groove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in that zen state where you're </v>

1057
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.030
<v Speaker 1>barely there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1058
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.601
<v Speaker 1>you like a ride on this thing and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating all those new bits in </v>

1059
00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:46.401
<v Speaker 1>that sort of zen state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you can't remember what </v>

1060
00:45:46.401 --> 00:45:46.401
<v Speaker 1>you said.</v>

1061
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually end up saying out loud,</v>

1062
00:45:49.641 --> 00:45:51.050
<v Speaker 2>if I say something new that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1063
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can someone please tweet that to me?</v>

1064
00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:53.780
<v Speaker 2>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.180
<v Speaker 2>So friend tweeted me a Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids sucking Dick.</v>

1066
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.200
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck?</v>

1067
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.710
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by the end of the night I'm hammered.</v>

1068
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.430
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the idea that I was,</v>

1069
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the big goes because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said it in the moment,</v>

1070
00:46:08.481 --> 00:46:09.500
<v Speaker 2>but I'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1071
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:10.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1072
00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:16.570
<v Speaker 2>two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two guys watching gay porn is like </v>

1073
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.310
<v Speaker 2>giving your kid Sushi for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1074
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:18.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I like it.</v>

1075
00:46:18.231 --> 00:46:19.190
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't put in your mouth.</v>

1076
00:46:19.191 --> 00:46:19.850
<v Speaker 2>See what you think.</v>

1077
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.640
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you like getting like now and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>texture is going to freak me out.</v>

1078
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:23.840
<v Speaker 7>I heard it's expensive.</v>

1079
00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.190
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1080
00:46:27.191 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 2>hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get sick.</v>

1081
00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:28.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.450
<v Speaker 2>People if they get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always blamed Sushi.</v>

1083
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I got diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat Sushi,</v>

1084
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>

1085
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do you know you eat things </v>

1086
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.050
<v Speaker 2>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

1087
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.931
<v Speaker 2>You know that's what's funny about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's almost impossible to get </v>

1088
00:46:46.931 --> 00:46:49.250
<v Speaker 2>food poisoning from Sushi because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States Sushi is flash frozen.</v>

1089
00:46:49.251 --> 00:46:52.700
<v Speaker 2>It has to be frozen and then I re falled</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1090
00:46:52.701 --> 00:46:55.280
<v Speaker 2>so it's like almost impossible for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually.</v>

1091
00:46:55.310 --> 00:47:00.310
<v Speaker 2>That's not totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly certain ones can get </v>

1092
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.310
<v Speaker 2>parasites rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially freshwater fish,</v>

1093
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.950
<v Speaker 2>but when people get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's from the rice.</v>

1094
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I bet some people get sick from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>salmon to certain freshwater fishes.</v>

1095
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>

1096
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

1097
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't really have to worry about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much,</v>

1098
00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but the freshwater fish drink goat's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood with a chief the other day,</v>

1099
00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>like I just have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given up on any of that fucking </v>

1100
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I've been because I'm nervous eater </v>
<v Speaker 2>about stuff like that.</v>

1101
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Gross blood cut its throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poured it into a horn,</v>

1102
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.540
<v Speaker 2>put some grass in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shook it up,</v>

1103
00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:29.760
<v Speaker 2>gave it to me like why grass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not disgusting by itself.</v>

1104
00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 5>Some grass high enough historic mix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit up.</v>

1105
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Goldblatt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's your go blood Hyena Piss smoothie.</v>

1106
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Irony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It tasted like a liver was real.</v>

1107
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:50.490
<v Speaker 5>It was real myron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could feel it like 10 out of your </v>

1108
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:50.490
<v Speaker 5>mouth a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to make sense,</v>

1109
00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard scrabble life.</v>

1110
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 5>Being a goat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Goats live in places where there's not a</v>

1111
00:47:55.121 --> 00:48:00.121
<v Speaker 5>lot of water right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking water where we where </v>

1112
00:48:00.121 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 5>they can survive a long time with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>

1113
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 5>Those mountain goats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they must taste like shit.</v>

1114
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Tastes like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tastes great.</v>

1115
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 5>You eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We put them on skewers,</v>

1116
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Speaker 5>had a fire and then had the skewers </v>
<v Speaker 5>angled from the fire and just cooked.</v>

1117
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way they cook.</v>

1118
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I learned to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where they cooked.</v>

1119
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:19.021
<v Speaker 5>Medium rare too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well done is they stick that stick in </v>

1120
00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:19.220
<v Speaker 5>the fire that way and it cooks or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1121
00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:24.250
<v Speaker 5>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found I was meditating with a Zen </v>

1122
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.310
<v Speaker 5>Buddhist priest and in Japan they stick </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it so that there's a fire.</v>

1123
00:48:26.921 --> 00:48:31.921
<v Speaker 5>They stick the stick in this way and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how this is more well done and </v>

1124
00:48:31.921 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 5>this is less well done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's how they cook it.</v>

1125
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 5>You listened to people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to this,</v>

1126
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.390
<v Speaker 5>so try to explain this in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes sense.</v>

1127
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.600
<v Speaker 5>So if you're confused and I'm right in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you,</v>

1128
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.960
<v Speaker 5>you build a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1129
00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.890
<v Speaker 5>look at that on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are like,</v>

1130
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:47.250
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just mark it off to.</v>

1131
00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't listening and I don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck I'm talking about is a stick.</v>

1132
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 5>They stick it in the fire and then put </v>
<v Speaker 5>the meat on the stick.</v>

1133
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.040
<v Speaker 5>The skewer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stick,</v>

1134
00:48:55.700 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 5>the meat on a small size have this big </v>
<v Speaker 5>sport that's like fucking this long.</v>

1135
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.230
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking sharp shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stay.</v>

1136
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.780
<v Speaker 5>Make it sharpest shit and thin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they make a stick.</v>

1137
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:09.781
<v Speaker 5>They turn into a bar and then they </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically skewer all the goat's meat on </v>

1138
00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:09.781
<v Speaker 5>a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1139
00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 5>like a Kabob and then they shove it </v>
<v Speaker 5>right next to the fire,</v>

1140
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.310
<v Speaker 5>like two o'clock on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a clock.</v>

1141
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.920
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we put them all around the.</v>

1142
00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.590
<v Speaker 5>They put it all around the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

1143
00:49:17.591 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 5>like just like hands one o'clock and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>

1144
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 5>but they're angled out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still angled pointing away and I said,</v>

1145
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

1146
00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:30.421
<v Speaker 5>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the top ones aren't as well done in the </v>

1147
00:49:30.421 --> 00:49:32.611
<v Speaker 5>bottoms that are more well done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was really fucking </v>

1148
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:32.611
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1149
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:32.611
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My head,</v>

1150
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:37.531
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can just grill my shit like I could </v>

1151
00:49:37.531 --> 00:49:40.801
<v Speaker 5>actually be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I talked to him about wood and </v>

1152
00:49:40.801 --> 00:49:40.801
<v Speaker 5>it's really specific about what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wood you use.</v>

1153
00:49:40.801 --> 00:49:40.801
<v Speaker 5>Cancers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>use any wood,</v>

1154
00:49:40.801 --> 00:49:42.910
<v Speaker 5>so there's certain different types of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wood that people will cook with.</v>

1155
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 5>Especially in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's in America too.</v>

1156
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Like there's like if you watch those </v>
<v Speaker 5>barbecue contests,</v>

1157
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.100
<v Speaker 5>you ever see those barbecue?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Compress those gates.</v>

1158
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Fascinated those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get you wanting to smoke a meet dudes.</v>

1159
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Smoke a brisket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a cherry tree.</v>

1160
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.210
<v Speaker 5>Cherry tree do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had fucking beal,</v>

1161
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:03.510
<v Speaker 5>a venison sausage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat venison sausage some.</v>

1162
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.300
<v Speaker 5>I got some in my house is one of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>favorites.</v>

1163
00:50:07.301 --> 00:50:10.660
<v Speaker 5>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To mix pork fat into it though.</v>

1164
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:11.630
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1165
00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most venison sausages.</v>

1166
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:15.160
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Venison sausage,</v>

1167
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.010
<v Speaker 5>it's venison sausage with pork fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1168
00:50:18.011 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Cook Ground Venison,</v>

1169
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:24.931
<v Speaker 5>I take ground venison and I cook it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll use like gluten free pasta or like </v>

1170
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 5>sprouted grain pasta and I'll mix it all</v>
<v Speaker 5>together</v>

1171
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 1>with like some tomato sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fantastic.</v>

1172
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of the rare times where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people use ground venison by itself.</v>

1173
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Most ground venison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mix up with pork fat because it's </v>

1174
00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.911
<v Speaker 1>so lean because it's a healthy animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an animal that's running </v>

1175
00:50:42.911 --> 00:50:46.331
<v Speaker 1>around eating crops and grass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfalfa and shit and running all over </v>

1176
00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 1>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have much body fat on them.</v>

1177
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had just,</v>

1178
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 1>just the meat of the deer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sausage,</v>

1179
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 1>it would probably be really dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't like it.</v>

1180
00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of medicine as of late.</v>

1181
00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good for you,</v>

1182
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's the best though?</v>

1183

1189
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 1>They've killed so many elk that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain populations,</v>

1190
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.440
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of a America where the elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>population has dropped down to 20% of </v>

1191
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>its original size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like 50,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like giant herds of these cow elks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so she picks one out and she drops </v>

<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

1217
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing her,</v>

<v Speaker 1>knowing her as a person that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1219
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't really have a lot of experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoors at all.</v>

1220
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a crazy fitness person or</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extreme athlete is doing naughty </v>

1221
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.810
<v Speaker 1>things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she,</v>

1222
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a regular person,</v>

1223
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 1>very nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works in an office,</v>

1224

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works for Anthony Bourdain and 0.0</v>

1225
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:46.991
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden she's shooting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking elk in the mountains of Montana </v>

1226
00:52:46.991 --> 00:52:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and the snow and the woods and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild shit dude.</v>

1227
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you like cry or anything?</v>

1228
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 1>She was pretty.</v>

1229
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Not Cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could tell she was like real.</v>

1230
00:52:55.661 --> 00:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It was like an overwhelming experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1231
00:52:57.621 --> 00:52:59.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no words for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is how I felt too.</v>

1232
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.490
<v Speaker 1>The first time I shot a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1233
00:53:01.491 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 1>there's no words for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is wild.</v>

1234
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like hitting a home run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1235
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitting a home run.</v>

1236
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no sense of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird sense of loss when you,</v>

1237
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:13.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shoot an animal like a,</v>

1238
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to eat that animal so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel bad about it.</v>

1239
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I didn't feel bad about it.</v>

1240
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it for so long before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually did it.</v>

1241
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's a sense of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When can we hit a home run?</v>

1242
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1243
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Be</v>

1244
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 2>nothing else to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're getting an animal and you've</v>

1245
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:32.280
<v Speaker 2>got your hands inside its body and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel the hot body cavity.</v>

1246
00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:33.970
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo,</v>

1247
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:38.330
<v Speaker 2>one time we shot it up on crow nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>

1248
00:53:38.331 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was tough.</v>

1249
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 2>What show was this trip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went hunting with the crow,</v>

1250
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 2>really shut a buffalo buffalo up on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up on a perch,</v>

1251
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:50.541
<v Speaker 2>like a sniper was with the whole pack </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have to keep the male </v>

1252
00:53:50.541 --> 00:53:54.201
<v Speaker 2>population down because it fucks with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they know which one they're shooting </v>

1253
00:53:54.201 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 2>and they go out and they pop it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was really fascinating to me,</v>

1254
00:53:57.781 --> 00:54:00.920
<v Speaker 2>and I was either the small details of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story of overwhelming,</v>

1255
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 2>like when like the little thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't will,</v>

1256
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't normally talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

1257
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:10.040
<v Speaker 2>but what was funny to me was the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gallows humor that Crow Indians had </v>

1258
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 2>as they were gutting the l gutting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo.</v>

1259
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Like did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't disrupting disrespectful of</v>

1260
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:20.961
<v Speaker 2>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I guess they cut you cut out </v>

1261
00:54:20.961 --> 00:54:20.961
<v Speaker 2>it's asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:54:20.961 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>And then they like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were laughing as they cut up </v>

1263

<v Speaker 2>the asphalt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kids first time cutting the asshole</v>

<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

1265
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 2>like almost like morbid humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like comics kind of humor.</v>

1266
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you couldn't offend anyone in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle.</v>

1267
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 2>And then when they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your hand in Buffalo.</v>

1268
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:34.220

<v Speaker 2>when I kept saying in my head I was,</v>

1281
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.640
<v Speaker 2>it was similar to being a comic because </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics can't get offended.</v>

1282
00:55:02.641 --> 00:55:03.660

<v Speaker 1>that much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it sucks because it tastes really </v>

01:00:01.481 --> 01:00:01.481
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does suck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1395
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We plan ourselves.</v>

1396
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I want her to know about that trick when</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's six,</v>

1397
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:13.391
<v Speaker 1>not when she's 26 and she's throwing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the toilet to try to stay thin.</v>

1398
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them just like it's good to have </v>

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>fatty foods is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not.</v>

1400
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it's good to miss out on</v>

1401
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>all the pleasures in life because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get hooked on them.</v>

1402
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's horseshit.</v>

1403
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Like Bacon is fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I will never stop eating bacon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's too good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the saltiness and the sweetness of the </v>

<v Speaker 5>can get for your money.</v>

1449
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:47.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking my pink and pretty seriously </v>

1450
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 5>needs to go to a butcher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when you take him to the next </v>

1451
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1452
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 5>When you're really taking the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>

1453
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 5>When you raise your own fucking pigs </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk,</v>

1454
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:57.170
<v Speaker 5>raise your own pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get friendly with him and shoot him </v>

1455
01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.240
<v Speaker 5>right in the head because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta do.</v>

1456
01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.980
<v Speaker 5>We had this guy on the podcast name is </v>
<v Speaker 5>Joel Salitan and he's like a pretty </v>

1457
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.771
<v Speaker 5>famous farmer for writing books about </v>
<v Speaker 5>farming and he tries to recreate natural</v>

1458
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:12.171
<v Speaker 5>environments as much as possible and one</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the things he does with his pigs as </v>

1459
01:03:12.171 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 5>he puts them all inside a movable fence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the fence is enormous.</v>

1460
01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:19.461
<v Speaker 5>All the pigs are inside of this and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>he moves the fence and so the fence </v>

1461
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 5>moves to a new area and the pigs route </v>
<v Speaker 5>around eat acorns and nuts and all kinds</v>

1462
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 5>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then after,</v>

1463
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>x amount of days,</v>

1464
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:31.341
<v Speaker 5>they moved the fence to a new area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the pigs have a totally new area to </v>

1465
01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:34.581
<v Speaker 5>grace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has this enormous plot of land that </v>

1466
01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:37.161
<v Speaker 5>he does all this on and it's all like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little electric fences to keep the pigs </v>

1467
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.190
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the pigs are more like a wild pig.</v>

1468
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 5>They have like a dark texture to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're super healthy,</v>

1469
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:46.581
<v Speaker 5>but they maintain the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>characteristics of domesticated pigs </v>

1470
01:03:46.581 --> 01:03:50.691
<v Speaker 5>where they're not freaked out by people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not like fucking trying to run from me </v>

1471
01:03:50.691 --> 01:03:54.111
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I thought what you described </v>

1472
01:03:54.111 --> 01:03:56.571
<v Speaker 5>as like to remember Daniel Russo's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>halloween costume and the karate kid </v>

1473
01:03:56.571 --> 01:04:01.460
<v Speaker 5>shower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he could walk around and don't see </v>

1474
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:01.460
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it would.</v>

1475
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:01.460
<v Speaker 5>That was the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the pink pigs could move them.</v>

1476
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look like a three d term tabling.</v>

1477
01:04:05.491 --> 01:04:08.570
<v Speaker 5>The pigs could just keep walking their </v>
<v Speaker 5>fence around like a walker or.</v>

1478
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:13.580
<v Speaker 5>That's funny and I was like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>genius and then all of a sudden they </v>

1479
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 5>pigs are in town and they're all on that</v>
<v Speaker 5>fence.</v>

1480
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 5>The guys got to come put a fucking tow </v>
<v Speaker 5>hitch on the fence.</v>

1481
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.970
<v Speaker 5>Do one day they'll the oculus rift for </v>
<v Speaker 5>pigs.</v>

1482
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 5>They put it on them in the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing,</v>

1483
01:04:22.231 --> 01:04:27.231
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Danny Lussos costume for the chronic </v>

1484
01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:27.231
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1486
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:28.900

<v Speaker 5>I used to have a joke.</v>

1487
01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.390
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1488
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.320

1507
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.280
<v Speaker 5>Someone was a fan of the podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Banner.</v>

1543
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.840
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking hamstringing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched it on pot brownies or cookies </v>

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.500
<v Speaker 5>or some form of edible and I'm just </v>

<v Speaker 5>There was some scene where the guy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the girl are talking and it was so fake.</v>

1548
01:07:37.071 --> 01:07:38.240
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1549
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:43.260
<v Speaker 5>I lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost the trance of the movie because </v>

1550
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:43.260
<v Speaker 5>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can do that.</v>

1551
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Like I think tons of what you can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that too.</v>

1552
01:07:43.761 --> 01:07:48.761
<v Speaker 5>You can either dial you in so you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that no one would get or you can </v>

1553
01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden see the costumes on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>actors.</v>

1554
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:55.280
<v Speaker 5>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially animals,</v>

1555
01:07:55.281 --> 01:08:00.281
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make you super sensitive to bad </v>

1556
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:00.281
<v Speaker 5>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1557
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>if you go see like that fucking Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Day Lewis movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>My milkshake with the fuck was that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there will be blood.</v>

1560
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.450

<v Speaker 1>it'll lock you in and you'd be like,</v>

1562
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.740

<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

1563
01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Have to kill this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drank a milkshake like,</v>

1564
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1565
01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember any of that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember as I'm swimming in like 40 feet</v>

1566
01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:31.900
<v Speaker 2>out in the Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a good fucking movie.</v>

1567
01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.110
<v Speaker 2>He finds out that his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not his brother,</v>

1568
01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.400
<v Speaker 2>and he fucking take them back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach and skill.</v>

1569
01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:37.500
<v Speaker 2>How about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoiler alert,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who Listen Christ you haven't fucking </v>

1571
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.171
<v Speaker 2>watched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I know a lot of people that haven't </v>

1572
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:45.171
<v Speaker 2>seen yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>erase,</v>

1573
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:46.210
<v Speaker 2>erase bad memories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Race.</v>

1574
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:08:47.761 --> 01:08:49.380
<v Speaker 2>That guy is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to do it.</v>

1576
01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever it is that acting is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy knows how to do it.</v>

1577
01:08:52.201 --> 01:08:54.420
<v Speaker 2>He's that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1578
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:59.550
<v Speaker 2>Towns with New York's gangs in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time I realized I was</v>

1579
01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:04.551
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I remember seeing the last of </v>

1580
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:04.551
<v Speaker 2>the Mohicans when I was a kid and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1581
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:04.551
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good movie.</v>

1582
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:04.920
<v Speaker 2>But I thought there'd be more action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

1583
01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't appreciate acting or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1584
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I saw games in New York,</v>

1585
01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother Fucker,</v>

1586
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.660
<v Speaker 2>this guy is that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's.</v>

1587
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>He committed.</v>

1588
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1589
01:09:14.051 --> 01:09:19.051
<v Speaker 1>he's in the groove man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he does that with a bunch of </v>

1590
01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:21.631
<v Speaker 1>different characters too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I played that Ira guy who was a </v>

1591
01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:22.240
<v Speaker 1>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was called the boxer,</v>

1592
01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1593
01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that was like the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance of an actor pretend to be a </v>

1594
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:30.961
<v Speaker 1>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most realistic because it looked </v>

1595
01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:33.361
<v Speaker 1>like real boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas opposed to like a lot of these </v>

1596
01:09:33.361 --> 01:09:34.300
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what a lot of people are missing is</v>

1597
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the choreography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows one guy teeing off on the other</v>

1598
01:09:38.561 --> 01:09:42.490
<v Speaker 1>guy and that's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality.</v>

1599
01:09:42.491 --> 01:09:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It's usually exchanges like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting each other,</v>

1600
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>like the good guy gets hit to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at like,</v>

1601
01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.800
<v Speaker 1>like Marky mark's movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the,</v>

1602
01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boxer,</v>

1603
01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was his movie?</v>

1604
01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:54.850
<v Speaker 1>The fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fighter.</v>

1605
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's boxed before,</v>

1606
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choreography of the boxing scenes,</v>

1607
01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.170
<v Speaker 1>this is very unrealistic.</v>

1608
01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It didn't look anything like watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey Ward fight.</v>

1609
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.870
<v Speaker 1>If you watch mickey ward fight mean he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking shots.</v>

1610
01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.370
<v Speaker 1>He had this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1611
01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:12.610
<v Speaker 1>this ear muff style defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept his hands up high.</v>

1612
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.030
<v Speaker 1>He would come in and he takes shots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw vicious body punches.</v>

1613
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.690
<v Speaker 1>But you're marky mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hands are down.</v>

1614
01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.010
<v Speaker 1>It's faces out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a real boxer.</v>

1615
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Day Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1616
01:10:22.811 --> 01:10:27.811
<v Speaker 1>the guy had been punched in the face </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a difference between the </v>

1617
01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:27.811
<v Speaker 1>guy who gets punched in the face all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1618
01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>the way they hold their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're actually aware that </v>

1619
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.701
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then guys who just not thinking it </v>

1620
01:10:35.701 --> 01:10:35.701
<v Speaker 1>can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get hit at all.</v>

1621
01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if you're hitting the bag</v>

1622
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:40.060
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in a movie,</v>

1623
01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:45.061
<v Speaker 1>you're playing boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important that you look like </v>

1624
01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:45.061
<v Speaker 1>someone who might get hit in the face</v>

1625
01:10:45.061 --> 01:10:46.530
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to an actor who knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cameras</v>

1626
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:51.810
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the camera is and knows </v>

1627
01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:53.271
<v Speaker 1>how to throw the punches together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's unrealistic because the guy's </v>

1628
01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>not hitting you back like it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like the guy can't hit you back.</v>

1629
01:10:55.201 --> 01:10:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not scared of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not posturing.</v>

1630
01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Like Daniel Day Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his hands up,</v>

1631
01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing punches,</v>

1632
01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>he's throwing his left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His right hand is here.</v>

1633
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>When he throws his right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his left hand's here at shoulders are </v>

1634
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.511
<v Speaker 1>hunched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not standing like some fucking </v>

1635
01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:11.511
<v Speaker 1>superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's standing like a boxer.</v>

1636
01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>He's like making his target small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His footwork is excellent.</v>

1637
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.400
<v Speaker 1>The Way He's delivering the Jab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand combination.</v>

1638
01:11:18.401 --> 01:11:20.420
<v Speaker 1>The one two combination looks very </v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth.</v>

1639
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything looks real and he boxed for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full year.</v>

1640
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Before he did that role for a full year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker trained every day he </v>

1641
01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 1>got up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went jogging.</v>

1642
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>He lived like a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to the gym,</v>

1643
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.760
<v Speaker 1>he hit the mets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit the speed bag,</v>

1644
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>hit the heavy bag.</v>

1645
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>He did rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put fucking vaseline on his face and </v>

1646
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sent him out there with a cup on.</v>

1647
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 1>They beat the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it for a year.</v>

1648
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:47.511
<v Speaker 1>Do a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived like a pro boxer for a fucking </v>

1649
01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:49.660
<v Speaker 1>year and when that movie came around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really looked like a boxer.</v>

1650
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see the movie warrior?</v>

1651
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Which one's the one with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately I did.</v>

1652
01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>That one made me cry also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a good move.</v>

1653
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It was a good movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great movie.</v>

1654
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:06.360
<v Speaker 1>It was poorly executed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as money concerned.</v>

1655
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It was preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1656
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.230
<v Speaker 1>you would never make people fight two </v>
<v Speaker 1>days in a row.</v>

1657
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It would never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because two days in a </v>

1658
01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.991
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day you get beat the fuck up </v>

1659
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:17.991
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the people who win,</v>

1660
01:12:17.991 --> 01:12:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the next day you're sore as fuck.</v>

1661
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Your body's all beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your head might be,</v>

1662
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:24.150
<v Speaker 1>you might have internal swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1663
01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit that goes on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys after a serious emma,</v>

1664
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:32.040
<v Speaker 1>so you could never do two fights in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row where you're going to war like that.</v>

1665
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just not happening because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not happening.</v>

1666
01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

1667
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1668
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>the premise could have been achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a realistic scenario.</v>

1669
01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you could have people fight more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than one time at a night.</v>

1670
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 1>That's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have done that.</v>

1671
01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 1>They barely limp into the final round </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

1672
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.440
<v Speaker 1>but people have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have fought three times in a </v>

1673
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:51.440
<v Speaker 1>night that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they did it</v>

1674
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.650
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>

1675
01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:57.730
<v Speaker 2>That Horian Gracie hex hex or hoist </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

1676
01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:58.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1677
01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:03.781
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's in Hickson and that when </v>

1678
01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:03.781
<v Speaker 2>he fought twice in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1679
01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>that was Japan valley too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1680
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:07.360
<v Speaker 1>about three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three times.</v>

1681
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Two or three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but three times is not uncommon.</v>

1682
01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Back then they used to have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>

1683
01:13:12.071 --> 01:13:17.071
<v Speaker 1>They did that recently on glory man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Showing guy was in here a couple of </v>

1684
01:13:17.071 --> 01:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made it to the fucking finals man.</v>

1685
01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>He fought three times in a night against</v>
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>

1686
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>He's finding killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought this guy.</v>

1687
01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:29.820
<v Speaker 1>The first guy he fought was undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fights him and then he fights another</v>

1688
01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:35.371
<v Speaker 1>guy who had beaten him and then he goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the finals and fights arguably the </v>

1689
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:37.150
<v Speaker 1>best middleweight in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was fucking ridiculous.</v>

1690
01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time to.</v>

1691
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:39.940

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.400

<v Speaker 2>I was there last week.</v>

1693
01:13:43.401 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They were fucking massive.</v>

1747
01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.280
<v Speaker 2>They were heckling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fucking bad.</v>

1748
01:15:58.281 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't,</v>

1749
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know these three dudes,</v>

1750
01:16:01.371 --> 01:16:06.371
<v Speaker 2>I never met them other than I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were armed because that's what the </v>

1751
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 2>manager said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The manager told you they were armed and</v>

1752
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:07.740
<v Speaker 2>kick them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do it.</v>

1753
01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>They were heckling so bad they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>leased credo.</v>

1754
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:14.690
<v Speaker 2>They elected her so bad that she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very visibly upset.</v>

1755
01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy goes on next feature </v>
<v Speaker 2>act and his hair is matt.</v>

1756
01:16:18.531 --> 01:16:21.500
<v Speaker 2>He's like Balding Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit like feathered covered.</v>

1757
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes off it's matted sweaty</v>
<v Speaker 2>to his bald head and he's just fucking </v>

1758
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:26.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1759
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:27.470

<v Speaker 2>They're ruining the show.</v>

1760
01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.370
<v Speaker 2>And so I told the manager who's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for a long time now.</v>

1761
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:32.810
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1762
01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>can you ask them to leave or tell them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be quiet?</v>

1763
01:16:34.941 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there armed.</v>

1764
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna fucking say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say anything.</v>

1765
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1766
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I think he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1767
01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.170
<v Speaker 2>take one on the Chin and here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1768
01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>These people just take over their club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1769
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:58.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The possible potential threat of </v>

1770
01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:01.241
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're letting these people just </v>

1771
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:01.241
<v Speaker 2>dictate what goes on in their club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're letting these people believe,</v>

1772
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.140
<v Speaker 2>believe the club around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on,</v>

1773
01:17:03.141 --> 01:17:03.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the deal.</v>

1775
01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd argue to say this,</v>

1776
01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:08.480
<v Speaker 2>that you probably hit up but her </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

1777
01:17:08.481 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 2>but you're very different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Or Bobby Kelly,</v>

1778
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
<v Speaker 5>but like I feel like there's a New York </v>
<v Speaker 5>vibe and I just know how to deal with </v>

1779
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.730
<v Speaker 5>that bad element where they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting kicked out.</v>

1780
01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:18.770
<v Speaker 5>They've already paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be sitting here.</v>

1781
01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 5>So I would just ask them questions that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I already had the answers to that were </v>

1782
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 5>set up to my jokes or bits I could get </v>
<v Speaker 5>into.</v>

1783
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:29.350
<v Speaker 5>And then they were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to just ruined the shot.</v>

1784
01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people just want to ruin a </v>
<v Speaker 5>show to have a good time.</v>

1785
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:36.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all hecklers not created equal.</v>

1786
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 5>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people heckled shit and it's,</v>

1787
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.340
<v Speaker 5>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1788
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:40.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1789
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:43.490
<v Speaker 5>I've dealt with a number of hecklers and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>

1790
01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:46.700
<v Speaker 5>and I feel like starting in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

1791
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.200
<v Speaker 5>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not easy,</v>

1792
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:50.060
<v Speaker 5>but you just know how to fucking shut it</v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

1812
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not changing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like really self indulgent,</v>

1814
01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 5>actory type thinking.</v>

01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Well then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would have a hard time with </v>

1816
01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:48.041
<v Speaker 5>hecklers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're a guy that's like a guy </v>

1817
01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:50.501
<v Speaker 5>who did stand up at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the store doesn't have any </v>

1818
01:18:50.501 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 5>crowd control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I started out there.</v>

1819
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 5>No one ever stopped anybody from young </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit out.</v>

1820
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Very similar mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same as New York that would kick people </v>

1821
01:18:59.650 --> 01:18:59.650
<v Speaker 5>out though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit get ugly.</v>

1822
01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:03.670
<v Speaker 5>They would kick people out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were just figuring out a way to do </v>

1823
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:03.670
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See I'm.</v>

1824
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:06.571
<v Speaker 5>I am the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the exact opposite of that in that </v>

1825
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:08.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm maybe not perfect for hecklers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I want everyone to like me.</v>

1826
01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.600
<v Speaker 5>That's a massive fucking underlying tone</v>
<v Speaker 5>to my personality.</v>

1827
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:14.330
<v Speaker 5>Even if they say something hurtful or </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean,</v>

1828
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:17.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't snap on them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes a lot for me to stop.</v>

1829
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.460
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should just as a craftsman,</v>

1830
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:24.490
<v Speaker 5>not snap on them immediately anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it's the funny thing to do and </v>

1831
01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:24.490
<v Speaker 5>you've got to know when it is.</v>

1832
01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:28.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like a weird sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's funny to just snap on </v>

1833
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.450
<v Speaker 5>someone right away and not as long as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't really mean it.</v>

1834
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 5>Like that's the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't actually be angry when </v>

1835
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.820
<v Speaker 5>you snapping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There has to be a smile there.</v>

1836
01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:40.050
<v Speaker 5>I mean like a real legitimate smile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to be enjoying yourself and it </v>

1837
01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:43.691
<v Speaker 5>has to be that what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're putting on an improvised </v>

1838
01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:43.691
<v Speaker 5>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with these variables,</v>

1839
01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:45.700
<v Speaker 5>these people in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you can do that,</v>

1840
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:47.730
<v Speaker 5>you can manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can make a like a,</v>

1841
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.430
<v Speaker 5>a crazy situation become fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like some people can't.</v>

1842
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:54.740
<v Speaker 5>It's not their style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people style is,</v>

1843
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 5>I prepared a performance and if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>heckled me,</v>

1844
01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:02.951
<v Speaker 5>you're ruining what I've prepared and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I prepared is not better than </v>

1845
01:20:02.951 --> 01:20:07.181
<v Speaker 5>dealing with you and you're fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 5>for all these people around you and </v>

1846
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:07.181
<v Speaker 5>they're right to man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1847
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Live performances or weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't control.</v>

1848
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy agreement that works most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>

1849
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:18.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a great testament to how fucking </v>

1850
01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.590
<v Speaker 1>cool people are that stand up works as </v>
<v Speaker 1>often as it does mean when everybody </v>

1851
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>looks shit like we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

1852
01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:28.041
<v Speaker 1>about how the news is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>highlighting all these negative things </v>

1853
01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:31.250
<v Speaker 1>because really what the news is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment show and the best way to </v>

1854
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 1>get you to be paying attention is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scare you,</v>

1855
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:38.750
<v Speaker 1>not to show you robust views of happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thriving in this world and being </v>

1856
01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>loving and successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great majority of people,</v>

1857
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:49.610
<v Speaker 1>way more than just small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That small percentage gets to the news </v>

1858
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.620
<v Speaker 1>and so you look at the news like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's over run with cons,</v>

1859
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1860
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:58.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that's what they're showing </v>

1861
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what's in front of you.</v>

1862
01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:00.360
<v Speaker 1>If you look at how many goddamn clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows go on,</v>

1863
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 1>the great majority of people are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1864
01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:09.260
<v Speaker 1>The great majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a very few people that go one </v>

1865
01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>out of 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 600.</v>

1866
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I like the thing that drives me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts than heckling as those people who </v>

1867
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.600
<v Speaker 1>talk to other people about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what drives me nuts as a table of</v>

1868
01:21:18.601 --> 01:21:23.601
<v Speaker 1>eight where a guy's talking across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and you've seen him leaning </v>

1869
01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:23.601
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing like,</v>

1870
01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:24.030

<v Speaker 1>let's say like don't mind heckling.</v>

1871
01:21:24.031 --> 01:21:29.031
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's the way to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy was black from him saying that </v>

1872
01:21:29.031 --> 01:21:32.181
<v Speaker 1>racism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather know you're fucking racist </v>

1873
01:21:32.181 --> 01:21:32.181
<v Speaker 1>and know where my les than have you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it behind my back then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like your son's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's people that talk,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they think they are.</v>

1897
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.730
<v Speaker 1>They think they're going to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like,</v>

1898
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:38.900
<v Speaker 1>like when someone throws a haymaker at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you just get out of the way of </v>

<v Speaker 1>having a conversation with a stand up </v>

1903
01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:46.950
<v Speaker 1>instead of being able to say to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of this guy sucks.</v>

1904
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Now this guy's gonna focus on you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip up.</v>

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 1>You're just kinda okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're some fucking comedy wizard</v>

1906
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:54.440
<v Speaker 1>that's undercover,</v>

<v Speaker 1>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

1909
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get beaten up by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a real comic.</v>

1910
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:02.610
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be able to chew you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they don't think that.</v>

1911
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:04.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't think that they think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>

1912
01:23:04.381 --> 01:23:09.381
<v Speaker 1>Like when people see people fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many times where </v>

<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

1917

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.080
<v Speaker 1>what are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think he sees the right hand </v>

1919
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:22.080
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's right in front of them.</v>

1920
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.491
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're talking </v>

1922
01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:26.491
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were trying to do this.</v>

1923
01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:26.491
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they.</v>

1924
01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:31.410
<v Speaker 1>If they actually got out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would shit their pants and realize </v>

1925
01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:31.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1926
01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:35.221
<v Speaker 1>this is a moving target that's better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this than me and they're moving faster </v>

1927
01:23:35.221 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 1>than I can move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get hit in the head.</v>

1928
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then really thinking about getting a</v>

1929
01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 1>hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He try to throw a punch.</v>

1930
01:23:40.031 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1931
01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you throw a punch,</v>

1932
01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your fucking head knocked back.</v>

1933
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.570
<v Speaker 1>That that's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are watching shit,</v>

1934
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:52.660
<v Speaker 1>they're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confidence plus booze.</v>

1935
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They give this stupid distorted idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are in the greater spectrum </v>

1936
01:23:57.810 --> 01:24:02.761
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're better at something </v>

1937
01:24:02.761 --> 01:24:02.761
<v Speaker 1>than you without even ever dealing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>

1938
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Amazing how fast a real life punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how you're right.</v>

1939
01:24:06.591 --> 01:24:11.591
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a dance move in your </v>

1940
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:11.840
<v Speaker 2>head versus the dance move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really do.</v>

1941
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I've only done one punch and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

1942
01:24:14.631 --> 01:24:19.631
<v Speaker 2>When I did that cracked my nose on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee because I ducked way too fucking </v>

1943
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:20.570
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went black and fucking was like,</v>

1944
01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the reality of it is you go,</v>

1945
01:24:23.481 --> 01:24:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I know what to do by just have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>done the dance myself.</v>

1946
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

1947
01:24:28.491 --> 01:24:28.560
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

1948
01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.650
<v Speaker 1>guy did a reason why he looks so good as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boxer.</v>

1949
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:34.530
<v Speaker 1>He was out there moving with real </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxers,</v>

1950
01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:35.970
<v Speaker 1>getting hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ducking,</v>

1951
01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:38.190
<v Speaker 1>bobbing and weaving so that when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

1952
01:24:38.191 --> 01:24:43.191
<v Speaker 1>he had a realistic sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements that you would actually be </v>

1953
01:24:43.191 --> 01:24:45.030
<v Speaker 1>performing while you're fighting as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to like a lot of guys like,</v>

1954
01:24:45.031 --> 01:24:46.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I might hit him with a punch.</v>

1955
01:24:46.591 --> 01:24:51.210
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go falling back to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>your face is wide open up bob and you're</v>

1956
01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>not leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1957
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1958
01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:58.610
<v Speaker 1>it's unrealistic sense of competence </v>
<v Speaker 1>without experience is the sign of a </v>

1959
01:24:59.131 --> 01:25:02.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really common thing,</v>

1960
01:25:02.011 --> 01:25:07.011
<v Speaker 1>especially with men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men with testosterone and alcohol </v>

1961
01:25:07.011 --> 01:25:08.940
<v Speaker 1>combined with very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few,</v>

1962
01:25:08.941 --> 01:25:13.941
<v Speaker 1>very few real live experiences as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really having to pull yourself up,</v>

1963
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:18.150
<v Speaker 1>really having to dig down deep and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what your character is all about.</v>

1964
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys going through life</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never find out who the fuck they </v>

1965
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:23.360
<v Speaker 1>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the going gets rough,</v>

1966
01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never been there,</v>

1967
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>so their idea of what they're capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how they would respond to those </v>

1968
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:33.711
<v Speaker 1>situations is based on fucking movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on like hero bullshit movies.</v>

1969
01:25:34.681 --> 01:25:39.681
<v Speaker 1>You know the Guy Kicks Your Butt Jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm fucking door kick her </v>

1970
01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:39.681
<v Speaker 1>buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw u two video,</v>

1971
01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kick this guy's ass.</v>

1972
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Kicked the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those that's terrifying.</v>

1973
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:45.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is.</v>

1974
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:48.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a wild like no one knows that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen here.</v>

1975
01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.960
<v Speaker 1>This is completely improvisational and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it involves violence and involves you </v>

1976
01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:58.251
<v Speaker 1>being successful at achieving violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>on someone who's probably been doing it </v>

1977
01:25:58.251 --> 01:25:59.220
<v Speaker 1>way longer than you know the way better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at you.</v>

1978
01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Just like a comic is way better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking jokes and a person who's never </v>

1979
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:04.400
<v Speaker 1>been on cracking jokes.</v>

1980
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 5>When you see actors play comics and </v>
<v Speaker 5>movies and you go,</v>

1981
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1982
01:26:08.241 --> 01:26:13.241
<v Speaker 5>you're clearly acting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were clearly are because you never </v>

1983
01:26:13.241 --> 01:26:15.341
<v Speaker 5>did stand up because I know right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if there was a stand up to him that </v>

1984
01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:19.271
<v Speaker 5>he would simply be doing stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd be filming it as opposed to </v>

1985
01:26:19.271 --> 01:26:20.740
<v Speaker 5>watching them act as if they're font.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1986
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.810
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking painful and fucking sally </v>
<v Speaker 5>field.</v>

1987
01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:27.940
<v Speaker 5>I was just thinking one is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1988
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.460
<v Speaker 5>it's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lord.</v>

1989
01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 5>Still fucking one with um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no.</v>

1990
01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:32.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was.</v>

1991
01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.680
<v Speaker 5>There's more that have been out like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1992
01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:38.681
<v Speaker 5>but we just watched someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly not a standup in your life like </v>

1993
01:26:38.681 --> 01:26:39.410
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think seth Rogan's very funny,</v>

1994
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 5>but he's not a stand up stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's not.</v>

1995
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.020
<v Speaker 5>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>

1996
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:48.420
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen this Canadian </v>

1997
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.310
<v Speaker 5>performance he has on his first </v>
<v Speaker 5>performance in Canada?</v>

1998
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:50.660
<v Speaker 5>Online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should watch it,</v>

1999
01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a really funny.</v>

2000
01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:55.400
<v Speaker 5>I think he's hilarious in all his </v>
<v Speaker 5>movies.</v>

2001
01:26:55.401 --> 01:26:57.290
<v Speaker 5>I think he's an amazing writer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An amazing actor.</v>

2002
01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:59.660
<v Speaker 5>I love watching the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just when I saw him in that movie,</v>

2003
01:26:59.661 --> 01:27:01.670
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a great actress in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we did stand up.</v>

2004
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.680
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was doing a version of </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else that people thought he </v>

2005
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 5>would be doing as opposed to seth rogen </v>
<v Speaker 5>the movies.</v>

2006
01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 5>I watch the movies I watched when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched him be funny.</v>

2007
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.820
<v Speaker 5>That is not him being funny like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's not the translation of that.</v>

2008
01:27:13.821 --> 01:27:18.821
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another problem is what when they have </v>

2009
01:27:18.821 --> 01:27:18.821
<v Speaker 5>those movies were guys who stand up on </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

2010
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:21.260
<v Speaker 5>The materials never good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2011
01:27:21.261 --> 01:27:26.261
<v Speaker 5>You know why you're never going to give </v>
<v Speaker 5>you good material that you could use </v>

2012
01:27:26.261 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 5>their fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

2013
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:31.870
<v Speaker 5>If I come up with a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I'm writing for a movie about stand </v>

2014
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.870
<v Speaker 5>up and I come up with a really good </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea,</v>

2015
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going in that Muslim village </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going over here.</v>

2016
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:39.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to store that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give you some mediocre </v>

2017
01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.201
<v Speaker 5>nonsense that you could add.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always think that about writers for </v>

2018
01:27:41.201 --> 01:27:41.900
<v Speaker 5>like a productivity shows that started </v>
<v Speaker 5>up stand up.</v>

2019
01:27:41.901 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way I couldn't.</v>

2020
01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 5>I could never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd never write for anybody.</v>

2021
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:46.370
<v Speaker 5>I can never write for anybody that can </v>
<v Speaker 5>never,</v>

2022
01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:51.700
<v Speaker 5>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could never take material from other </v>

2023
01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:51.700
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to.</v>

2024
01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.640
<v Speaker 5>It all needs to be mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It needs to come from you entirely.</v>

2025
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.890
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it needs to be my words.</v>

2026
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 5>Some guys can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have the time,</v>

2027
01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing a bunch of movies and so </v>

2028
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:02.280
<v Speaker 5>they just don't.</v>

2029
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.260
<v Speaker 5>They're terrible writers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

2030
01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:05.260
<v Speaker 5>with hiring writers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's what you want to do.</v>

2031
01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:05.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

2032
01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:07.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2033
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 5>most of my friends don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anybody who does it.</v>

2034
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:13.220
<v Speaker 5>I know a guy who does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know him personally,</v>

2035
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.560
<v Speaker 5>but it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2036
01:28:16.561 --> 01:28:17.300
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2037
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.090
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2038
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:23.100
<v Speaker 5>an honest exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know when Larry the cable guy </v>

2039
01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.980
<v Speaker 5>doing it or Jeff Foxworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your bill angle.</v>

2040
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:30.340
<v Speaker 5>I just think anyone who's not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>household name in that respect,</v>

2041
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just thought I just fucking tap out.</v>

2042
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 5>1996.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seth rogen doing standup comedy in </v>

2043
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2044
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2045
01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:40.110
<v Speaker 5>he's a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard him on me.</v>

2046
01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:43.470
<v Speaker 5>The company talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He definitely started out as a colleague</v>

2047
01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:46.880
<v Speaker 5>county in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2048
01:28:46.881 --> 01:28:49.220
<v Speaker 5>he's probably not doing stand up right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now under.</v>

2049
01:28:49.221 --> 01:28:51.800
<v Speaker 5>I think he did a little bit for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie to prepare for it,</v>

2050
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.920
<v Speaker 5>but he's not doing it enough to where </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got like 20 killer minutes that he </v>

2051
01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.530
<v Speaker 5>could do in the movie and they give him </v>
<v Speaker 5>some whack ass material.</v>

2052
01:29:00.531 --> 01:29:02.390
<v Speaker 5>The good stuff going to use on stage,</v>

2053
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:07.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use it for a special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to use it like if you're a </v>

2054
01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.071
<v Speaker 1>comic especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guys who were good comics are </v>

2055
01:29:10.071 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>the guys who are going to be good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing standup comedy.</v>

2056
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:14.460
<v Speaker 1>If someone's never done standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just theoretical.</v>

2057
01:29:14.461 --> 01:29:19.461
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not their jokes are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that write for </v>

2058
01:29:19.461 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms that have never done stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and never performed,</v>

2059
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.240
<v Speaker 1>and they have some ideas what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be funny in a scene and </v>

2060
01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:26.610
<v Speaker 1>occasionally there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2061
01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2062
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 1>But they're wrong is almost as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right.</v>

2063
01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they're really good writers,</v>

2064
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a really good show with we've got a </v>

2065
01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:39.800
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a good feel of the dynamic </v>

2066
01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 1>of these situations and what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be funny about the pause and what can be</v>

2067
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 1>funny about this line in response to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause,</v>

2068
01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them are just guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guessing like you'll get scripts.</v>

2069
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some scripts I've read.</v>

2070
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I've read a script recently where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But that's a lot of it out there man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Go Watch an episode of fucking two and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half men.</v>

2076
01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Sheen left Jesus Christ though </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a heart attack.</v>

2077
01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.400

<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2086
01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:42.920
<v Speaker 5>I read that some of his writings from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Aziz Ansari wrote a blog about him.</v>

2087
01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 5>The kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his writings were fucking hilarious.</v>

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

2089
01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:49.550
<v Speaker 5>I think I met him one time in Houston a </v>
<v Speaker 5>long time ago.</v>

2090
01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:52.480
<v Speaker 5>We worked the door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but who he is,</v>

2091
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:55.670
<v Speaker 5>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to translate even being</v>

2092
01:30:55.671 --> 01:30:58.420
<v Speaker 5>funny on stage to writing a script and </v>
<v Speaker 5>making it funny.</v>

01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Really fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2094
01:31:00.411 --> 01:31:03.290
<v Speaker 5>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to get a real genuine sense of</v>

2095
01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:08.291
<v Speaker 5>interaction between two human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're trying to put in punch </v>

2096
01:31:08.291 --> 01:31:08.690
<v Speaker 5>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

2097
01:31:08.691 --> 01:31:12.110
<v Speaker 5>Some people are so bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got fucking really spoiled because the</v>

2098
01:31:12.111 --> 01:31:16.880
<v Speaker 5>writers on news radio were really good </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have no idea how to play that show us</v>

2099
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.590
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just as an outside wall.</v>

2100
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:21.980
<v Speaker 5>Someone who watches it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you have no idea.</v>

2101
01:31:21.981 --> 01:31:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Like because you had to deal with Andy </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick every day.</v>

2102
01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.660
<v Speaker 5>It was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2103
01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:27.800
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like even just working with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

2104
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:31.070
<v Speaker 5>like on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the outside looking in and Dick was</v>

2105
01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:35.120
<v Speaker 5>so goddamn hilarious on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real tragedy that,</v>

2106
01:31:35.121 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 5>that character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2107
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:39.680
<v Speaker 5>that didn't turn him into fucking what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ben Stiller is,</v>

2108
01:31:39.681 --> 01:31:41.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just crazy.</v>

2109
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.480
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he got the Andy Dick show and all</v>

2110
01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:49.481
<v Speaker 5>the other stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Andy will tell you himself that it was </v>

2111
01:31:49.481 --> 01:31:51.821
<v Speaker 5>more battling demons and anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a lot of demons thing that he's</v>

2112
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:57.460
<v Speaker 5>talking about on his instagram the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>day I looked at it and it was a him </v>

2113
01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:57.920
<v Speaker 5>drinking some healthy drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2114
01:31:57.921 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 5>thank God I'm addicted to something </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy for once.</v>

2115
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's his,</v>

2116
01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his deal.</v>

2117
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It just is always going to be as deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we used to do scenes.</v>

2118
01:32:05.711 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 1>We had to do it like three or four times</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't fucking not laugh.</v>

2119
01:32:08.710 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break,</v>

2120
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he drove me nuts on this set.</v>

2121
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

2122
01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2123
01:32:15.011 --> 01:32:20.011
<v Speaker 1>out of all the times we worked together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't drive me nuts the majority of </v>

2124
01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that bad.</v>

2125
01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:25.110
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became way more out of control after </v>

2126
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he left the show that he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

2127
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>like really getting arrested and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2128
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 1>That didn't go on while I was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys have a set of.</v>

2130
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:36.750

2147
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:17.491
<v Speaker 1>people back there.</v>

2149
01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Melissa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hearing I remember.</v>

2150
01:33:20.411 --> 01:33:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard for Geraldo say she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fun to party with.</v>

2151
01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:25.120
<v Speaker 1>She liked to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:27.720
<v Speaker 1>she likes to get fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's hilarious too.</v>

2153
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.640
<v Speaker 1>She's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a really good actress,</v>

2154
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 1>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it.</v>

2155
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:36.390
<v Speaker 1>She's so good that sometimes we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing scenes and I wouldn't really know </v>

2156
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that we started doing the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be.</v>

2157
01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought she was just talking because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2158
01:33:38.621 --> 01:33:42.490
<v Speaker 1>like she was like so natural the way she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would act as it was really natural,</v>

2159
01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of creepy.</v>

2160
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it'd be like woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that's the craft,</v>

2161
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.840
<v Speaker 1>the craft of like sliding effortlessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a role with no bullshit about it </v>

2162
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that's very hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people to do and it's very </v>

2163
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 1>hard for a lot of people to write that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way as well.</v>

2164
01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got to,</v>

2165
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.590
<v Speaker 1>for an actor,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They would write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very specific,</v>

2169
01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:13.060
<v Speaker 1>very um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like clear character Jimmy James.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He met him.</v>

2171
01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:17.680

<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2175
01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dumb but not really interested in </v>

2176
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 1>like he was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>renewed.</v>

2180
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:37.480
<v Speaker 1>That shows one of my favorite shows I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen ever on television.</v>

2181
01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Quantum leap number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shone number two.</v>

2182
01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2183
01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:46.411
<v Speaker 1>we're in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The company got moved nine times.</v>

2184
01:34:46.751 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 1>News radio moved nine times before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

2185
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:51.870
<v Speaker 1>so there was no internet back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was in internet.</v>

2186
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess the Internet sort of started in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1994,</v>

2187
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but nobody was using it to find out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>time shows were on.</v>

2188
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:02.120
<v Speaker 1>The amount of people that were on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet back then was fucking nil.</v>

2189
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2190
01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it was during Dialup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was during 14,</v>

2191
01:35:06.631 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dialogue,</v>

2192
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:13.210
<v Speaker 1>that's when it started fucking 14 form </v>
<v Speaker 1>baud modems when everything was slow as </v>

2193
01:35:17.091 --> 01:35:22.091
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to download a picture of </v>

2194
01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:22.091
<v Speaker 1>tits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like chunk,</v>

2195
01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:22.490
<v Speaker 1>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk,</v>

2196
01:35:22.491 --> 01:35:25.250
<v Speaker 1>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also start off now.</v>

2197
01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And then it's a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will be loaded by the time I come,</v>

2198
01:35:27.511 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but they get past her tits and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's jerking off.</v>

2199
01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 1>She's Kinda tick the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the show moved nine different times.</v>

2200
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.060
<v Speaker 1>So it'd because you guys weren't like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>definite hit.</v>

2201
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when it hits,</v>

2202
01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it brings the cast closer together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2203
01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean we definitely couldn't get a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

2204
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:51.850
<v Speaker 1>which is good because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that get big heads when they get </v>

2205
01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:51.850
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around.</v>

2206
01:35:51.850 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

2207
01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:58.001
<v Speaker 1>So often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the other day about </v>

2208
01:35:58.001 --> 01:35:58.001
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2209
01:35:58.001 --> 01:36:01.930
<v Speaker 1>this show where this guy got on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then immediately start acting like a </v>

2210
01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:03.080
<v Speaker 1>cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just thought he was.</v>

2211
01:36:03.081 --> 01:36:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Every reality show the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolved around.</v>

2212
01:36:05.691 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows us,</v>

2213
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the whole world revolved around them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to fucking ruining his </v>

2214
01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.641
<v Speaker 1>entire career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that just happens when things get </v>

2215
01:36:15.641 --> 01:36:18.551
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happens when certain people </v>

2216
01:36:18.551 --> 01:36:21.401
<v Speaker 1>get successful when especially like </v>
<v Speaker 1>actors and there's all a part of them </v>

2217
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:23.510
<v Speaker 1>that almost like serial killers want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get caught.</v>

2218
01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:28.070
<v Speaker 1>This is a part of actors where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

2219
01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:33.071
<v Speaker 1>They act so ridiculous that they almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>want someone to call them on it.</v>

2220
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2221
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 1>they almost want someone to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2222
01:36:38.811 --> 01:36:41.000
<v Speaker 1>you're being a fucking cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

2223
01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2224
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:46.620
<v Speaker 1>ever clearly was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a comedy movie that my friend </v>

2225
01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.161
<v Speaker 1>did with this guy and the guy's a famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and in the middle of the scene he </v>

2226
01:36:51.161 --> 01:36:52.940
<v Speaker 1>just starts smashing this car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't.</v>

2227
01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:57.941
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he starts kicking at his car and he </v>

2228
01:36:57.941 --> 01:37:01.811
<v Speaker 1>breaks the windows and he breaks his </v>
<v Speaker 1>side mirror off and you just fucking </v>

2229
01:37:01.811 --> 01:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>picks up something and smashes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>against his car.</v>

2230
01:37:02.721 --> 01:37:07.721
<v Speaker 1>Fucks his car up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know it was somebody's car </v>

2231
01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 1>over his productions car or what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he felt like he was such a big deal.</v>

2232
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:16.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a very famous guy that at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>he just felt like he gets smashed this </v>

2233
01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:16.450
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2234
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>So just smashed the car on set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2235
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he kind of went crazy like he </v>

2236
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 1>but he went crazy because he could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

2237
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 1>They cleaned it all up and he paid for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the damage was in the car and </v>

2238
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 1>that's where it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2239
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things.</v>

2240
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:38.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that if you're in the </v>

2241
01:37:38.021 --> 01:37:38.021
<v Speaker 1>teamsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do the craft service guy.</v>

2242
01:37:38.021 --> 01:37:39.470
<v Speaker 1>The craft service guy can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2243
01:37:39.471 --> 01:37:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pay for that car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked it up.</v>

2244
01:37:40.941 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2245
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go to jail.</v>

2246
01:37:43.551 --> 01:37:44.990
<v Speaker 1>You asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2247
01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you'll pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you do pay for it,</v>

2248
01:37:47.001 --> 01:37:48.530
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't work here anymore.</v>

2249
01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how good your egg </v>
<v Speaker 1>sandwiches.</v>

2250
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>You can't smash someone's car because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking burnt and egg.</v>

2251
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:59.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you're an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get this sense that it's okay </v>

2252
01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:03.261
<v Speaker 1>for you to just smash this fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of makes people go nutty </v>

2253
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 1>when they get famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When things go really well for them.</v>

2254
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.980
<v Speaker 1>We never got famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never went well.</v>

2255
01:38:11.010 --> 01:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>We were on television and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard for people to just enjoy the</v>

2256
01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:17.490
<v Speaker 1>moment of being on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a lot of conversations we</v>

2257
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:22.491
<v Speaker 1>had on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like a balanced perspective was </v>

2258
01:38:22.491 --> 01:38:25.401
<v Speaker 1>required because they will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this show is after </v>

2259
01:38:25.401 --> 01:38:28.761
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is bullshit that show fucking </v>

2260
01:38:28.761 --> 01:38:31.011
<v Speaker 1>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why are they after Seinfeld that </v>

2261
01:38:31.011 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 1>show fucking socks and why can't we be </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Thursday nights?</v>

2262
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2263
01:38:32.821 --> 01:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>this is so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2264
01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I remember we were having this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2265
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:41.061
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well last time I checked we're on </v>

2266
01:38:41.061 --> 01:38:41.061
<v Speaker 1>fucking TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a TV show,</v>

2267
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's still in the year.</v>

2268
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:44.970
<v Speaker 1>We're in like season three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy.</v>

2269
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:49.990
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's probably no perspective at the </v>

2270
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:49.990
<v Speaker 5>time that you guys were getting to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Phil Hartman.</v>

2271
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.230
<v Speaker 5>Who is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a blessing.</v>

2272
01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.690
<v Speaker 5>It was definitely a perspective in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2273
01:38:53.691 --> 01:38:54.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we definitely,</v>

2274
01:38:54.861 --> 01:38:59.060
<v Speaker 5>I definitely recognize Phil and Dave </v>
<v Speaker 5>Foley equally important.</v>

2275
01:38:59.061 --> 01:39:01.280
<v Speaker 5>Dave Foley was the glue that kept that </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole.</v>

2276
01:39:01.281 --> 01:39:01.790
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2277
01:39:01.791 --> 01:39:05.030
<v Speaker 5>I see that guy slot producer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see that guy running that Kyle,</v>

2278
01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:08.650
<v Speaker 5>you run into him a wink,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2279
01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.320
<v Speaker 5>Our kids go to the same school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I always want to stop them and I </v>

2280
01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:14.320
<v Speaker 5>always want to stop him and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2281
01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm never good at meeting celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

2282
01:39:15.981 --> 01:39:17.420
<v Speaker 5>sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go like,</v>

2283
01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:18.980
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know Joe Rogan and,</v>

2284
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:20.600
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and are just do it.</v>

2285
01:39:20.601 --> 01:39:22.400
<v Speaker 5>I know you have a great conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them.</v>

2286
01:39:22.401 --> 01:39:23.210
<v Speaker 5>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

2287
01:39:23.211 --> 01:39:25.430
<v Speaker 5>he's a sweetheart of a guy or he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>creeped out.</v>

2288
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:27.350
<v Speaker 5>Like I have creeped out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>celebrities before.</v>

2289
01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:31.460
<v Speaker 5>I think he would deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's very intelligent.</v>

2290
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:34.280
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'll start to say how good dude,</v>

2291
01:39:34.281 --> 01:39:36.230
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a really good dude and he struggled</v>

2292
01:39:36.231 --> 01:39:39.890
<v Speaker 5>with that fucking demon in a bottle to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you saying,</v>

2293
01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:40.940
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

2294
01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember who you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>

2295
01:39:42.681 --> 01:39:47.681
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said Phil Hartman is so talented and </v>

2296
01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.930
<v Speaker 5>he was taken away so quick that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't know you were getting to work </v>

2297
01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:51.920
<v Speaker 5>with like a fuck a guy that's a legend </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of his life.</v>

2298
01:39:51.921 --> 01:39:56.921
<v Speaker 5>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we certainly didn't know it was the end </v>

2299
01:39:56.921 --> 01:39:58.391
<v Speaker 5>of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we definitely knew he was something </v>

2300
01:39:58.391 --> 01:39:58.391
<v Speaker 5>special.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2301
01:39:58.391 --> 01:39:58.391
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time we went anywhere,</v>

2302
01:39:58.391 --> 01:40:01.580
<v Speaker 5>like that's where the people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't want her to talk to Phil,</v>

2303
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.920
<v Speaker 5>like very rarely anybody wanted to talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>to me.</v>

2304
01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.560
<v Speaker 5>Like if they did interviews and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

2305
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:08.450
<v Speaker 5>I may occasionally people want her to </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to me,</v>

2306
01:40:08.630 --> 01:40:11.000
<v Speaker 5>but most of the time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to talk to Phil.</v>

2307
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:14.180
<v Speaker 5>It was Phil fucking Hartman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was always doing big movies,</v>

2308
01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:19.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he had that Sergeant Bilko movie </v>

2309
01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.641
<v Speaker 5>that turn out to be like a bomb that </v>
<v Speaker 5>while we're all together and he did </v>

2310
01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:21.641
<v Speaker 5>another couple of movies while we're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2311
01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:24.230
<v Speaker 5>He was always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was always kicking ass.</v>

2312
01:40:24.231 --> 01:40:26.080
<v Speaker 5>He was always doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was He in Beethoven?</v>

2313
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:29.420
<v Speaker 5>I think he was the dad in Beethoven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like the third house.</v>

2314
01:40:29.421 --> 01:40:31.510
<v Speaker 5>I think it was in the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2315
01:40:31.511 --> 01:40:33.770
<v Speaker 5>There's those Groden who became a talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>show host.</v>

2316
01:40:33.771 --> 01:40:38.771
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Charles Grodin was in the first one and </v>

2317
01:40:38.771 --> 01:40:38.870
<v Speaker 5>I think down the line he got weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I got weird.</v>

2318
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:41.330
<v Speaker 5>I think he just got implants or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2319
01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.320
<v Speaker 5>I think I just saw him with hair really </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

2320
01:40:45.321 --> 01:40:47.840
<v Speaker 5>He had wigs forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's how I'm thinking of.</v>

2321
01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:52.841
<v Speaker 5>He might have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He might have done it all up and then </v>

2322
01:40:52.841 --> 01:40:52.841
<v Speaker 5>release the hounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He seemed like an interesting guy.</v>

2323
01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:58.170
<v Speaker 5>He seemed like an interesting guy when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a comic and I think you'd fall off </v>

2324
01:40:58.170 --> 01:41:00.391
<v Speaker 5>the deep end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dudes get older and they just get tired </v>

2325
01:41:00.391 --> 01:41:04.111
<v Speaker 5>of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy was around the 70s by the time </v>

2326
01:41:04.111 --> 01:41:05.150
<v Speaker 5>you know the year 2015 rolls around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's probably like,</v>

2327
01:41:05.151 --> 01:41:06.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2328
01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be me.</v>

2329
01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:09.230
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2330
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.460
<v Speaker 5>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joan Rivers it burn out.</v>

2331
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.420
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking.</v>

2332
01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:15.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been thinking about this lately.</v>

2333
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you'd die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think you die?</v>

2334
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good luck with that idea.</v>

2335
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:26.310
<v Speaker 5>You probe it theoretically.</v>

2336
01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.430
<v Speaker 5>I guess it just ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like there's.</v>

2337
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel like you keep keep going </v>
<v Speaker 5>into new parallel universes.</v>

2338
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 5>It's just as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of could have done a lot.</v>

2339
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:39.100
<v Speaker 5>You buy half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2340
01:41:39.101 --> 01:41:39.530
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2341
01:41:39.531 --> 01:41:42.280
<v Speaker 5>I might have died a million people die </v>
<v Speaker 5>around you.</v>

2342
01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:43.390
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that about?</v>

2343
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:48.990
<v Speaker 5>I think that's part of my university,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not part of theirs and my own </v>

2344
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:52.741
<v Speaker 5>parallel universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They die and that is for my journey for </v>

2345
01:41:52.741 --> 01:41:52.860
<v Speaker 5>them to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember last year,</v>

2346
01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.670
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we lost a bunch of guys.</v>

2347
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I've lost a ton of friends from suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

2348
01:41:57.191 --> 01:41:59.650
<v Speaker 5>Oh well hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's not even get into it.</v>

2349
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 5>We lost like foreign college and our </v>
<v Speaker 5>fraternity.</v>

2350
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:06.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three and three.</v>

2351
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:08.860
<v Speaker 5>Your friends in high school committed </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide?</v>

2352
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah,</v>

2353
01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.130
<v Speaker 5>we lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We lost somebody in our,</v>

2354
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:16.850
<v Speaker 5>in our fraternity that at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2355
01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:17.560
<v Speaker 5>the therapist came in.</v>

2356
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.560
<v Speaker 5>It's like you guys may not be being good</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends to each other because you guys </v>

2357
01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.490
<v Speaker 5>are killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like one or two year span,</v>

2358
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.710
<v Speaker 5>the therapist blamed this on a therapist</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about,</v>

2359
01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.170
<v Speaker 5>to explain loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at a certain point,</v>

2360
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:37.470
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the second suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think by two years for suicides,</v>

2361
01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.980
<v Speaker 5>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three years maybe.</v>

2362
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So more than one a year.</v>

2363
01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 5>We had one in the spring and one in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>summer.</v>

2364
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:46.870
<v Speaker 5>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then we,</v>

2365
01:42:46.871 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so we brought a therapist in because</v>

2366
01:42:49.301 --> 01:42:50.450
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

2367
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:55.510
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there something going on in this </v>

2368
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.510
<v Speaker 5>room?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're all killing ourselves.</v>

2369
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Did a lot sexier than just a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking homophobic.</v>

2370
01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:02.570
<v Speaker 5>Dick's alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>homophobic,</v>

2371
01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.100
<v Speaker 5>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>

2372
01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 5>And then we blow their brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drug problems.</v>

2373
01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.300
<v Speaker 5>Had no barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How are these guys?</v>

2374
01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Iceland themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2375
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.220
<v Speaker 5>but two guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one drugs when hanging.</v>

2376
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:18.580
<v Speaker 5>There was a dude who was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>writers on news radio was a good friend.</v>

2377
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 5>He's a really good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really enjoyed talking to him.</v>

2378
01:43:21.011 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 5>He was a comic before the news radio </v>
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

2379
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:24.550
<v Speaker 5>His name is drake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say either.</v>

2380
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:27.400
<v Speaker 5>It was a funny comic he'd been on and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know that name.</v>

2381
01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.370
<v Speaker 5>He was a writer on news radio and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote this thing,</v>

2382
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:35.350
<v Speaker 5>if you ever see that video of me is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>the vh one fashion awards from 1997.</v>

2383
01:43:35.351 --> 01:43:40.351
<v Speaker 5>I played this crazy photographer that </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't know anything about photography </v>

2384
01:43:40.351 --> 01:43:42.290
<v Speaker 5>photography to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He show your bike.</v>

2385
01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:48.050
<v Speaker 5>I was naked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was naked in front of this model like </v>

2386
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.050
<v Speaker 5>a I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question was,</v>

2387

<v Speaker 5>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing stand up and he had a family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>propecia,</v>

2437
01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fall out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize until I got off of it,</v>

2446
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I ran out of it and also my Dick was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard as a rock.</v>

2447

<v Speaker 1>soon as I got off Rogaine to decided to </v>

2451

<v Speaker 1>I am going to have to abandon this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dam and run from the river </v>

2454
01:46:48.311 --> 01:46:49.040
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't hold it back anymore like this,</v>

<v Speaker 5>head and I had the exact same hair loss </v>

2462
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.830
<v Speaker 5>when I met you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You both use the sprinkle stuff and the,</v>

2463
01:47:10.831 --> 01:47:11.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

2464
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 5>propecia and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2465
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:15.210
<v Speaker 5>what's the other stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2466
01:47:15.211 --> 01:47:17.760
<v Speaker 5>I found this stuff that you get online </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was this,</v>

2467
01:47:17.761 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this a pump that was,</v>

2468
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:25.970
<v Speaker 5>it was like as lead acid and retin a and</v>
<v Speaker 5>minoxidil and this company had the shit.</v>

2469
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:32.871
<v Speaker 5>This was the shit stuff kept your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for whatever reason it wasn't </v>

2470
01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:37.941
<v Speaker 5>approved by the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the FDA came along and they shut them</v>

2471
01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:43.251
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like I knew a bunch of dudes that </v>

2472
01:47:43.251 --> 01:47:43.251
<v Speaker 5>were taking this stuff.</v>

2473
01:47:43.251 --> 01:47:43.980
<v Speaker 5>It had retina and it would make your </v>
<v Speaker 5>hair red,</v>

2474
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.770
<v Speaker 5>like your scalp read if you spray too </v>
<v Speaker 5>much of it in.</v>

2475
01:47:46.771 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 5>But the effect was pretty dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it really kept all of your hair and</v>

2476
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.880
<v Speaker 5>when that stuff went away I took a hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I got off probation I took a big </v>

2477
01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 5>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see like if you watch like </v>

2478
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.550
<v Speaker 5>episodes of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could see like we started seeing </v>

2479
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:05.790
<v Speaker 5>hair like light through my hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's going baby.</v>

2480
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000
<v Speaker 5>And then finally I had to let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I should've let it go a long time </v>

2481
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.000
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love having a shaved head.</v>

2482
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.720
<v Speaker 5>It's foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do it right now.</v>

2483
01:48:12.721 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 5>So hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe.</v>

2484
01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:13.720
<v Speaker 5>Hope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>my head for a million.</v>

2488
01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 5>Like you're holding them hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.640
<v Speaker 5>I'll do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that old time lapse?</v>

2490
01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Stop using Rogaine and just watch my </v>
<v Speaker 5>hair fall out.</v>

2491
01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.860
<v Speaker 5>And then you said all these young kids </v>
<v Speaker 5>who you want to keep your hair get on </v>

2492
01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.081

<v Speaker 5>I should arguably be bald as fuck right </v>

2493

<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been holding on his hair just with </v>

2494
01:48:44.301 --> 01:48:44.520
<v Speaker 5>the Rogaine my entire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since I was 22 I said this weekend,</v>

2495
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:49.521
<v Speaker 5>tell me if you agree with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a little bit of a stretch with </v>

2496
01:48:49.521 --> 01:48:52.251
<v Speaker 5>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men who lose their hair at a young age </v>

2497
01:48:52.251 --> 01:48:54.020
<v Speaker 5>that you start losing your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the first record.</v>

2498
01:48:54.250 --> 01:48:56.760
<v Speaker 5>The first signpost for mortality in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

2499
01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.540
<v Speaker 5>Like you witnessed your mortality at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>young age when you realize,</v>

2500
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually losing my hair.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Mortality.</v>

2502
01:49:03.721 --> 01:49:07.660
<v Speaker 5>To me it seemed more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you couldn't control something like</v>

2503
01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:12.670
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>like going away from you and it's </v>

2504
01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:12.670
<v Speaker 5>something that makes you look better.</v>

2505
01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 5>It was really confusing for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

2506
01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 5>It's very confusing and it freaked me </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2507
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just shave your head.</v>

2508
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:22.570
<v Speaker 5>That's the beautiful thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the solution of shaving your head </v>

2509
01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:22.570
<v Speaker 5>is always there and once you do it you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2510
01:49:22.570 --> 01:49:23.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why am I.</v>

2511
01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:28.971
<v Speaker 5>What am I going to here for?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I may shave it and then stay on Rogaine </v>

2512
01:49:28.971 --> 01:49:33.101
<v Speaker 5>or wish I shaved it when I was in my </v>
<v Speaker 5>twenties instead of going through hair </v>

2513
01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:33.101
<v Speaker 5>transplants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that stupid shit.</v>

2514
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 5>I have just shaved it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely do that again.</v>

2515
01:49:36.421 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 5>IfW ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I went back,</v>

2516
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:39.330
<v Speaker 5>I would definitely do that differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2517
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:41.760
<v Speaker 5>If they said that there was a pill that </v>
<v Speaker 5>could grow a full,</v>

2518
01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 5>a full 18 year old head of hair for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want any more here.</v>

2519
01:49:45.451 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:49:46.711 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Like now I will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fuck</v>

2521
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 1>knows what else that pill's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

2522
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Like if I just shaved my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fairly happy with it.</v>

2523
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be born in Ethiopia,</v>

2524
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have been an Eskimo.</v>

2525
01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Not there's anything wrong.</v>

2526
01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:04.580
<v Speaker 6>All due respect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really think you're supposed to say </v>

2527
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:10.260
<v Speaker 6>this shit out in an Igloo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some guy trying to get a walrus.</v>

2528
01:50:13.351 --> 01:50:18.351
<v Speaker 6>Vagina fence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>PILBARA had red hair.</v>

2529
01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things it could've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>way worse,</v>

2530
01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:24.710
<v Speaker 1>but like kind of deal with the hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been given.</v>

2531
01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You ain't going to change it and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hand and fucking run with it man.</v>

2532
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.740
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the hand looks just </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

2533
01:50:30.741 --> 01:50:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to fucking tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2534
01:50:33.951 --> 01:50:34.900
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got A.</v>

2535
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I got a two and a three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2536
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:39.440
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hands dog shit.</v>

2537
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you're going down the street to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was a soap opera.</v>

2538
01:50:42.021 --> 01:50:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Fabio looking motherfucker with the long</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

2539
01:50:43.941 --> 01:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy's got all the fucking car </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut 52 deck card.</v>

2540
01:50:48.831 --> 01:50:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I got two cards is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use that.</v>

2541
01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And people sometimes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that guy's got fucking everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized I got fucking nothing.</v>

2543
01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2544
01:50:57.351 --> 01:50:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like the thing about human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2545
01:50:59.421 --> 01:50:59.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2546
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.250
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you?</v>

2547
01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:05.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not just how you look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is with a lot of people,</v>

2548
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you gauge how you look based on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually desirable you are.</v>

2549
01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the real issue with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it with a lot of people as they </v>

2550
01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.711
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start freaking out and there's </v>

<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

2553
01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>He's got fake hair and fake lips in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2554
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Something's going on with his face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2555
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.490

<v Speaker 1>Does he know he's Mickey Rourke?</v>

2557

<v Speaker 1>Does he think it looks amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was mad at this.</v>

2558
01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I would love to drink with Mickey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rourke.</v>

2559
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:41.770
<v Speaker 1>She's just crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing about old boxing stories for the</v>

2560
01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.210
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of our two,</v>

2561
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:47.210
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting fake boxing matches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see he called.</v>

2562
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:49.260

<v Speaker 1>He thought some kind of boxing.</v>

2563
01:51:49.261 --> 01:51:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's total dive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy never punched him in the face.</v>

2564
01:51:52.041 --> 01:51:57.041
<v Speaker 1>Once he hit the guy with a weak punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that body and the guy went down like he </v>

2565
01:51:57.041 --> 01:51:57.260
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone stole his liver.</v>

2566
01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so dumb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's so pathetic like you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy from nine and a half </v>

<v Speaker 1>don't like that you'd like to change </v>

<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for bonds,</v>

2572
01:52:12.521 --> 01:52:16.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deal with all the prospective deal </v>

2573
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:17.090
<v Speaker 1>with the perspective of who you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to who you could've been born</v>

2574
01:52:17.091 --> 01:52:21.890
<v Speaker 1>in Ethiopia with no feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your renewals to off the top of them are</v>

2575
01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:26.930
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The corn weird right here was just </v>

2576
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.930
<v Speaker 1>smooth that out to be good.</v>

2577
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can start tweaking it by other </v>

2578
01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.411
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that get their shins </v>

2579
01:52:32.411 --> 01:52:34.250
<v Speaker 1>broken and separated slowly with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices that make them inches taller.</v>

2580
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:36.380
<v Speaker 1>In China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

2581
01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys in China that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like they can't get a woman because</v>

2582
01:52:39.381 --> 01:52:44.381
<v Speaker 1>they're below five feet tall and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is slowly but surely stretching </v>

2583
01:52:44.381 --> 01:52:48.461
<v Speaker 1>the fucking bones of their legs have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bolts that are attached to their </v>

2584
01:52:48.461 --> 01:52:51.110
<v Speaker 1>bone and they crank it and they slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

2585
01:52:51.111 --> 01:52:56.111
<v Speaker 1>They saw it and then they slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated so it grows a little bit and </v>

2586
01:52:56.111 --> 01:53:00.281
<v Speaker 1>then they separate it more and it grows </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit and they separate it more </v>

2587
01:53:00.281 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 1>and the bone keeps filling in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking madness.</v>

2588
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 1>The mechanics of your body are all out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of whack because you've got a seven foot</v>

2589
01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>long shinbone like the whole thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>

2590
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:11.960
<v Speaker 1>People are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think health and well being is good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he got also have perspective.</v>

2592
01:53:15.771 --> 01:53:20.771
<v Speaker 1>Perspective is big and sometimes people </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get mad because they don't </v>

2593
01:53:20.771 --> 01:53:23.630
<v Speaker 1>look like Lorenzo Lamas in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad because they're boring.</v>

2594

<v Speaker 1>Portuguese.</v>

<v Speaker 1>People have weird things in their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they they,</v>

2598
01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:39.540
<v Speaker 1>they want to be something other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are and right now that's </v>

2599
01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:39.540
<v Speaker 1>unavailable.</v>

01:54:29.070 --> 01:54:33.060
<v Speaker 1>that was legendary up until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they haven't even disclosed its </v>

2618
01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.631
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they brought back artifacts like </v>

2619
01:54:36.631 --> 01:54:38.341
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker's real like we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>found a hidden city in Honduras from a </v>

2620
01:54:38.741 --> 01:54:42.280
<v Speaker 1>long time ago where it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing but relics and shit.</v>

2621
01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's so fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool that they.</v>

2622
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:49.750
<v Speaker 1>They keep finding shit like that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon too.</v>

2623
01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 1>They have these satellite images and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go away.</v>

2624
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:53.950
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shape of this.</v>

2625
01:54:53.951 --> 01:54:56.020
<v Speaker 1>This is symmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they realize like,</v>

2626
01:54:56.021 --> 01:54:57.190
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a canal system.</v>

2627
01:54:57.191 --> 01:54:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fake.</v>

2628
01:54:58.810 --> 01:55:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So fucking city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got swallowed by the jungle.</v>

2629
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.640
<v Speaker 1>They have hills that they thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a hill and they realize it's a </v>

2630
01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:09.631
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some structure underneath </v>

2631
01:55:09.631 --> 01:55:11.821
<v Speaker 1>this hill and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dirt literally grew over it and </v>

2632
01:55:11.821 --> 01:55:11.821
<v Speaker 1>trees grew on the dirt.</v>

2633
01:55:11.821 --> 01:55:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So there's this mound in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and you walk up to it.</v>

2634
01:55:14.331 --> 01:55:15.250
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

2635
01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And archeologists start digging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they go,</v>

2636
01:55:17.201 --> 01:55:18.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking building man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a type of,</v>

2639
01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called a total tax that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even exactly know what they </v>

2640
01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:29.800
<v Speaker 1>looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know where they came from.</v>

2641
01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:34.920
<v Speaker 1>They had very African looking faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they live something thousands and </v>

2642
01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:39.340
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago down in Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 1>and South America and like were like,</v>

2645
01:55:44.341 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those toll tag cans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>

2647
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:53.960
<v Speaker 1>They find these enormous blocks of stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are cut out to the shape of these.</v>

2648

<v Speaker 1>I think there's no one over there.</v>

2650
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist in the world of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel channel.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I might have made up that weight,</v>

2659
01:56:36.630 --> 01:56:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but look what they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking cool as shit that looks </v>

2660
01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:41.700
<v Speaker 1>like an African.</v>

01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:49.950
<v Speaker 1>they're all different sizes and shapes.</v>

2665
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:51.990
<v Speaker 8>Joe,</v>

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
<v Speaker 8>I saw you tweet you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You just didn't even get into the whole </v>

2667
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:57.850
<v Speaker 8>dress thing that happened the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The way cold blue,</v>

2668
01:56:57.851 --> 01:57:00.090
<v Speaker 8>black thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't give a fuck about dresses.</v>

2669
01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:00.420
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2670
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:03.490
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But do you understand what happened?</v>

2671
01:57:03.491 --> 01:57:04.600
<v Speaker 8>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's grown,</v>

2672
01:57:04.601 --> 01:57:05.830
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't you think that's interesting?</v>

2673
01:57:05.831 --> 01:57:08.020
<v Speaker 8>We could both look at the same picture </v>
<v Speaker 8>and see two different colors,</v>

2674
01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.120
<v Speaker 8>but why is that a explained as the run?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Supposedly it's the cones and people's </v>

2675
01:57:13.361 --> 01:57:14.120
<v Speaker 8>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like my,</v>

2676
01:57:14.150 --> 01:57:19.150
<v Speaker 8>my eyes are more open circles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what the eye doctor used to </v>

2677
01:57:19.150 --> 01:57:19.180
<v Speaker 8>always tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was like,</v>

2678
01:57:19.181 --> 01:57:24.181
<v Speaker 8>you have more of an eye was going by,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's,</v>

2679
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:30.270
<v Speaker 8>I guess how the shape of your cones and </v>
<v Speaker 8>how you get light,</v>

2680
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 8>but how come it looks?</v>

2681
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's different to different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes it looks different to the</v>

2682
01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.430
<v Speaker 1>same person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get one image,</v>

2683
01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:40.750
<v Speaker 8>golden cross blue,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mine will look like white and gold,</v>

2684
01:57:40.751 --> 01:57:42.610
<v Speaker 8>and then like an hour later I look at it</v>
<v Speaker 8>and be like,</v>

2685
01:57:42.670 --> 01:57:44.620
<v Speaker 8>it's a completely different picture and </v>
<v Speaker 8>I would freak out.</v>

2686
01:57:44.621 --> 01:57:49.621
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where's the picture I was just looking </v>

2687
01:57:49.621 --> 01:57:49.621
<v Speaker 8>at?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

2688
01:57:49.621 --> 01:57:51.601
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I can switch back and forth where I </v>

2689
01:57:51.601 --> 01:57:52.300
<v Speaker 8>know people that can't switch or people </v>
<v Speaker 8>that only see blue and black,</v>

2690
01:57:52.301 --> 01:57:52.780
<v Speaker 8>white or gold.</v>

2691
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:58.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing compared to what Phil </v>

<v Speaker 8>Jamie,</v>

2732
01:59:40.251 --> 01:59:41.810
<v Speaker 8>you're completely missing the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

2733
01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.870
<v Speaker 8>The actual dress was blue and black.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I actually have it on my phone.</v>

2734
01:59:44.871 --> 01:59:46.770
<v Speaker 8>This is what you're seeing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This,</v>

2735
01:59:47.710 --> 01:59:51.290
<v Speaker 8>this is not what you stumble.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's getting very.</v>

2736
01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:55.430
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is not what I see right now either.</v>

2737
01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:57.960
<v Speaker 8>But this is what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a,</v>

2738
01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:00.590
<v Speaker 8>the act that was the actual dress that </v>
<v Speaker 8>they have.</v>

2739
02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:02.510
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but th,</v>

2740
02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:02.960
<v Speaker 8>th,</v>
<v Speaker 8>th.</v>

2741
02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a light blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so very,</v>

2742
02:00:07.671 --> 02:00:12.671
<v Speaker 1>very light blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no point in the gold is </v>

2743
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the black is like a gold for sure.</v>

2744
02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2745
02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>that does not look black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2746
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I see white and gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see white and gold right there.</v>

2747
02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not white because if you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the white beside,</v>

2748
02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the reason why he can make out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outline is because beside it is an </v>

2749
02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>absence of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we think of as white.</v>

2750
02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:25.160
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2751
02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.260
<v Speaker 8>Jump.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if you look at that,</v>

2752
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.520
<v Speaker 8>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>

2753
02:00:27.521 --> 02:00:32.521
<v Speaker 8>that's a white and gold dress.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But in a shadow or something like kind </v>

2754
02:00:32.521 --> 02:00:32.521
<v Speaker 8>of annoying.</v>

2755
02:00:32.521 --> 02:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a light blue and a </v>

2756
02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>almost like a brownish gold is dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

2757
02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>So you're seeing white and gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not seeing this.</v>

2758
02:00:38.991 --> 02:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing light blue.</v>

2759
02:00:40.731 --> 02:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing blue and I'm seeing this.</v>

2760
02:00:44.571 --> 02:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Gold is like a like a dark gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a milestone.</v>

2761
02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.130
<v Speaker 8>Mustard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's darker than muster.</v>

2762
02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 8>It's darker than most of you are </v>
<v Speaker 8>actually seeing what people are saying </v>

2763
02:00:58.170 --> 02:00:58.170
<v Speaker 8>as the white and gold.</v>

2764
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2765
02:00:58.911 --> 02:01:03.911
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely blue sky blue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blues.</v>

2766
02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to discipline,</v>

2767
02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.650
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're not seeing this,</v>

2768
02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:13.080
<v Speaker 8>so you actually are seeing what me and </v>
<v Speaker 8>Bert are seeing in Jamie's saying this.</v>

2769
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

2770
02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see this is.</v>

2771
02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:23.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a goofy argument because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast is very different like which </v>

2772
02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:27.191
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The contrast between that color and the </v>

2773
02:01:27.191 --> 02:01:30.581
<v Speaker 1>white behind it is very different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at there that </v>

2774
02:01:30.581 --> 02:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a different image and because </v>

2775
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>it's different image shot in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

2776
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.350
<v Speaker 1>You have a different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2777
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying is though there's two </v>

2778
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 8>different ways people are seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're seeing it,</v>

2779
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 8>the white and what they're saying</v>

2780
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>is the white and gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hundred percent because I could see </v>

2781
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.310
<v Speaker 2>both gets white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2782
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I see both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see white and gold right now.</v>

2783
02:01:45.710 --> 02:01:48.710
<v Speaker 2>See anything other than white and blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you?</v>

2784
02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in the slightest.</v>

2785
02:01:50.331 --> 02:01:55.331
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we cut to the chase and why is it </v>

2786
02:01:55.331 --> 02:01:57.461
<v Speaker 2>that I see this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of the how your eye is </v>

2787
02:01:57.461 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 2>shaped and the cones and how your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>precipitate colors and stuff like that.</v>

2788
02:01:57.921 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>You will can actually wear whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

2789
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proceed.</v>

2790
02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Received a love Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super simple change.</v>

2791
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:19.800
<v Speaker 2>It's just how you're pretty much easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>way as how your eyes take shadows and </v>

2792
02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 2>your brain goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

2793
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:22.850
<v Speaker 2>that shadow is purple or blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can watch.</v>

2794
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>If you look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep it on my phone.</v>

2795
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it like once an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will change throughout the day.</v>

2796
02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Obviously will see what golden should </v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

2797
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:34.010
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing that makes it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

2798
02:02:34.011 --> 02:02:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Show is what else are you seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than that person?</v>

2799
02:02:37.311 --> 02:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Like like if I'm looking at a face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing this face,</v>

2800
02:02:39.921 --> 02:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful and that person's </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing a guy,</v>

2801
02:02:42.110 --> 02:02:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people are color blind,</v>

2802
02:02:44.451 --> 02:02:45.080
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>

2803
02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>that some people don't see certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>colors.</v>

2804
02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:48.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

2805
02:02:48.981 --> 02:02:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind.</v>

2806
02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:53.450
<v Speaker 2>I was on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think socially I see things that other</v>

2807
02:02:53.451 --> 02:02:58.451
<v Speaker 2>people don't see it today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was jogging in the park next to our </v>

2808
02:02:58.451 --> 02:03:02.021
<v Speaker 2>house and these two girls cop pulls up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parks pulls these two girls that are </v>

2809
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:07.091
<v Speaker 2>sitting at the young ladies were sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a park bench to interrogate some of </v>

2810
02:03:07.091 --> 02:03:09.590
<v Speaker 2>the purses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuffs to them and I'm watching this.</v>

2811
02:03:09.591 --> 02:03:14.591
<v Speaker 2>I'm jogging around the park cuffs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and put stars to put them in the </v>

2812
02:03:14.591 --> 02:03:14.591
<v Speaker 2>back of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as he cuffs them,</v>

2813
02:03:14.591 --> 02:03:14.990
<v Speaker 2>they kind of one in first.</v>

2814
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Then the other next and I saw that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two girls clearly in high school,</v>

2815
02:03:20.301 --> 02:03:22.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say 10th grade and 11th </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade,</v>

2816
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that they weren't crying and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that as how sad I saw that as </v>

2817
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>someone needs to step in and fix these </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls because if they've gotten </v>

2818
02:03:33.190 --> 02:03:33.590
<v Speaker 2>handcuffed and thrown in the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and they're not crying,</v>

2819
02:03:33.710 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 2>then there's something wrong with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

2820
02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.880
<v Speaker 2>There's clearly something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These girls need a life lesson changed </v>

2821
02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.830
<v Speaker 2>them because you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you cuffed me in 10th grade,</v>

2822
02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I probably would've started tearing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and freaking out and they just come to </v>

2823
02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:48.140
<v Speaker 2>me and then this guy that was smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>

2824
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:53.141
<v Speaker 2>walking his dog and now I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my head buds out so I'm trying to </v>

2825
02:03:53.141 --> 02:03:53.141
<v Speaker 2>hear what the cop saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're walking right by him.</v>

2826
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:54.650
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how sad,</v>

2827
02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:56.570
<v Speaker 2>how sad I went.</v>

2828
02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2829
02:03:57.690 --> 02:03:59.180
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little girls have a problem,</v>

2830
02:03:59.181 --> 02:04:01.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's so true in the way you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

2831
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.770
<v Speaker 2>like social things you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently tonight.</v>

2832
02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you're brought up or the things that</v>

2833
02:04:08.181 --> 02:04:10.190
<v Speaker 2>have gone through your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the black and blue dress,</v>

2834
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:11.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's.</v>

2835
02:04:11.490 --> 02:04:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Here's the interesting way to show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all looking at the dress the wrong</v>

2836
02:04:15.261 --> 02:04:20.261
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take the picture of the dress on </v>

2837
02:04:20.261 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 2>your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into your preferences and invert your</v>

2838
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:23.990
<v Speaker 2>screens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does is it reverses the colors.</v>

2839
02:04:24.230 --> 02:04:27.230
<v Speaker 2>It stays exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see it white and gold,</v>

2840
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not supposed to stay the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's supposed to change to a </v>

2841
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>different color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2842
02:04:32.871 --> 02:04:34.370
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a trip.</v>

2843
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I made a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2844
02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.320
<v Speaker 2>if you look on my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I it,</v>

2845
02:04:37.321 --> 02:04:38.450
<v Speaker 2>where I reversed</v>

2846
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 8>my colors on my computer and it stays </v>
<v Speaker 8>exactly the same.</v>

2847
02:04:41.041 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 8>If you go to instagram.com/red</v>
<v Speaker 8>band,</v>

2848
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:46.080
<v Speaker 8>fascinating job.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You could pull that out.</v>

2849
02:04:46.110 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 8>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So truth is a weird thing.</v>

2850
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:53.031
<v Speaker 8>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We just guessed that we're seeing the </v>

2851
02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:56.121
<v Speaker 8>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's some dudes that are into </v>

2852
02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:56.520
<v Speaker 8>like really weird checks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know when you go,</v>

2853
02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.060
<v Speaker 8>what does that guy saying?</v>
<v Speaker 8>My,</v>

2854
02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:01.050
<v Speaker 8>my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my overall three on this whole thing now</v>

2855
02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:05.120
<v Speaker 8>is that time travel was created that day</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it,</v>

2856
02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:08.920
<v Speaker 8>that day started off the llamas,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the black and white Lama it.</v>

2857
02:05:09.150 --> 02:05:14.150
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was a police chase in Arizona and </v>

2858
02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:14.490
<v Speaker 8>it was seriously everybody was talking </v>
<v Speaker 8>about on twitter,</v>

2859
02:05:14.491 --> 02:05:19.491
<v Speaker 8>every chance TV channels was on tv and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it was just a police chase of trying to </v>

2860
02:05:19.491 --> 02:05:22.760
<v Speaker 8>capture a black and white Lama and they </v>
<v Speaker 8>ended up capturing the,</v>

2861
02:05:23.150 --> 02:05:25.590
<v Speaker 8>the blue,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the white lama or something like that.</v>

2862
02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.360
<v Speaker 8>The black line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it was like a race thing.</v>

2863
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:32.480
<v Speaker 8>It's type thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is officer all when I say check </v>

2864
02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:33.340
<v Speaker 8>this out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so here's,</v>

2865
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:35.790
<v Speaker 8>here's the dress now a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2866
02:05:35.850 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 8>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's not what I'm talking about,</v>

2867
02:05:38.041 --> 02:05:41.100
<v Speaker 8>but this shows a how it changes colors </v>
<v Speaker 8>if it goes into a shadow.</v>

2868
02:05:41.530 --> 02:05:43.620
<v Speaker 8>A what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2869
02:05:43.621 --> 02:05:45.120
<v Speaker 8>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what I posted.</v>

2870
02:05:45.130 --> 02:05:47.770
<v Speaker 8>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do see that when you pull it back,</v>

2871
02:05:48.170 --> 02:05:53.170
<v Speaker 8>it goes into a shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It changes color because your eyes are </v>

2872
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:53.170
<v Speaker 8>to now going in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2873
02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:57.300
<v Speaker 8>it's the light.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just change colors.</v>

2874
02:05:57.370 --> 02:05:58.370
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2875
02:05:58.390 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 8>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Photographer Jamie explained to us and </v>

2876
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:04.390
<v Speaker 8>absorb light reflects it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this is a,</v>

2877
02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.640
<v Speaker 8>it's like a yellow shitty lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shitty camera and it's bouncing it off </v>

2878
02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.390
<v Speaker 8>and as soon as you move away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the exposure changes,</v>

2879
02:06:12.391 --> 02:06:14.160
<v Speaker 8>the autofocus changes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wait,</v>

2880
02:06:14.161 --> 02:06:15.510
<v Speaker 8>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you went out and bought a dress.</v>

2881
02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 8>Not a lot of things at play here and </v>
<v Speaker 8>people are just ignoring facts.</v>

2882
02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:25.760
<v Speaker 8>I think there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's trolls also playing into this </v>

2883
02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:25.760
<v Speaker 8>white and gold thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What are you talking about,</v>

2884
02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:26.100
<v Speaker 8>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's no talk.</v>

2885
02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:31.050
<v Speaker 8>Let them talk through it the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like for instance,</v>

2886
02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.400
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the black and gold right there.</v>

2887
02:06:32.401 --> 02:06:37.401
<v Speaker 8>Watch it fading away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm holding it like light is now on a </v>

2888
02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:37.401
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not a shadow.</v>

2889
02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:41.600
<v Speaker 8>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know why you're showing this </v>

2890
02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:41.600
<v Speaker 8>video because I'm not even talking about</v>
<v Speaker 8>this.</v>

2891
02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.870
<v Speaker 8>Video has not been the same dress.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hold on dude.</v>

2892
02:06:42.871 --> 02:06:45.720
<v Speaker 8>He's explaining what this effect is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let them talk.</v>

2893
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:51.620
<v Speaker 8>This is my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I suppose I would say what is happening </v>

2894
02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 8>here is I know this is a black and gold </v>
<v Speaker 8>dress,</v>

2895
02:06:52.111 --> 02:06:54.780
<v Speaker 8>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>black and blue dress and what I'm seeing</v>

2896
02:06:54.781 --> 02:06:55.350
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just,</v>

2897
02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:56.490
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to go ahead and say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

2898
02:06:56.491 --> 02:07:01.491
<v Speaker 8>I know that there's also light here </v>
<v Speaker 8>affecting the way I'm seeing the black </v>

2899
02:07:01.491 --> 02:07:05.391
<v Speaker 8>and gold or black and blue dress and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's making other people see gold and </v>

2900
02:07:05.391 --> 02:07:07.800
<v Speaker 8>they're just talking about him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but let him explain.</v>

2901
02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.170
<v Speaker 8>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So why is that?</v>

2902
02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:13.410
<v Speaker 8>I think it's a difference with people </v>
<v Speaker 8>saying what they see and what they know.</v>

2903
02:07:13.411 --> 02:07:18.411
<v Speaker 8>They're seeing like an optical illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like remember the two faces make a vase </v>

2904
02:07:18.411 --> 02:07:20.340
<v Speaker 8>like ic two faces,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but someone else can see a vase.</v>

2905
02:07:20.490 --> 02:07:23.010
<v Speaker 8>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what do you ever seen the blue and black</v>

2906
02:07:23.011 --> 02:07:23.490
<v Speaker 8>love?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2907
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.760
<v Speaker 8>I can see both of them and I also don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>think it matters.</v>

2908
02:07:26.761 --> 02:07:29.040
<v Speaker 8>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is an optical illusion.</v>

2909
02:07:29.390 --> 02:07:30.690
<v Speaker 8>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>here's what I'm talking about.</v>

2910
02:07:30.691 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 8>Here's proof that that we're seeing it </v>
<v Speaker 8>wrong.</v>

2911
02:07:32.431 --> 02:07:35.140
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go to this video where I opened it up in</v>

2912
02:07:35.141 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 8>photoshop and I invert the colors of the</v>
<v Speaker 8>screen.</v>

2913
02:07:38.171 --> 02:07:43.171
<v Speaker 8>When you invert a color to the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it should change right around instagram.</v>

2914
02:07:46.410 --> 02:07:48.230
<v Speaker 8>My twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>twitter.</v>

2915
02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's fascinating,</v>

2916
02:07:50.531 --> 02:07:50.880
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I.</v>

2917
02:07:50.881 --> 02:07:53.110
<v Speaker 8>It's hard for me to believe that that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>the same thing.</v>

2918
02:07:53.111 --> 02:07:58.111
<v Speaker 8>It's weird as it moves away,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's confusing is that I understand </v>

2919
02:07:58.111 --> 02:07:59.770
<v Speaker 8>what moves away and absorbs light to </v>
<v Speaker 8>reflects light,</v>

2920
02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.490
<v Speaker 8>but what am I confused?</v>

2921
02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 8>What is it when I see that one picture,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you see it differently.</v>

2922
02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:07.600
<v Speaker 8>If we change sides.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jamie and the lighting was different.</v>

2923
02:08:07.601 --> 02:08:08.950
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I see it the same way Joe sees it.</v>

2924
02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:11.860
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because you're looking at an image,</v>

2925
02:08:11.861 --> 02:08:13.690
<v Speaker 8>so it's just our cones are shaped </v>
<v Speaker 8>differently,</v>

2926
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:18.810
<v Speaker 8>so I pick up different amount of light </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you seen when that thing started </v>

2927
02:08:18.810 --> 02:08:19.290
<v Speaker 8>out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why don't you say I saw that too.</v>

2928
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.820
<v Speaker 8>I see white and gold saw white gold too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As it pulls away.</v>

2929
02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 8>Do you still see what I see?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Blue,</v>

2930
02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:28.450
<v Speaker 8>blue and black enough as it pulls </v>
<v Speaker 8>closure as they do that again,</v>

2931
02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.600
<v Speaker 8>now I see what you're talking about when</v>
<v Speaker 8>you go to light blue and brown.</v>

2932
02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:33.080
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like mustard.</v>

2933
02:08:33.090 --> 02:08:38.090
<v Speaker 8>Now I see.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a way more radical change than </v>

2934
02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:38.090
<v Speaker 8>the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The other one,</v>

2935
02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:39.140
<v Speaker 8>that other image was like a kind of that</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of.</v>

2936
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:44.270
<v Speaker 8>It's like very light blue like you've.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've always taken pictures before with </v>

2937
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:46.510
<v Speaker 8>like weird lighting on a digital camera </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you're like,</v>

2938
02:08:46.530 --> 02:08:47.270
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was weird.</v>

2939
02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:52.380
<v Speaker 8>This doesn't look like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it really looked like in real life </v>

2940
02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:52.380
<v Speaker 8>because the colors are all off for </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever reason,</v>

2941
02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:57.271
<v Speaker 8>something's too bright like a flash and </v>
<v Speaker 8>this is where I actually take this into </v>

2942
02:08:58.331 --> 02:09:03.331
<v Speaker 8>photoshop and I use this thing called a </v>
<v Speaker 8>color picker where it picks the color </v>

2943
02:09:03.331 --> 02:09:05.920
<v Speaker 8>and it shows you what the color is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what I was clicking on,</v>

2944
02:09:05.921 --> 02:09:08.350
<v Speaker 8>which looked to me immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 8>gold or yellow,</v>

2945
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:11.140
<v Speaker 8>it was doing brown,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dark brown,</v>

2946
02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.810
<v Speaker 8>almost black,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then when I did it to the,</v>

2947
02:09:13.811 --> 02:09:16.300
<v Speaker 8>the what I thought was white,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was doing it to a blue.</v>

2948
02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 8>So then I decided to reverse in all the </v>
<v Speaker 8>screens and the colors and watch how the</v>

2949
02:09:21.161 --> 02:09:23.440
<v Speaker 8>pictures six stay exactly the same.</v>

2950
02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.200
<v Speaker 8>I don't disagree with what you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 8>here,</v>

2951
02:09:26.201 --> 02:09:30.170
<v Speaker 8>but not all the data in there to </v>
<v Speaker 8>compress file.</v>

2952
02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:35.190
<v Speaker 8>It's not real life color,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you reverse colors it will </v>

2953
02:09:35.190 --> 02:09:35.190
<v Speaker 8>change color.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2954
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:36.430
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's see.</v>

2955
02:09:36.431 --> 02:09:39.450
<v Speaker 8>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 8>See what.</v>

2956
02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:41.170
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the same colors.</v>

2957
02:09:41.171 --> 02:09:44.710
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's white and gold right now.</v>

2958
02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:46.810
<v Speaker 8>That's goal kind of a golden white right</v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

2959
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:50.950
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he totally blue and black.</v>

2960
02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:52.760
<v Speaker 8>You see right there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right there,</v>

2961
02:09:52.930 --> 02:09:54.240
<v Speaker 8>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Frozen screen,</v>

2962
02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:57.620
<v Speaker 8>dressed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>different type.</v>

2963
02:09:58.050 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 8>This is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That fucking weird.</v>

2964
02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:01.840
<v Speaker 8>Technically I.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Joe,</v>

2965
02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.420
<v Speaker 8>I think you know that it's black.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you're saying it's black?</v>

2966
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.630
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2967
02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:07.510
<v Speaker 8>I'm seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

2968
02:10:07.511 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 8>the really important one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the really important one is blue.</v>

2969
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:14.970
<v Speaker 8>The blue's undeniable to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>other one that we're calling black </v>

2970
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:18.220
<v Speaker 8>commitment to this class,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not gold.</v>

2971
02:10:18.221 --> 02:10:20.920
<v Speaker 8>It's way darker than gold,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's not black.</v>

2972
02:10:20.921 --> 02:10:23.080
<v Speaker 8>Have like space,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

2973
02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 8>It's more like sort of like a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dark bronze looking sort of a thing,</v>

2974
02:10:27.221 --> 02:10:30.730
<v Speaker 8>but it's not black or gold.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's sort of disingenuous.</v>

2975
02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 8>It's like a creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the only.</v>

2976
02:10:32.741 --> 02:10:34.280
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The only way it could be black</v>

2977
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.710
<v Speaker 5>as if it's blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like super overexposed,</v>

2978
02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:40.980
<v Speaker 5>but if you look at it in a more blurry </v>
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>

2979
02:10:41.010 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 5>somebody like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you like that image of behind you.</v>

2980
02:10:44.331 --> 02:10:49.331
<v Speaker 5>Here's what's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That image behind you on this different </v>

2981
02:10:49.331 --> 02:10:51.881
<v Speaker 5>television look behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over your left shoulder that looks </v>

2982
02:10:51.881 --> 02:10:52.670
<v Speaker 5>different than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That looks way more black.</v>

2983
02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.880
<v Speaker 5>The one behind you on a totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>different television or different </v>

2984
02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:00.460
<v Speaker 5>lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I seen a better tv that's got more </v>

2985
02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:01.960
<v Speaker 5>billions of more colors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it probably has.</v>

2986
02:11:02.970 --> 02:11:06.010
<v Speaker 5>The four K tv,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four K TV does.</v>

2987
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:11.050
<v Speaker 5>This is the one that has the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has more resolution and might not have </v>

2988
02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:11.050
<v Speaker 5>more colors available.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

2989
02:11:11.050 --> 02:11:12.070
<v Speaker 5>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2990
02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:13.540
<v Speaker 5>Four kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lines of resolution.</v>

2991
02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:15.650
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one looks better.</v>

2992
02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:18.230
<v Speaker 5>That looks way better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see on both of them.</v>

2993
02:11:18.231 --> 02:11:20.650
<v Speaker 5>I see white and gold right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see a completely different.</v>

2994
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:21.560
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this.</v>

2995
02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 5>When you're looking at these two </v>
<v Speaker 5>screens,</v>

2996
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:26.330
<v Speaker 5>is one of them look clear to you more on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this one?</v>

2997
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:30.660
<v Speaker 5>This one right here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks brighter and crisper tray,</v>

2998
02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:35.720
<v Speaker 5>so it looks kind of more like dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This looks like we're looking at the </v>

2999
02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:35.780
<v Speaker 5>same dress through fog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where this,</v>

3000
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:39.390
<v Speaker 5>this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A factor that people that just listen,</v>

3001
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:42.620
<v Speaker 5>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to stop it.</v>

3002
02:11:42.621 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to stop it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting because what you're saying I</v>

3003
02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:50.051
<v Speaker 5>think is important because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand it is from the point of view </v>

3004
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:51.600
<v Speaker 5>of someone who understands like </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective photography.</v>

3005
02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:54.560
<v Speaker 5>I've seen this happen multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The photos I've taken,</v>

3006
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 5>I can change through white balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can change the way a whole photo looks</v>

3007
02:11:59.090 --> 02:12:04.090
<v Speaker 5>from green to Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you take a picture of either you can </v>

3008
02:12:04.090 --> 02:12:07.730
<v Speaker 5>make them blend like I see blue and </v>
<v Speaker 5>black that's done that outside,</v>

3009
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:08.530
<v Speaker 5>smoke a cigarette.</v>

3010
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:13.540
<v Speaker 5>I can't deal with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're totally not totally not getting </v>

3011
02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:13.540
<v Speaker 5>the point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

3012
02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:17.480
<v Speaker 5>I were both talking about contrast and </v>
<v Speaker 5>brightness.</v>

3013
02:12:17.481 --> 02:12:22.481
<v Speaker 5>How we can change and make things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look I'm saying is me and Joe are </v>

3014
02:12:22.481 --> 02:12:24.310
<v Speaker 5>looking at the exact same picture and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks exactly different.</v>

3015
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Definitely a fact that seems to be going</v>
<v Speaker 5>on other than what you're talking about.</v>

3016
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:30.680
<v Speaker 5>The thing when you're dealing with two </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally different issues.</v>

3017
02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:33.350
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're dealing with the change of color,</v>

3018
02:12:33.351 --> 02:12:37.580
<v Speaker 5>which was pretty drastic to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched it go from white to gold to blue</v>

3019
02:12:37.581 --> 02:12:38.750
<v Speaker 5>and black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3020
02:12:38.751 --> 02:12:40.310
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really weird.</v>

3021
02:12:40.311 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is really weird,</v>

3022
02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:47.050
<v Speaker 5>but then we're dealing with a frozen </v>
<v Speaker 5>image and in that frozen image we see </v>

3023
02:12:47.050 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 5>different things to different things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that blows me away a little bit.</v>

3024
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:56.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes it yellow cars all of a </v>

3025
02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:56.200
<v Speaker 5>sudden make sense?</v>

3026
02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:57.320
<v Speaker 5>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was looking at yellow car.</v>

3027
02:12:57.321 --> 02:13:02.321
<v Speaker 5>I was like pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know there's a lot of other </v>

3028
02:13:02.321 --> 02:13:04.061
<v Speaker 5>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck do you want a yellow </v>

3029
02:13:04.061 --> 02:13:04.061
<v Speaker 5>corvette?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is ridiculous.</v>

3030
02:13:04.061 --> 02:13:06.020
<v Speaker 5>Mustard colored man now just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3031
02:13:06.021 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 5>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

3032
02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Black?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black is like dope.</v>

3033
02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 5>My heart pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my blood pressure has gone up.</v>

3034
02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:15.880
<v Speaker 5>If you watch the video and brings it </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and it makes you still think that </v>

3035
02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:20.321
<v Speaker 5>time travel was created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That day started off with Obama video.</v>

3036
02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.720
<v Speaker 5>It's just alumni getting away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>beliefs.</v>

3037
02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.240
<v Speaker 5>Cool as the leper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a black one and a white one and </v>

3038
02:13:30.051 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 5>there's people like trying trick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like walking next</v>

3039
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:32.970

<v Speaker 1>Whether it's like police helicopters,</v>

3042
02:13:37.201 --> 02:13:39.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try not to kill it.</v>

3043
02:13:39.571 --> 02:13:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>llamas.</v>

3098
02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:30.820
<v Speaker 1>They take them into like a cargo van.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They load them up in the back of the van</v>

3099
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and they bring them to like Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they pull them out of the van and these </v>

3100
02:16:35.970 --> 02:16:37.900
<v Speaker 1>things are hardy as fuck and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can just carry shit.</v>

3101
02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get cold.</v>

3102
02:16:39.821 --> 02:16:41.920
<v Speaker 1>They just stand out there in the snow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like whatever.</v>

3103
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't bother them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their body temperature is way higher </v>

3104
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:49.651
<v Speaker 1>than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their way sturdier than ours and they </v>

3105
02:16:49.651 --> 02:16:49.651
<v Speaker 1>use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The packout meat.</v>

3106
02:16:49.651 --> 02:16:52.981
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a whole show about it and his </v>

3107
02:16:52.981 --> 02:16:52.981
<v Speaker 1>show about like these llamas going with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out in.</v>

3108
02:16:52.981 --> 02:16:57.731
<v Speaker 1>They're like getting an elk and packing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the back of these fucking llamas </v>

3109
02:16:57.731 --> 02:16:59.420
<v Speaker 1>and traveling out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the woods with them.</v>

3110
02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apparently he had a moose once and in</v>

3111
02:17:04.991 --> 02:17:07.830
<v Speaker 1>carrying the Moose back to his car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like over and over again.</v>

3112
02:17:07.831 --> 02:17:11.560
<v Speaker 1>And all these trips he fucked his back </v>
<v Speaker 1>up so he literally couldn't hunt anymore</v>

3113
02:17:11.561 --> 02:17:14.380
<v Speaker 1>because he couldn't carry anything out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had hurt his back so bad.</v>

3114
02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:17.590
<v Speaker 1>So he trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these moves are trained all these.</v>

3115
02:17:17.591 --> 02:17:18.350

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3132
02:17:50.381 --> 02:17:55.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a Texas that has all the </v>

3133
02:17:55.381 --> 02:17:55.381
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a Llama in and uh,</v>

3134
02:17:55.381 --> 02:17:56.260
<v Speaker 1>he has these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at his,</v>

3135
02:17:56.261 --> 02:17:58.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on instagram,</v>

3136
02:17:58.061 --> 02:17:59.120
<v Speaker 1>big cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derek,</v>

3137
02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:01.600
<v Speaker 1>he led his Lama in his house the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3138
02:18:02.210 --> 02:18:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he does this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just does it to film it,</v>

3139
02:18:04.481 --> 02:18:09.481
<v Speaker 1>but the loss is like breaking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through his tablets and throwing </v>

3140
02:18:09.481 --> 02:18:11.530
<v Speaker 1>things and it's just like polaris is his</v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

3141
02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animal man was rude,</v>

3142
02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but they don't give a fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these things in the mountains </v>

3143
02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:22.630
<v Speaker 1>in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's snowing like crazy.</v>

3144
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:27.631
<v Speaker 1>She was just standing there like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a fuck and it makes you </v>

3145
02:18:27.881 --> 02:18:32.470
<v Speaker 1>realize like we're so vulnerable when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the environment that we kind of</v>

3146
02:18:32.471 --> 02:18:37.471
<v Speaker 1>like think of all animals as even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that other animals are more </v>

3147
02:18:37.471 --> 02:18:41.821
<v Speaker 1>harder than us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just don't understand like how could </v>

3148
02:18:41.821 --> 02:18:41.821
<v Speaker 1>they survive this environment?</v>

3149
02:18:41.821 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 1>But how did we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3150
02:18:42.191 --> 02:18:43.860
<v Speaker 1>we figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

3151
02:18:43.890 --> 02:18:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did the first couple of generations.</v>

3152
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>It took awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we could only live in places </v>

3153
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.690
<v Speaker 1>where you can live without any worry of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like heat heating yourself.</v>

3154
02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everything started out in the rain </v>

3155
02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:57.920
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3156
02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all started out in Africa.</v>

3157
02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:02.080
<v Speaker 1>If it all started out in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa is warm as fuck.</v>

3158
02:19:02.081 --> 02:19:07.081
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you have to worry about </v>

3159
02:19:07.081 --> 02:19:08.371
<v Speaker 1>as close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing you have to worry about </v>

3160
02:19:08.371 --> 02:19:10.381
<v Speaker 1>is the abundance of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you have to worry about </v>

3161
02:19:10.381 --> 02:19:10.381
<v Speaker 1>is not becoming food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>

3162
02:19:10.381 --> 02:19:15.241
<v Speaker 1>So it's all about getting to the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees have figured out weapons and it </v>

3163
02:19:15.241 --> 02:19:19.531
<v Speaker 1>starts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a bunch of super horny monkeys </v>

3164
02:19:19.531 --> 02:19:22.590
<v Speaker 1>who fucked like crazy because had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce as much as you can and </v>

3165
02:19:22.590 --> 02:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody fucks everybody so that nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets greedy as far as like a loser </v>

3166
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

3167
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids can suck my dick.</v>

3168
02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like raising everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just trying to keep away </v>

3169
02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:33.941
<v Speaker 1>from Jaguars and fucking leopards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and whatever the hell else is </v>

3170
02:19:33.941 --> 02:19:38.171
<v Speaker 1>trying to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we were forever until we </v>

3171
02:19:38.171 --> 02:19:39.470
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely figured out weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>

3172
02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:42.440
<v Speaker 1>weapons and shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we get think we could fuck it</v>

3173
02:19:42.890 --> 02:19:44.590
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build something from nothing,</v>

3174
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>get in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3175
02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:47.870
<v Speaker 1>how do you want to deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers dude,</v>

3176
02:19:47.871 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3177
02:19:48.951 --> 02:19:52.280
<v Speaker 1>like you pull a stick and it kinda like </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes back to the original shape.</v>

3178
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:57.370
<v Speaker 1>If I tie him fucking string on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bench and then have some shit with like </v>

3179
02:19:57.370 --> 02:19:57.980
<v Speaker 1>a long pointy thing that's sharpen the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

3180
02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I think he can fly I think on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting right at these fucking crazy </v>

3181
02:20:03.010 --> 02:20:07.001

<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure out how to </v>

3182
02:20:07.001 --> 02:20:07.001
<v Speaker 1>dominate these woods.</v>

3183
02:20:07.001 --> 02:20:10.870
<v Speaker 1>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started killing things and they </v>

3184
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:13.151
<v Speaker 1>started using fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to knock rocks </v>

3185
02:20:13.151 --> 02:20:16.361
<v Speaker 1>together to create sparks in the embers </v>
<v Speaker 1>would blow on it like dried moss and </v>

3186
02:20:17.331 --> 02:20:19.700
<v Speaker 1>shit that they had saved for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion.</v>

3187
02:20:19.701 --> 02:20:24.701
<v Speaker 1>They get that little amber crackling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stack would upon it and that keeps </v>

3188
02:20:24.701 --> 02:20:26.180
<v Speaker 1>the animals away from the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't believe they can control the fire.</v>

3189
02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:30.080
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers that fire in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and they slowly figured out how to</v>

3190
02:20:30.081 --> 02:20:35.081
<v Speaker 1>stockpile food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slowly figured out how to make </v>

3191
02:20:35.081 --> 02:20:37.781
<v Speaker 1>walls of community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think like at times like nine 11 </v>

3192
02:20:39.291 --> 02:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>community becomes tighter because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fear.</v>

3193
02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Fear is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think when people were getting </v>

3194
02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 1>eaten and they were a community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think community was tighter or do</v>

3195
02:20:47.031 --> 02:20:49.280
<v Speaker 1>you think there are people that talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit behind people's backs?</v>

3196
02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:53.150
<v Speaker 1>They think the gossipy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really like gossipy type,</v>

3197
02:20:53.151 --> 02:20:55.970
<v Speaker 1>like the way people do it today and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way people like,</v>

3198
02:20:56.450 --> 02:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>especially into celebrity gossip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one theory that I found really </v>

3199
02:21:01.450 --> 02:21:05.141
<v Speaker 1>fascinating was that they think that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has something to do with a lack of </v>

3200
02:21:05.141 --> 02:21:05.540
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone was talking about.</v>

3201
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:11.170
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonding together against an enemy like </v>

3202
02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:14.900
<v Speaker 1>which is what cities used to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cities used to bond together.</v>

3203
02:21:14.901 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 1>They used to have to worry about someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>from outside coming into their meds,</v>

3204
02:21:19.970 --> 02:21:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but now people don't do that anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't really know their </v>

3205
02:21:24.970 --> 02:21:27.761
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not bonded with all the </v>

3206
02:21:27.761 --> 02:21:30.101
<v Speaker 1>people that they live next to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they live next to her almost </v>

3207
02:21:30.101 --> 02:21:32.030
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient and instead of it being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the best people in the world,</v>

3208
02:21:32.031 --> 02:21:34.130
<v Speaker 1>like they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's surrounded together.</v>

3209
02:21:34.350 --> 02:21:36.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just next to Mr.</v>

3210
02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Johnson and he's kind of an asshole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dog shits on your yard and it's </v>

3211
02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:41.320
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3212
02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.250
<v Speaker 1>there's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always some weirdness involved,</v>

3213
02:21:43.251 --> 02:21:45.140
<v Speaker 1>but if there were lions roaming through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the community,</v>

3214
02:21:45.141 --> 02:21:46.250
<v Speaker 1>we'd all be a lot tighter.</v>

3215
02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3216
02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:49.320
<v Speaker 1>If you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to use a title,</v>

3217
02:21:49.380 --> 02:21:52.110
<v Speaker 1>a great idea for a community service </v>
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>

3218
02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:54.790
<v Speaker 1>just released the line one line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3219
02:21:55.340 --> 02:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>probably just going to be somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't realize that lying can fucking </v>

3220
02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:00.770
<v Speaker 1>kill you and they'll be really mad if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill the lion.</v>

3221
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:03.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is people that like they,</v>

3222
02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>they really do choose animals over </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and animals.</v>

3223
02:22:06.921 --> 02:22:11.921
<v Speaker 1>Welfare over people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what we were saying before about </v>

3224
02:22:11.921 --> 02:22:11.921
<v Speaker 1>people working hard to keep the Tigers </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

3225
02:22:11.921 --> 02:22:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe me.</v>

3226
02:22:14.121 --> 02:22:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely joking.</v>

3227
02:22:16.371 --> 02:22:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't want tigers to go extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I lived in India I would be like,</v>

3228
02:22:21.081 --> 02:22:23.420
<v Speaker 1>fuck in Rambo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3229
02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.270
<v Speaker 1>I would make an iron man and I'd get </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fucking wet with tigers.</v>

3230
02:22:27.271 --> 02:22:30.450

<v Speaker 1>I would go when guns.</v>

3231
02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just be wandering through.</v>

3232
02:22:33.871 --> 02:22:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The tall grass is gunning down those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cunty cats.</v>

3233
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Imagine v Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom in front of you.</v>

3234

<v Speaker 1>Your fucking mother.</v>

3235

<v Speaker 1>And dragged her off the top of a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

3236
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:49.070
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this world where you're trying </v>

3237
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:51.180
<v Speaker 1>to save these things that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking metal helmet on.</v>

3238
02:22:51.181 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Like iron man and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All fucking bolted down.</v>

3239
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Just a giant carbon fiber and metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit with machine guns,</v>

3240
02:22:59.810 --> 02:23:03.390
<v Speaker 1>with like a brilliant writer to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a backpack filled with ammo.</v>

3241
02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fuck tigers.</v>

3242
02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I was 10 feet from a lion about a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3243
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:19.360
<v Speaker 2>10 feet from ally in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just watch it does little.</v>

3244
02:23:19.361 --> 02:23:24.361
<v Speaker 2>Just every little movement of an animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so heightened when it could kill you </v>

3245
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:26.170
<v Speaker 2>because it looks at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those be those supporters.</v>

3246
02:23:26.171 --> 02:23:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you open air?</v>

3247
02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Why are they open like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a real.</v>

3248
02:23:30.491 --> 02:23:32.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a real like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's scary.</v>

3249
02:23:32.661 --> 02:23:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I'd look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to be in a van,</v>

3250
02:23:34.330 --> 02:23:39.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's real because you see the will </v>
<v Speaker 2>to beach running next to you and you're </v>

3251
02:23:39.330 --> 02:23:39.580
<v Speaker 2>running right next to them and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the line and you see the hippo.</v>

3252
02:23:39.581 --> 02:23:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Usually the giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see everything out there.</v>

3253
02:23:42.101 --> 02:23:43.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't see gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

3254
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:44.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrong place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

3255
02:23:44.831 --> 02:23:46.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line was 10 feet from us.</v>

3256
02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3257
02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:49.240
<v Speaker 2>for me to that wall right there.</v>

3258
02:23:49.450 --> 02:23:52.240
<v Speaker 2>And I just looked at it and it looks at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3259
02:23:52.270 --> 02:23:57.270
<v Speaker 2>just like a cat just looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flaps its tail tail stares and looks off</v>

3260
02:23:58.570 --> 02:24:00.340
<v Speaker 2>and used to waiting for it to make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one move.</v>

3261
02:24:00.341 --> 02:24:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

3262
02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.080
<v Speaker 2>And then go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fucking over.</v>

3263
02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:05.110
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was well worth.</v>

3264
02:24:05.111 --> 02:24:10.111
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing that timelines for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode to Herbert one time here.</v>

3265
02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:14.200
<v Speaker 2>What'd you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going around going to a room,</v>

3266
02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:17.860
<v Speaker 2>a cage with like for I guess </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretically unruly lions,</v>

3267
02:24:17.950 --> 02:24:22.950
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three to four lions and they call them </v>

<v Speaker 2>This is called your meat stick.</v>

02:24:32.261 --> 02:24:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Don't lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't drop it.</v>

3272
02:24:34.090 --> 02:24:35.710
<v Speaker 2>They respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as you have your meat stick,</v>

3273
02:24:35.711 --> 02:24:39.340
<v Speaker 2>put meat on the meat stick and the lions</v>
<v Speaker 2>will respond to the meat.</v>

3274
02:24:39.450 --> 02:24:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jungle.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but like it's very true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He calls him out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>

<v Speaker 2>his eyes are huge.</v>

3294
02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:31.210
<v Speaker 2>His lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you breathe,</v>

3295
02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:32.980
<v Speaker 2>feel like golf bags were being squeezed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sizing you up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>last one's name was like dog or Reggie,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3306
02:26:01.391 --> 02:26:03.260
<v Speaker 2>when a dog does it and everyone's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they hold their but doesn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's in it.</v>

3308

<v Speaker 2>He put his nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my junk and bent me over,</v>

3309
02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:12.421
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I dropped the meat stick and I'm </v>

3310
02:26:12.421 --> 02:26:12.640
<v Speaker 2>fumbling for my fucking meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was intense as fuck.</v>

3312
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did this thing called the ring of </v>

3313
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:22.251
<v Speaker 2>circle or the tunnel of death where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand the lines up for lions and they </v>

3314
02:26:22.251 --> 02:26:26.850
<v Speaker 2>hang over and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they grow with you as you walk </v>

3315
02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:29.160
<v Speaker 2>through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just like your fucking night.</v>

3316

<v Speaker 2>Now it's your first night in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker.</v>

3317
02:26:32.471 --> 02:26:34.660
<v Speaker 2>And it was broader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking insane.</v>

3318
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for TB.</v>

3319
02:26:37.331 --> 02:26:42.331
<v Speaker 2>So that no one saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scariest thing you've ever had to </v>

3320
02:26:42.331 --> 02:26:42.331
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3321
02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I've done who I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scariest thing was getting mauled by</v>

3322
02:26:46.751 --> 02:26:49.960
<v Speaker 2>the bull probably because I really got </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt and I could've gotten killed.</v>

3323
02:26:50.350 --> 02:26:52.020
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the scariest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3324
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you've seen it hit type in Herbert Rodeo</v>
<v Speaker 2>clown.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3326
02:26:57.150 --> 02:27:00.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we have.</v>

3327
02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was probably the scariest guy </v>

3328
02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:05.660
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

3329
02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:08.880
<v Speaker 2>There is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no like into like a golden egg </v>

3330
02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:12.451
<v Speaker 2>policy in this TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really give a fuck if I get </v>

3331
02:27:12.451 --> 02:27:13.240
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My ribs broke my foot and I was like,</v>

3332
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:15.190
<v Speaker 2>and then I remember getting done and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

3333
02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:17.230
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need more footage.</v>

3334
02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:19.480
<v Speaker 2>This is just me getting bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is perfect.</v>

3335
02:27:20.310 --> 02:27:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So this bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big fucking bull dude.</v>

3336
02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my stuck in a bullpen with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God my foot's broken.</v>

3337
02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to run on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's broken.</v>

3338
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charged you to death.</v>

3339
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely nothing.</v>

3340
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.000
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I realized that's what </v>

3341
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.490
<v Speaker 2>scared me the most about a reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>driven hosts.</v>

3342
02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Reality shows and they needed me that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>had actually shot for about another hour</v>

3343
02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:58.690
<v Speaker 2>of me in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

3344
02:27:58.990 --> 02:28:01.780
<v Speaker 2>in a barrel and it will hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrel because.</v>

3345
02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Because this is back when you had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make tv that was eight minutes,</v>

3346
02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:09.360
<v Speaker 2>like get an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do an eight minute cigarette for five </v>

3347
02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:11.071
<v Speaker 2>minute segment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't feel like they had it just </v>

3348
02:28:11.071 --> 02:28:12.961
<v Speaker 2>a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of fucking producers do you </v>

3349
02:28:12.961 --> 02:28:12.961
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3350
02:28:12.961 --> 02:28:17.251
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same one that maybe I told the </v>

3351
02:28:17.251 --> 02:28:17.251
<v Speaker 2>fighting the bear story on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't happening.</v>

3352
02:28:17.251 --> 02:28:18.370
<v Speaker 2>This is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same producer.</v>

3353
02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

3354
02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Was like reckless with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made me wear makeup.</v>

3355
02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3356
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:31.030
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was probably the scariest thing </v>

3357
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I've done to date.</v>

3358
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously jumping on a plane and Rachel </v>

3359
02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Ray was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3360
02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:34.580
<v Speaker 2>being the first guy to jump off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stratosphere is pretty insane.</v>

3361
02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:37.010
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these rope swings when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these days,</v>

3362
02:28:37.011 --> 02:28:39.420
<v Speaker 2>I showed you the one in Durbin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't want in Switzerland.</v>

3363
02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.990
<v Speaker 2>That was like fucking next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>

3364
02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Fucking horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I began investing big animals,</v>

3365
02:28:47.181 --> 02:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell them to like take it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>50% so that we get the shot.</v>

3366
02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>What did that feel like when that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking slammed into you?</v>

3367
02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he ever been in a car accident</v>

3368
02:28:56.061 --> 02:28:57.530
<v Speaker 2>and you and you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

3369
02:28:57.531 --> 02:28:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3370
02:28:58.250 --> 02:29:00.170
<v Speaker 2>for this fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helpless.</v>

3371
02:29:00.171 --> 02:29:01.460
<v Speaker 2>When it hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

3372
02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I remember it instantly knocking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell out of me.</v>

3373
02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3374
02:29:04.941 --> 02:29:06.020
<v Speaker 2>but there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3375
02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:11.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight or flight fight or flight </v>

3376
02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:13.900
<v Speaker 2>survival instinct where I was and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot was broken and my ribs were broken </v>

3377
02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:14.210
<v Speaker 2>an automatic.</v>

3378
02:29:14.210 --> 02:29:16.130
<v Speaker 2>I just get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I remember the first words,</v>

3379
02:29:16.131 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get out of here?</v>

3380
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:19.610
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like there's no TV in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

3381
02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do I get out of here?</v>

3382
02:29:21.090 --> 02:29:26.090
<v Speaker 2>And they told me the number one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>they said do not go to the walls of the </v>

3383
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:27.560
<v Speaker 2>ring because he pinned you in between </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3384
02:29:27.561 --> 02:29:29.450
<v Speaker 2>he won't let go and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that'll kill you.</v>

3385
02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:31.610
<v Speaker 2>And I went by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3386
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I just went right to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking wall to get out of there because</v>

3387
02:29:34.041 --> 02:29:35.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the middle of the fucking pen,</v>

3388
02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.990
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come back for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to stop me.</v>

3389
02:29:37.991 --> 02:29:41.750
<v Speaker 2>He says Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had no fucking plan to keep you</v>

3390
02:29:41.751 --> 02:29:43.280
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no plan,</v>

3391
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:46.010
<v Speaker 2>no plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

3392
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:49.250
<v Speaker 2>I think fx canceled that knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3393
02:29:49.251 --> 02:29:50.240
<v Speaker 2>we really dodged a bullet.</v>

3394
02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:52.740
<v Speaker 2>This kid could have been killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3395
02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:53.470
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3396
02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:55.710
<v Speaker 2>trust issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I have a hard.</v>

3397
02:29:55.850 --> 02:29:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3398
02:29:56.430 --> 02:30:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds like joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hardcore trust issues with </v>

3399
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:01.430
<v Speaker 2>reality shows should a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3400
02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:04.040
<v Speaker 2>everyone that works on [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquer,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to get the shot.</v>

3403
02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when I say this,</v>

3404
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and I know maybe you've listened to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've been a part of this,</v>

3405

<v Speaker 2>the problem sometimes is going to a </v>

3408
02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>place where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>across the board that you can't drink in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those trucks.</v>

3415
02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:36.200

<v Speaker 2>a hundred 1,530</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour in three seconds and uh,</v>

3444

<v Speaker 2>so you can't move your hands.</v>

3448
02:31:50.730 --> 02:31:55.730
<v Speaker 2>So now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically in handcuffs and </v>

3449
02:31:55.730 --> 02:31:55.730
<v Speaker 2>like a straight jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a helmet on you in a neck brace</v>

3450
02:31:55.730 --> 02:32:00.321
<v Speaker 2>on the helmet around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a titan helmet up and you cannot </v>

<v Speaker 2>very clear.</v>

3453

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>world record like 130 miles an hour in </v>

3455
02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:10.170
<v Speaker 2>three seconds it's going to look pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and you just want to make sure that</v>

3456
02:32:10.171 --> 02:32:13.350
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to make the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making the show better.</v>

3457
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things,</v>

3459
02:32:18.541 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>

<v Speaker 2>always been engaged in safety,</v>

3462
02:32:24.270 --> 02:32:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but that's because I'm an executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>producer and I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>putting yourself in tremendous danger </v>

3467

<v Speaker 2>I wonder what the Fuck's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to exercise it out of your </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful because it's never.</v>

3475
02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Life's never been more defined in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want and what you don't want.</v>

3476
02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:07.950

<v Speaker 6>the doubt because all the years of </v>
<v Speaker 6>loneliness and madness alone,</v>

3525
02:35:50.051 --> 02:35:55.051
<v Speaker 6>beating off on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't understand how inappropriate </v>

3526
02:35:55.051 --> 02:35:55.051
<v Speaker 6>it was and our culture.</v>

3527
02:35:55.051 --> 02:35:58.010
<v Speaker 6>We cannot expect him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the crazy man on the moon to have our,</v>

3528
02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:03.060
<v Speaker 6>our ethics and our look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That guy would be so many miles.</v>

3529
02:36:03.311 --> 02:36:08.311
<v Speaker 6>It's just there's a million of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys in insane asylums all across the </v>

3530
02:36:08.311 --> 02:36:08.311
<v Speaker 6>country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not.</v>

3531
02:36:08.311 --> 02:36:08.311
<v Speaker 6>We don't appreciate them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're in there.</v>

3532
02:36:08.350 --> 02:36:11.500
<v Speaker 6>Then that room got a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that big a deal,</v>

3533
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:15.910
<v Speaker 6>but if that guy is jerking off and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>nurses face on the moon,</v>

3534
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:18.990
<v Speaker 6>it was just him and the nurse on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moon and then you see him.</v>

3535
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.620
<v Speaker 6>He's holding her down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>jerking off in her face,</v>

3536
02:36:20.621 --> 02:36:22.040
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on?</v>

3537
02:36:22.041 --> 02:36:22.840
<v Speaker 6>On the moon?</v>

3538
02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Insane asylum on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like a movie should be.</v>

3539
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:31.100
<v Speaker 5>Should it be rob Zombie's next film.</v>

3540
02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:36.430
<v Speaker 7>Ah.</v>

3541
02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:41.660
<v Speaker 5>Why did you a so much about joe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't dream because you said you </v>

3542
02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:42.750
<v Speaker 5>said two separate occasions.</v>

3543
02:36:43.430 --> 02:36:44.510
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I'm not around.</v>

3544
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:49.060
<v Speaker 6>And then tell me a distorted version is</v>

3545
02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:51.230
<v Speaker 5>you're a old cat still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Josef.</v>

3546
02:36:51.430 --> 02:36:53.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this might be the,</v>

3547
02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:55.760
<v Speaker 5>the week it's a day by day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3548
02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:57.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to let you live one more day.</v>

3549
02:36:57.740 --> 02:36:59.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just getting too bad.</v>

3550
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.110
<v Speaker 5>She's too old in a micro school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3551
02:37:03.111 --> 02:37:05.990
<v Speaker 5>She can't see good anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's 19 now.</v>

3552
02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:07.380
<v Speaker 5>He.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:08.930
<v Speaker 5>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3554
02:37:09.210 --> 02:37:11.540
<v Speaker 5>she can still hop up on the couch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she still does.</v>

3555
02:37:11.541 --> 02:37:13.710
<v Speaker 5>She fall down like my shit falling a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>

3556
02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she falls.</v>

3557
02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:20.050
<v Speaker 5>We used to have her food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was like on this little counter </v>

3558
02:37:20.050 --> 02:37:20.050
<v Speaker 5>area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She would jump up to it,</v>

3559
02:37:20.050 --> 02:37:21.860
<v Speaker 5>but now she's slipped a couple times and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sad,</v>

3560
02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:25.250
<v Speaker 5>sad to watch her slip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When is it the point where you're like,</v>

3561
02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:27.500
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when she's on pain and pain,</v>

3562
02:37:27.501 --> 02:37:29.510
<v Speaker 5>how do we know we're not pain?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3563
02:37:29.511 --> 02:37:31.760
<v Speaker 5>She might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I feel like she's miserable,</v>

3564
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:35.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want her to just slowly die.</v>

3565
02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:37.670
<v Speaker 5>If you could put her asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably more humane.</v>

3566
02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:42.730
<v Speaker 5>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been like looking at her and she </v>

3567
02:37:42.730 --> 02:37:44.501
<v Speaker 5>sleeps about 99% of her life now in </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the same age,</v>

3568
02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:47.750
<v Speaker 5>about 17,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3569
02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:48.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3570
02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:49.790
<v Speaker 5>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3571
02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:52.130
<v Speaker 5>when she does it a way in which he is </v>
<v Speaker 5>awake,</v>

3572
02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:57.340
<v Speaker 5>she's puking a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she can barely pay in the litter box </v>

3573
02:37:57.340 --> 02:37:57.530
<v Speaker 5>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3574
02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:59.810
<v Speaker 5>she's just going right outside of it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

3575
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:02.170
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like if she,</v>

3576
02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:04.760
<v Speaker 5>she in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get dementia.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

3580
02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.040
<v Speaker 5>they meow in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how.</v>

3581
02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:11.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's really bad now.</v>

3582
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My cat,</v>

3583
02:38:12.501 --> 02:38:17.501
<v Speaker 5>she picks up my daughter's shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like my daughter has like these uggs </v>

3584
02:38:17.501 --> 02:38:18.890
<v Speaker 5>soft shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She picks him up and carries them in her</v>

3585
02:38:18.891 --> 02:38:20.960
<v Speaker 5>mouth and while she's carrying them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>her mouth,</v>

3586
02:38:20.961 --> 02:38:25.930
<v Speaker 5>she's going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird politics.</v>

3587
02:38:26.010 --> 02:38:27.830
<v Speaker 5>It's a kitten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what she.</v>

3588
02:38:27.870 --> 02:38:29.350
<v Speaker 5>She never had kittens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3589
02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Maybe she's going mad because she never </v>
<v Speaker 5>had babies.</v>

3590
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:34.040
<v Speaker 5>And here's a question for you.</v>

02:38:34.041 --> 02:38:35.760
<v Speaker 5>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never had to deal with this arc.</v>

3592
02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:37.070
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you?</v>

3593
02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:42.100
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you have to go to shoot or you go to </v>

3594
02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:42.100
<v Speaker 5>the vet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever put asleep a war,</v>

3599
02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:52.580

<v Speaker 5>Because it's so she's going to starve to</v>

3600
02:38:52.581 --> 02:38:57.581
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's like I'm getting my </v>

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:35.940
<v Speaker 5>than yours because she still gets around</v>

3658
02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like a really cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died,</v>

3662
02:41:07.611 --> 02:41:12.611

<v Speaker 1>Somebody slammed into him one day I got </v>

3663
02:41:12.611 --> 02:41:17.571
<v Speaker 1>an email or something about it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been an actual physical mail </v>

3664
02:41:17.571 --> 02:41:21.501
<v Speaker 1>because it was quite awhile ago and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was so bummed out because they cared </v>

3665
02:41:21.501 --> 02:41:25.041
<v Speaker 1>about animals so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been around so many animals that </v>

3666
02:41:25.041 --> 02:41:27.591
<v Speaker 1>had to get put to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when that puppy died and I was </v>

3667
02:41:27.591 --> 02:41:27.750
<v Speaker 1>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started crying too.</v>

3668
02:41:27.751 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a doctor,</v>

3669
02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3670
02:41:31.501 --> 02:41:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it's the hardest part of my job because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I love being able to say.</v>

3671
02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.800
<v Speaker 1>But he had like fucking 15 dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guy who loved animals hit a </v>

3672
02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:40.140
<v Speaker 1>bunch of cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of dogs,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just a sweetheart of a guy man.</v>

3674
02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Sad shit tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody take it easy on the podcast.</v>

3675
02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been fighting that with Chris or </v>

3676
02:41:57.760 --> 02:41:59.711
<v Speaker 2>my dog at home too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's had five knee surgeries.</v>

3677
02:41:59.901 --> 02:42:01.130
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

3678
02:42:01.131 --> 02:42:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Now we're getting the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knee replacement.</v>

3679
02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3680
02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:10.600
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is she purebred purebred into </v>

3681
02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.660
<v Speaker 2>overbred interbreeding and she had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>torn acl and acl.</v>

3682
02:42:14.850 --> 02:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet dog like that.</v>

3683
02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:18.860
<v Speaker 2>She had both are acl replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's had both.</v>

3684
02:42:18.861 --> 02:42:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Are acl done twice and she's had her </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees kneecaps put back in place.</v>

3685
02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Degenerative Degenerative kneecaps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and the one leg,</v>

3686
02:42:27.411 --> 02:42:31.430
<v Speaker 2>her right leg just never really healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went in and we went to therapy and</v>

3687
02:42:31.431 --> 02:42:32.210
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3688
02:42:32.211 --> 02:42:34.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no cartilage in there.</v>

3689
02:42:34.761 --> 02:42:39.761
<v Speaker 2>The only thing was possible was the knee</v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement or we cut the leg off or we </v>

3690
02:42:39.761 --> 02:42:40.790
<v Speaker 2>just leave it as she drags it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3691
02:42:41.090 --> 02:42:42.770
<v Speaker 2>and I was just in the place where I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3692
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to pay so much fucking money </v>

3693
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.070
<v Speaker 2>for this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the fucking new knee.</v>

3694
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you talk to a knee replacement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think there's any light on the </v>

3695
02:42:52.221 --> 02:42:52.790
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

3696
02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:56.420
<v Speaker 2>80%,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80% chance that it's going to be fine.</v>

3697
02:42:56.450 --> 02:42:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I think they put that out of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases of knee replacements,</v>

3698
02:42:59.461 --> 02:43:00.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's only been around for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>of years,</v>

3699
02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:03.270
<v Speaker 2>so they're getting better at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

3700
02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:08.480
<v Speaker 2>but just to be able to give this dog and</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to run and chase play and </v>

3701
02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:10.170
<v Speaker 2>just play other than sit on the couch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

3702
02:43:10.171 --> 02:43:11.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up and get.</v>

3703
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:12.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it gets love</v>

3704
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:12.850
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3705
02:43:13.290 --> 02:43:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen those ones that doing for </v>

3706
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:21.511
<v Speaker 1>people now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they showed there was an animated </v>

3707
02:43:21.511 --> 02:43:23.320
<v Speaker 1>version of the operation online or doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full knee replacement.</v>

3708
02:43:23.350 --> 02:43:26.860
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're watching just going like,</v>

3709
02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:32.380
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soften your knee off and putting this </v>

3710
02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:36.901
<v Speaker 1>new piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new piece of equipment that's like on </v>

3711
02:43:36.901 --> 02:43:37.110
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3712
02:43:37.111 --> 02:43:42.111
<v Speaker 1>a groove and socket sorta set up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching this whole thing that </v>

3713
02:43:42.111 --> 02:43:44.080
<v Speaker 1>screws into place and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>

3714
02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:48.760
<v Speaker 1>We're making bionic knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3715
02:43:49.530 --> 02:43:51.740
<v Speaker 1>But I guess for people that have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3716
02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:54.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge pain relief for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

3717
02:43:54.641 --> 02:43:59.641
<v Speaker 1>some people have degenerative diseases </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their joints and it just gets to the </v>

3718
02:43:59.641 --> 02:43:59.641
<v Speaker 1>point where there's nothing they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about it.</v>

3719
02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:01.540
<v Speaker 1>They're just like rouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3720
02:44:01.541 --> 02:44:02.670

<v Speaker 1>very funny dude.</v>

3725
02:44:09.191 --> 02:44:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And he has a very extreme case of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis,</v>

3726
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:14.170
<v Speaker 1>whereas I guess it's called a rheumatoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis,</v>

3727
02:44:14.171 --> 02:44:17.020
<v Speaker 1>but very extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas his hands and his knees and like</v>

3728
02:44:17.021 --> 02:44:18.200
<v Speaker 1>he's always an agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3729
02:44:18.201 --> 02:44:20.370

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3731
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>So I believe Russell Peters bottle </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

3737
02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:42.310
<v Speaker 1>it's sad when you see shit like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't know what,</v>

3738
02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3739
02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:44.410
<v Speaker 1>could they fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3740
02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:48.610
<v Speaker 1>what's the solution like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a way to improve that,</v>

3741
02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:52.960
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the beautiful thing about medical</v>

3742
02:44:52.961 --> 02:44:57.961
<v Speaker 1>science is that they look at a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and they slowly but surely </v>

3743
02:44:57.961 --> 02:45:00.840
<v Speaker 1>chip away at all the different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix the problem.</v>

3744
02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Like every day they're coming up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these new methods for dealing with </v>

3745
02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:07.930
<v Speaker 1>things that were almost insurmountable </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little while ago.</v>

3746
02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Like they got this doctor in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's replacing people's discs now.</v>

3747
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of quite a few people going </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and I talked to a doctor about it </v>

3748
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and he explained to me that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

3749
02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial discs that they've created in</v>

3750
02:45:23.651 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Germany that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3751
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:27.940
<v Speaker 1>for people that have neck injuries or </v>
<v Speaker 1>back injuries,</v>

3752
02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:30.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they get their discs </v>
<v Speaker 1>fused.</v>

3753
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is they take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>two bones of your desk,</v>

3754
02:45:33.011 --> 02:45:35.770
<v Speaker 1>they remove all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jail that separate.</v>

3755
02:45:35.771 --> 02:45:40.771
<v Speaker 1>So they cut it all away and they put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two bones together and they screw them </v>

3756
02:45:40.771 --> 02:45:43.750
<v Speaker 1>into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you only have the degeneration of</v>

3757
02:45:43.751 --> 02:45:47.780
<v Speaker 1>the disc above it and the disc below it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have one giant fat disks.</v>

3758
02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't move that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just can't go like all the way </v>

3759
02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:52.780
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks with your movement.</v>

3760
02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It fucks with your mobility for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3761
02:45:53.861 --> 02:45:56.980
<v Speaker 1>But for some people that's a significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>like release of pain.</v>

3762
02:45:57.770 --> 02:46:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And so then they came out with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>spacers.</v>

3763
02:46:00.390 --> 02:46:03.400
<v Speaker 1>They had these space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they used in replacement of a desk?</v>

3764
02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the operation they did that Tito Ortiz </v>

3765
02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:11.671
<v Speaker 1>and they explained it on the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They showed like the doctor came and </v>

3766
02:46:11.671 --> 02:46:11.710
<v Speaker 1>showed this space or this plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>spacer.</v>

3767
02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:16.610
<v Speaker 1>But what they figured out now in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like this articulating sort of moving</v>

3768
02:46:16.611 --> 02:46:20.090
<v Speaker 1>joint almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're putting in people's necks.</v>

3769
02:46:20.390 --> 02:46:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I know Braulio esteem got one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3770
02:46:23.151 --> 02:46:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a world famous Jujitsu champion</v>

3771
02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:30.530
<v Speaker 1>who had a significant neck injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his disc replacement,</v>

3772
02:46:30.531 --> 02:46:34.850
<v Speaker 1>artificial disc and talked about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of a benefit it was to him.</v>

3773
02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are getting these discs </v>
<v Speaker 1>like where they were like really fucked </v>

3774
02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:40.380
<v Speaker 1>up before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3775
02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.380
<v Speaker 1>this one guy's a skier and he was fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up before and he's had like two or three</v>

3776
02:46:45.410 --> 02:46:49.430
<v Speaker 1>discs replaced with these artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>disc and now he's like skiing again.</v>

3777
02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It feels great and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

3778
02:46:51.531 --> 02:46:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Like they're putting like robot disks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3779
02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>

3781
02:46:58.270 --> 02:47:00.640

<v Speaker 5>I have no fucking clue.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3785
02:47:06.461 --> 02:47:08.320
<v Speaker 5>I think that might have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

3786
02:47:08.350 --> 02:47:11.980
<v Speaker 5>Fuck there.</v>

02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:17.170
<v Speaker 5>I told you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was worried I was going to deal with </v>

3788

3791
02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:28.260
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the big one happened to him during </v>

3792
02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:30.541
<v Speaker 1>stunt work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing an episode of sons of </v>

<v Speaker 1>and it fucked his neck up like that.</v>

3794
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:36.460
<v Speaker 1>That like really fucked up and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he had to get his dis fused and all</v>
