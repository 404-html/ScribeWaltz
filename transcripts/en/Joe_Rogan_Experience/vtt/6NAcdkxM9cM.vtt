00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed this guy recently talking about animal stuff.</v>

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.561
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>he was doing his phd in University of Pennsylvania and he was working in</v>

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:13.651
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

6
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but there were chimps involved in his research and so they,</v>

7
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>they would come into these cages,</v>

9
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>but they had this big area outside back behind the cages.</v>

10
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:21.931
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

11
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>We're so like at night they would go hang out and there were trees and stuff and</v>

12
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.634
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

13
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>So he would hang out until everybody went home and he was alone.</v>

14
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd sneak back into the area where the chimps were.</v>

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And he told this hilarious story where he's with his champion.</v>

16
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>He'd let go back there and you know,</v>

17
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>smoke a joint at the end of the day.</v>

18
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And the chimps are wondering,</v>

19
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

20
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>And one day this chimp comes over and sits down next to him and he's smoking a</v>

21
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>joint and the chimp reaches,</v>

22
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.873
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>he has not get this champion.</v>

24
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>The joke to the gym.</v>

25
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it just hits it.</v>

27
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It gives it back to,</v>

28
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

29
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.590

30
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>that would be the greatest video ever on youtube.</v>

31

34
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.901
