00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.901
<v Speaker 1>So if you start,</v>

3
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>if you take a guitar string and you split it into four equal parts,</v>

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>you put your finger over a one quarter of the string and then you start just hug</v>

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>plucking the string and hovering above the string so you don't actually push it</v>

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>to the fret board.</v>

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Those notes occur naturally as the harmonics and the expansion of the vibrating</v>

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.394
<v Speaker 1>string.</v>

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>So that those notes were not really chosen by Roy Orbison.</v>

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Whoever wrote the song,</v>

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>they were really chosen by like a four gay series.</v>

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>and it feels like it's a riff,</v>

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but I discovered this when I was in Indonesia as I would start playing that and</v>

15
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>people would react.</v>

16
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I thought like,</v>

17
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.343
<v Speaker 1>why that song?</v>

18
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>What about more complex creative and sort of improvisational song like Voodoo</v>

19
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>child from Hendrix?</v>

20
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know about Voodoo child and</v>

21
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm following along,</v>

22
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>well take taking out and it changes up.</v>

25
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the first couple of cords of red house,</v>

26
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>there's like some seventh or diminished chord.</v>

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Like he's Pegi Nana,</v>

28
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>and then he moves it down a half step,</v>

29
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>which has to do with this tritone substitution and the symmetry inside of the</v>

30
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>seventh chord.</v>

31
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>So if I recall correctly,</v>

32
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 1>you have a chord like c e g B flat would be a c seven chord and the e and the B</v>

33
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>flat would form this thing called a tri tone.</v>

34
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And now if you went in the blues,</v>

35
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

36
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>there are three elements of the chord progression,</v>

37
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the dominant subdominant and the tonic.</v>

38
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>If you go down a half step,</v>

39
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you effectively invert the third and the flat seventh.</v>

40
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>so if you go one half step below that,</v>

42
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the flat seventh and the third I think of the subdominant court.</v>

43
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So Hendricks is actually playing with math in something as basic as,</v>

44
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>do you think he's aware of it or do you think he's doing it sort of just</v>

45
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>instinctual?</v>

46
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.771
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

48
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>when you're visited by an alien intelligence,</v>

49
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>we went through cuddle fish and we,</v>

50
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>now we've gotten the Jimi Hendrix.</v>

51
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

52
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.973
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

53
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>these are the,</v>

54
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>these are the best alien sightings we have.</v>

55
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to speculate,</v>

56
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

57
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.603
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I just look at everything I've been able to understand about what he did and you</v>

59
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:26.521
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

60
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with the supermind as well as an intuitive</v>

61
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>mastery of the instrument.</v>

62
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Complete understanding of the chords and progressions and just the ability to</v>

63
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>improvise and to make it sound different.</v>

64
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Adding the Wah Wah pedal and all that distortion and all this shit that he used</v>

65
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

66
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he imparts more into one note,</v>

67
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>like I wouldn't even know how to notate.</v>

68
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean what does even the instrument and play the guitar,</v>

69
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>he played the guitar amplification,</v>

70
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>signal processing system as a whole.</v>

72
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>there are these people who are just in some multidimensional space.</v>

75
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Another one of my favorites is,</v>

76
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Roy Buchanan who some have these guys who understand the harmonics</v>

78
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>of gravitate to telecasters and um,</v>

79
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.761
<v Speaker 1>pull up song called Roy's blues and watch him just go into the multiverse and</v>

81
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>start playing with things that you can't even imagine are possible.</v>

82
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>So I do think that there is a very close relationship between algorithms and</v>

83
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.214
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

84
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

85
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>

86
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Harvey,</v>

87
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>he was the guy that would give girls the shoulder rubs.</v>

88
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>He would tell them to massage him.</v>

89
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

90
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>he massaged them.</v>

91
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>They would massage him.</v>

92
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>He would do according to these girls.</v>

93
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:47.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's true,</v>

94
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but he'd be the guy that would be,</v>

95
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.113
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.</v>

96
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>And he comes back in a bathrobe.</v>

97
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 2>He's a bathrobe guy.</v>

98
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

99
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to make light of anybody's sexual assault or whatever it was or</v>

100
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 2>harassment,</v>

101
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 2>but other working on the roof.</v>

102
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

103
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>

104
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

105
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.933
<v Speaker 2>but what I,</v>

106
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

107
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 2>How many women said yes,</v>

108
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>that will be a fuck load.</v>

109
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Like that was his move.</v>

110
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>What we're seeing is his missed pitches,</v>

111
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>He hit by a lot of fucking triples and home runs,</v>

113
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 2>knocked a lot of balls out of the park,</v>

114
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally he was wiffen occasionally.</v>

115
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.141
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

116
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I got this one in the bag boys.</v>

117
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

118
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>fuck off you pig.</v>

119
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.131
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

120
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:27.401
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

121
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:27.701
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

122
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>Just come back to my room.</v>

123
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.761
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

124
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:28.871
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

125
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.081
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

126
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like shit down.</v>

127
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 2>What happened Harvey?</v>

128
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

129
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>just wasn't connecting.</v>

130
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.114
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't connecting.</v>

131
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.601
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>

132
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:35.071
<v Speaker 2>I got all this,</v>

133
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>those as a girl wants to be in the next fucking this movie and Avatar 16 and</v>

134
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 2>she's willing to do the thing to get the part.</v>

135
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of like that guys,</v>

136
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 2>they can get the part and get your money and get on with it.</v>

137
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:53.011
<v Speaker 2>How many girls read the story when it broke and could still taste the asparagus,</v>

138
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>caviar flavored come just the cocaine and VOD color in his loads.</v>

139
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I bet he has like a Flemmi like Moan when he comes.</v>

140
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 2>He's a Kinda guy</v>

141
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>spittle and the corners of his,</v>

142
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>now let's try to hit on you.</v>

143
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>He's got a little bit bubble are his lip.</v>

144
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.893
<v Speaker 2>He's nasty.</v>

145
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a gluttonous man control.</v>

146
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not attractive.</v>

147
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.653
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not.</v>

148
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>My favorite too is that he would jerk off into,</v>

149
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.201
<v Speaker 2>did you hear this?</v>

150
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 2>But he plants</v>

151
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>his green.</v>

152
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>He wants to exist off of his loads.</v>

153
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 2>That's such a desperate thing.</v>

154
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Like on,</v>

155
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>can we get it?</v>

156
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.741
<v Speaker 2>Can I have it?</v>

157
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

158
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.311
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

159
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:46.180

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 2>like it's so maybe it was hoping they would just dive in the grade</v>

162
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 2>of a soldier,</v>

163
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.130
<v Speaker 2>but I also like,</v>

164
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.973
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking too,</v>

165
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

166
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I've seen so many dudes jerking off in public like homeless guys.</v>

167
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.850
