<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>one of the only humans that I know that says son more than I do.</v>

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I say sunny.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great today son.</v>

37
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I say by myself when I'm in the car,</v>

38
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>when I see dudes on the phone get off the phone son and they get the phone up to</v>

39
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:17.751
<v Speaker 1>their ear,</v>

40
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>which is illegal under California law.</v>

41
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how many fucking people have died directly as a result of idiots being</v>

42
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:25.221
<v Speaker 1>on their phone.</v>

43
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Texting and driving and talking on the phone with butter ear and losing it.</v>

44
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 1>The peripheral vision.</v>

45
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's staggering numbers.</v>

46
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot worse than I thought it was you at first.</v>

47
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:34.701
<v Speaker 1>I always like,</v>

48
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:34.791
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

49
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.451
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the worst.</v>

50
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like eating or doing other things in the car,</v>

51
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but now there's so many times they're just at the stop light.</v>

52
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Like really stop Facebooking.</v>

53
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a green light.</v>

54
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that just won't let that shit drop.</v>

56
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I have to make up like that.</v>

58
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to send a tweet on the way here.</v>

59
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like on,</v>

60
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you know your winding mountain road almost dying the tweet.</v>

61
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that how they thought that Paris Hilton was a Paris Hilton's plastic</v>

62
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.424
<v Speaker 1>surgeon,</v>

63
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>but it sounded so good.</v>

64
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they ever clarified it.</v>

65
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just leave it out there.</v>

66
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.821
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:05.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>he was all over the cliff and Mallon tweeted about his dog and then a couple</v>

69
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>seconds later died and they were thinking that he was tweeting.</v>

70
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:11.591
<v Speaker 1>While he's driving,</v>

71
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know.</v>

72
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>He could have been reading his tweets.</v>

73
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Know he might not have been actually driving,</v>

74
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but how the fuck do you go off a cliff?</v>

75
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you had written that cliff many a times.</v>

76
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I know Laurel Canyon like the back of my hand,</v>

77
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I can try to call unless you think you're in a goddamn Porsche commercial and</v>

78
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you're going sideways around corners.</v>

79
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 1>There's this video that made me want to get a GT three before it go on is a,</v>

80
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of a Porsche on a mountain road.</v>

81
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a gt three and a mountain road at some bad ass fucking rally driver and</v>

82
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>he's on a mountain road and it's like turning left and right.</v>

83
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>He's going sideways around every corner.</v>

84
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Just knows what the fuck he's doing knows how to handle that thing and it looks</v>

85
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:49.664
<v Speaker 1>so much fun.</v>

86
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.530
<v Speaker 1>You got One?</v>

87
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

88
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I got to gt three.</v>

89
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of that Barracuda.</v>

90
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.633
<v Speaker 1>Well did you?</v>

91
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.981
<v Speaker 1>we can never drove it.</v>

93
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:55.814
<v Speaker 1>Just know for sure.</v>

94
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.331
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I never drove it anyone out for shows the first six months that I add it.</v>

96
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And then it almost killed me.</v>

97
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I talked,</v>

98
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this many times on the show.</v>

99
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So in the interest of brevity,</v>

100
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

101
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>when I got home one day,</v>

102
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the suspension fell off in the driveway,</v>

103
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>the suspension detached from the frame.</v>

104
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.741
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

105
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.251
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

106
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>That could have happened like 10 minutes ago when I was going 70 miles an hour</v>

107
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>on the highway and I'd be a dead person.</v>

108
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>That's like a quarter million dollar.</v>

109
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Well it didn't cost me that much,</v>

111
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably worth that much.</v>

112
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I got rid of it and I'm like,</v>

113
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

114
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.591
<v Speaker 1>I sold it to a dude.</v>

115
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Did I know some rich character?</v>

116
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>You drive it around?</v>

117
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

119
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

120
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>he owns like a big,</v>

121
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.990

123
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 1>He loves cars and he's got an undercarriage to every once in awhile.</v>

124
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

125
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>James like the sandwich,</v>

126
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I pay white pink,</v>

127
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.323
<v Speaker 1>give him a hundred bucks,</v>

128
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>given everybody a hundred bucks to watch it.</v>

129
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the dudes that I gave a hundred bucks,</v>

130
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>now it's one of the cameraman for TMC.</v>

131
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>So he comes down.</v>

132
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.620
<v Speaker 1>He goes down to the Improv and I'm like,</v>

134
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>what's up dude?</v>

135
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

136
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

137
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you remember you used to make me cry in your car for $100.</v>

138
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible impression of him.</v>

139
00:03:59.321 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

140
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

141
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:01.454
<v Speaker 1>That's all he deserve.</v>

142
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Some guys like</v>

143
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>in a bad dude,</v>

144
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just a little on the shy side on the extremely likely,</v>

145
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>like you walked in,</v>

146
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.650

214
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>never got out once.</v>

215
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.601
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one thing.</v>

216
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>He said he's a hell of a cook.</v>

217
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:56.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

218
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I have ever had a spoon.</v>

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.431
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

220
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:58.851
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

221
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>He catered and he brought it to the comedy store and it was really good.</v>

222
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.624
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

223
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to believe he made it.</v>

224
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to be with his fucking stolen from some Mexican dude.</v>

225
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.671
<v Speaker 1>He got some pork.</v>

226
00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I work on a farm for five bucks an hour next time.</v>

227
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those guys in Hollywood,</v>

228
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:16.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

229
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't need a lot of guys that just completely,</v>

230
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>totally full of shit.</v>

231
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>She knows something when you're on their level.</v>

232
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It takes me a while to figure that out.</v>

233
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's an Harvard to figure it out.</v>

234
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.944
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

235
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.811
<v Speaker 1>especially now,</v>

237
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like I have the Internet.</v>

238
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Well now the problem is they've established a long tradition of line throughout</v>

240
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 1>their whole life</v>

241
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and it helps to create this world that they want to live.</v>

242
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.861
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

243
00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot of it is also just impulsive.</v>

244
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.850
<v Speaker 1>The liars that I've known.</v>

245
00:06:44.851 --> 00:06:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they just can't help it.</v>

246
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a hard time not lying.</v>

247
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what's the weirdest is successful liars like or the,</v>

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the few guys that I've ever seen that will get on stage and not have</v>

292
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:11.760
<v Speaker 1>a fucking clue as to what he's going to talk about.</v>

293
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

294
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And he'll stay up there for five hours and he always did.</v>

295
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'd always extract one thing I liked from a comic,</v>

296
00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>even if I didn't like that comic very much as he could pass.</v>

297
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Can think of it as next step is like,</v>

298
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:22.531
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

299
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:22.990
<v Speaker 1>just hang.</v>

300
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I would say yeah,</v>

301
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.150
<v Speaker 1>just face and smoke and stare.</v>

302
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

303
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Speaker 1>also let it seem like you were supposed to be dwelling on the last oh deep shit</v>

304
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>hit you.</v>

305
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Like he just just inundating you with an avalanche of analytics.</v>

306
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

307
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

308
00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:40.770
<v Speaker 1>let me come up from the promote that we're exposed to.</v>

309
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 1>But being comics and by being comics in the pressure cooker that is Hollywood,</v>

310
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you're exposed to psychological lessons at the average person just never gets to</v>

311
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

312
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

313
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:50.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you get to watch someone become crazy,</v>

315
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.903
<v Speaker 1>get to watch someone,</v>

316
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you get to watch someone lose their,</v>

317
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>when they get a little bit of fame.</v>

318
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are fascinating.</v>

319
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>You know the people that get a little development deal and all of a sudden a</v>

320
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>yelling at people and ordering people around.</v>

321
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>And do you know the best story that the story of the Boondock Saints,</v>

322
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:06.811
<v Speaker 1>the kid,</v>

323
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:07.644
<v Speaker 1>the truck up,</v>

324
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.881
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

325
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>we have talked about this on the podcast very recently.</v>

326
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:13.700
<v Speaker 1>This is documentary right there night.</v>

327
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the perfect example.</v>

328
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:16.134
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

329
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Except for the folks that don't know this guy that made the movie,</v>

330
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the Boondock Saints,</v>

331
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and they made a documentary on him called overnight and he's just an</v>

332
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 1>insufferable cunt of a human being who got some success.</v>

333
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

334
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And fucked it all up.</v>

335
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Success though I haven't heard of since then in Hollywood,</v>

336
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

337
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>like they bought the bar,</v>

338
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>the kid worked at,</v>

339
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.920
<v Speaker 1>they didn't come.</v>

340
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>They promised it was part of the deal.</v>

341
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Miramax Harvey Weinstein promise to buy him the bar and then Cole on the bar,</v>

342
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>because that was back then when they had hopes that like,</v>

343
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.291
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

344
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did it.</v>

345
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:44.881
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

346
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:45.860
<v Speaker 1>we're star makers now.</v>

347
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:46.141
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

348
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:46.240
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

349
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take an scripts and make them big.</v>

350
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>That was the added their thing in the mid,</v>

351
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>late nineties Miramax,</v>

352
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>they're huge into that and so I was like,</v>

353
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:52.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

354
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>they can't get that deal.</v>

355
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>And he's talking like people are lining up to make,</v>

356
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that kind of heat around the script since then.</v>

357
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The dudes who were lining up to get in that all Boston Irish dukes were like</v>

358
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>really clamoring to get in there and then it started to whittle down to all you</v>

359
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 1>have is Willem defoe who was in it from the beginning,</v>

360
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but like that's the only guy I think he was stayed at.</v>

361
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Can you see the movie though?</v>

362
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:10.901
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

363
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:11.341
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

364
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing documentary on what,</v>

365
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>what can happen to,</v>

366
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you can add it all.</v>

367
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>You can lose your shit,</v>

369
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

370
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people,</v>

371
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I've met so many people that have just completely lost their shit along the way</v>

372
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

373
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Just mediocre success.</v>

374
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Just a little tiny bit.</v>

375
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 1>When you see them,</v>

376
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:28.501
<v Speaker 1>letting,</v>

378
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:32.060
<v Speaker 1>you know they got $1 million guarantee and there's fucking show they're going to</v>

379
00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:32.881
<v Speaker 1>put it on right after.</v>

380
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Friends are always going to fail.</v>

381
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.513
<v Speaker 1>We're in,</v>

382
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think it's funny though,</v>

383
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>like in the grand scheme of things that the bigger they are,</v>

384
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>usually the cooler are like a Tom Hanks.</v>

385
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not a decade.</v>

386
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

387
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Or some of them.</v>

388
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Or say in the world of comedy,</v>

390
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Chris Rock shows up to the comedy story shows up alone with a notebook.</v>

391
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Ask us if he can go on.</v>

392
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

393
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

394
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.391
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

395
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:51.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>arguably the top comic in the world,</v>

397
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 1>at least one of the most recognized right now.</v>

398
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Take somebody who's like maybe the 156 best comic in the world,</v>

399
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.470
<v Speaker 1>but men steal.</v>

400
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

401
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:01.591
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

402
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:06.591
<v Speaker 1>What I will get on stage and Bogart and go on pat and showing up to a war</v>

403
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.021
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

404
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't,</v>

405
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you know if the number one guys exercising that he much humility,</v>

406
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody below needs to follow suit.</v>

407
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

408
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.261
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

409
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:20.261
<v Speaker 1>an amazing dance that you play when you're trying to get attention on stage</v>

410
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>because you're trying to get these people to look at you.</v>

411
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:27.381
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to like perform the most entertaining set possible and the best</v>

412
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.004
<v Speaker 1>way possible,</v>

413
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but in some way or another and you have to divert all that adulation away from</v>

414
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:35.094
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

415
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out a way to accept it and then like turn it right back to</v>

416
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the people and you can't bathe in it.</v>

417
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>You can't like take it seriously.</v>

418
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that you are the shit or you will suck.</v>

419
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to remember too,</v>

420
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>we're not saving fucking life.</v>

421
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.313
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

422
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's like another thing too.</v>

423
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:51.091
<v Speaker 1>It's like with comedy,</v>

424
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but you have so many other interests.</v>

425
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have 23 and a half hours a day to spare.</v>

426
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>You can either become just a fucking miserable prick or you can educate yourself</v>

427
00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 1>or pick up another passion,</v>

428
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

429
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

430
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

431
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you can become completely obsessed with your career.</v>

432
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:07.630

436
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

437
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:11.441

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

440
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

441
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>an interesting thing that Mark Marin just did.</v>

442
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>He did this keynote speech at a,</v>

443
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>the just for laughs and I listened in on it cause I have this sort of love hate</v>

444
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>thing with Ma'am Marin helped me out when I was an open miker and uh,</v>

445
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>gave me some real solid advice and real solid compliments.</v>

446
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.561
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

447
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:33.041
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

448
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Colin been doing comedy for a real short period of time,</v>

450
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:36.304
<v Speaker 1>less than a year.</v>

451
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And Marin was established and I was like,</v>

452
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

453
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this guy just,</v>

454
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 1>just totally pumped me up.</v>

456
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

457
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I can fucking do this.</v>

458
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

459
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

460
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.501
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

461
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:44.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:45.604
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

463
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.860
<v Speaker 1>from a guy like that who was real stingy with compliments through,</v>

465
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

466
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So for years I've been trying to be so fucking nice to him,</v>

468
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

469
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>because of that note,</v>

470
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 1>so every opportunity to shit on him or to fuck with him,</v>

471
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:04.411
<v Speaker 1>I've avoided and ducked because I felt like I owed him for something that</v>

472
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>happened when we were really young.</v>

473
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

474
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

475
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that's why I did his podcast,</v>

477
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 1>even though he had said some stupid shit about me and doesn't even know me.</v>

478
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Like we need to have conversations and like,</v>

479
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.640
<v Speaker 1>what did they say about you?</v>

480
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

481
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

482
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>he said a bunch of really dumb shit.</v>

483
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about that,</v>

484
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the really dumb things that he said is that,</v>

485
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

486
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I've done more bad to comedy than men.</v>

487
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Sia has because of doing fear factor and his rationale.</v>

488
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>This is a true argument.</v>

489
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 1>His rationale was that in doing fear factor,</v>

490
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 1>I had taken work away from standup comics who also worked as writers.</v>

491
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.210
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that in me being a standup comic who also has a side job of</v>

492
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.930
<v Speaker 1>hosting somehow or another,</v>

493
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>these other standup comics,</v>

494
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>their side job of writing sitcoms outside of standup comedy,</v>

495
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 1>their side job is somehow or another more valid that it's still,</v>

496
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it's still not comedy,</v>

497
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:55.301
<v Speaker 1>it's none.</v>

498
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Let stand up comedy.</v>

499
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about a guy who,</v>

500
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.540
<v Speaker 1>a massive plagiarist who just ruined comics' lives and you're comparing them to</v>

501
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 1>me because our hosting a game show.</v>

502
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.153
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

503
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>watching this,</v>

504
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 1>listening to this keynote,</v>

505
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.550
<v Speaker 1>now I understand a little bit better because three years ago he was talking</v>

506
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 1>about how he was so depressed he couldn't get any road work.</v>

507
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.583
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't,</v>

508
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get booked anywhere and no one wanted to have meetings with them.</v>

509
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was going on.</v>

510
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

511
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>he was thinking about committing suicide.</v>

512
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And this is just three years ago,</v>

513
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>it was before he started doing his podcast.</v>

514
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

515
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.010
<v Speaker 1>this is all the shit was going down.</v>

516
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:30.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

517
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

518
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>three years ago I wasn't doing fear factor,</v>

520
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure before then the bitterness was just as much.</v>

521
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>When some people see other people get success,</v>

522
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>they fester and it drives me fucking crazy.</v>

523
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And they want to look for holes in it to want to look for things that are wrong</v>

524
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:45.581
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

525
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:46.414
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying,</v>

526
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

527
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>look at that fucking guy,</v>

528
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:48.401
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do it.</v>

529
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

530
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

531
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I love drew Carey.</v>

532
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

533
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to host the price is right for a fucking million dollars an</v>

534
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

535
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

536
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

537
00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what he's doing.</v>

538
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>The price is right or is that,</v>

539
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

540
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.120
<v Speaker 1>he took over Bob Market.</v>

541
00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:03.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know what that shows me that you,</v>

542
00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you're a creature who is survival of the fittest.</v>

543
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 1>When this business changes,</v>

544

<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

579
00:15:44.761 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you look like it's like soul crushing shit,</v>

580
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just a fucking Gig.</v>

582
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:50.600
<v Speaker 1>When I see drew Carey,</v>

583
00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to fucking drew Carey sold out look who could drive your persona.</v>

584
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>But Marin has this thing because he was so unsuccessful.</v>

585
00:15:56.541 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 1>He looks for reasons why other people success is either invalid or,</v>

586
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>or negative or bad.</v>

587
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.591
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

588
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:08.591
<v Speaker 1>this fucking festering personality of constantly obsessing about his career and</v>

589
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.154
<v Speaker 1>negativity is,</v>

590
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.021
<v Speaker 1>it was a fascinating,</v>

591
00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:11.510
<v Speaker 1>the keynote,</v>

592
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said that he joked around,</v>

593
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it was a really funny joke,</v>

594
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

595
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who thought,</v>

596
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.901
<v Speaker 1>Louise,</v>

597
00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>a TV show should have been called.</v>

598
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:19.131
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>

599
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Mark Marin know because they started out together.</v>

600
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:23.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

601
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it's got some fucking crazy jealous and it's about Louie.</v>

602
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Then he's up in Boston or in New York.</v>

603
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:28.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

604
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I knew in Boston when I was an open Mike.</v>

605
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.400
<v Speaker 1>He was at same kind of with me and he was always busy.</v>

606
00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:34.234
<v Speaker 1>Khan to everybody.</v>

607
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jamie kills teas and kind of to Ari Shapiro.</v>

609
00:16:36.671 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>This Brian Callen wanted to beat him up.</v>

610
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

611
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 1>he's been a cut to me.</v>

612
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.793
<v Speaker 1>He's a cunt.</v>

613
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why he's a Qantas cause he's a cunt to himself.</v>

614
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.170
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy with the,</v>

615
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 1>is a really nice guy.</v>

616
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Nice guy.</v>

00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:48.201
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

618
00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:48.861
<v Speaker 1>He insulted,</v>

619
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:51.080
<v Speaker 1>count on stage in front of Accountants,</v>

620
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>friends who came to see him in New York.</v>

621
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Not a disrespect.</v>

622
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Cowan wanted to kill him.</v>

623
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

624
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Kellen even like said something and threatened to him and said,</v>

625
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 1>look and I,</v>

626
00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:59.270

627
00:16:59.271 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you want to fuck with me and fucking mean front of my friends.</v>

629
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.953
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll hit you.</v>

630
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened or who he just was,</v>

631
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 1>just the stories that I'm getting.</v>

632
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>But I know that he gave Ari unsolicited criticism and I know he fucks with</v>

633
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Kilstein Brian and you fucking with the levels constantly tweaking your fucking</v>

634
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 1>with my head Bro.</v>

635
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.853
<v Speaker 1>Leave it alone.</v>

636
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 1>But why's he doing that?</v>

637
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.351
<v Speaker 1>Who's doing that?</v>

638
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's doing that to himself.</v>

639
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.200
<v Speaker 1>His whole mind is fucked.</v>

640
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who's been doing comedy for forever but still can't get successful.</v>

641
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>We were in Irvine the other day,</v>

642
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>we did the Irvine Improv and I'm like,</v>

643
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

644
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>do you guys pretty much sell out here every weekend?</v>

645
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not one mark man was here.</v>

646
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It was like a barely go to a hundred tickets sold each show and I was like a</v>

647
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 1>hundred tickets at the Irvine Improv.</v>

648
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:39.531
<v Speaker 1>Like that's impossible.</v>

649
00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:41.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this,</v>

650
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

651
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>this career that he's had for all these years,</v>

652
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>25 plus years.</v>

653
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

654
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously done a lot of shit wrong until we did this podcast and this</v>

656
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you just nail it.</v>

657
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Podcasting figured out what he's good at is really getting into people's minds.</v>

658
00:17:56.871 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>She knows his own neurosis is he knows his own,</v>

659
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 1>his own fears and hopes and dreams.</v>

660
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And stand up and he can relate to other comics.</v>

661
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>And then now he's sort of like calming down and being,</v>

662
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but he still does do she shit.</v>

663
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Like Anthony Bourdain is going to be on my podcast.</v>

664
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh seriously?</v>

665
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote uh,</v>

667
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.661
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

668
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I heard you're going to do Rogan's podcast but he ain't me.</v>

669
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

670
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 1>it would be deep.</v>

671
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I like to go and that's exactly what he ain't me.</v>

672
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:21.924
<v Speaker 1>It would be deep like,</v>

673
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.711
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

674
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>go go take a Goddamn Yoga class.</v>

675
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Go to one of those places where everybody just hugs everybody,</v>

676
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

677
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Just go and get some hugs,</v>

678
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:31.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

679
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.663
<v Speaker 1>What the what the eff,</v>

680
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this negative fostering fucking kind of thinking is exactly what we're talking</v>

681
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 1>about where people don't have shit outside of their career and if they don't</v>

682
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>have a bunch of other things,</v>

683
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 1>if you have something going on,</v>

684
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I could care less about what's going on with others that they never taken away</v>

685
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

686
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 1>You're not taking work away from me,</v>

687
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>which nobody is.</v>

688
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is,</v>

689
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine with that.</v>

691
00:18:52.321 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I that comedy cop thing to me and about a year into comedy when</v>

692
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:56.761
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

693
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.211
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>

694
00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I've got my own thing to say now I'm going to be concerned with who goes on for</v>

695
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:00.481
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

696
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:01.231
<v Speaker 1>what goes on after me.</v>

697
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

698
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

699
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.530
<v Speaker 1>it's another thing that Marin had said on the show once about his,</v>

700
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:04.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

701
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>his parents never fostered a healthy sense of competitiveness in him.</v>

702
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's one of those guys that like if he's losing,</v>

703
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll just turn the board over.</v>

704
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking take your ball and go home.</v>

705
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's that,</v>

706
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>that crazy sort of fucking dysfunctional thinking that,</v>

707
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that thinking that this disconnected is what it is.</v>

708
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You're disconnected from other people and you want it all.</v>

709
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>You want all the adulation.</v>

710
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.151
<v Speaker 1>You want all the love.</v>

711
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:31.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not getting what you need,</v>

712
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 1>fuck everybody else.</v>

713
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Then negativity starts.</v>

714
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>You start throwing your negativity at other people.</v>

715
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can truly be positive at all is if you feel like you're</v>

716
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 1>getting enough positivity to be okay.</v>

717
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I've got a good level here.</v>

718
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I got a good stash of positivity.</v>

719
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Now I can be nice.</v>

720
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating psychological study to watch all these guys to watch these</v>

721
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 1>mark Marin guys said were like literally on the brink of suicide,</v>

722
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.950
<v Speaker 1>and I think I tried to like mark.</v>

724
00:19:58.951 --> 00:19:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

725
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I try to be nice to him as much as I can.</v>

726
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.034
<v Speaker 1>I try to like him,</v>

727
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

728
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.061
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

729
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time seeing all that.</v>

730
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to just throttle a guy like that and go,</v>

731
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

732
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 1>let's sit down and write down what the fuck is wrong with you and just work it</v>

733
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:13.890
<v Speaker 1>out for once and for all right,</v>

734
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 1>let's not deal with this for 25 fucking more years.</v>

735
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure this shit out.</v>

736
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Frankie paste this thing,</v>

737
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:20.514
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

738
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

739
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.621
<v Speaker 1>Exactly though.</v>

740
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's not go that better.</v>

741
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking guy.</v>

742
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:26.730
<v Speaker 1>That guy I want.</v>

743
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 1>He got mad at me once because I called him.</v>

744
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I said the old school comedy talent of Frankie Pace.</v>

745
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:32.971
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said,</v>

746
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>old school and he doesn't understand that old school is like skills.</v>

747
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.171
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

748
00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:38.490
<v Speaker 1>no man is old school.</v>

749
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Like my man's an old school [inaudible] route karate guy.</v>

750
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You can say that to a dude,</v>

751
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>they'll give me some knuckles,</v>

752
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:43.771
<v Speaker 1>he'd be laughing,</v>

753
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:43.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:44.820
<v Speaker 1>that's like a compliment.</v>

755
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 1>But when I called him,</v>

756
00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:46.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.801
<v Speaker 1>an old Mi ma,</v>

758
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:48.551
<v Speaker 1>he's sucks.</v>

759
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even said old school.</v>

760
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

761
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 1>go on stage without your stupid fucking devil horns in your bag of shit and you</v>

762
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.270
<v Speaker 1>bring with you everywhere and then even a veto without the talent liability.</v>

763
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.711
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>

764
00:20:57.711 --> 00:20:58.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a kind of a human,</v>

765
00:20:58.901 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same thing.</v>

766
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like here's a guy who doesn't feel like there's enough positivity out there</v>

767
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.560
<v Speaker 1>and if he hasn't stockpile a big stash of it,</v>

768
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 1>at least fucking kids,</v>

769
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:10.250
<v Speaker 1>they think they're funny.</v>

770
00:21:10.251 --> 00:21:10.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

771
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I get to do was talk dirty.</v>

772
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So he goes on stage and introduces me after I introduced him with this old</v>

773
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 1>school thing and he goes,</v>

774
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:22.890
<v Speaker 1>this guy thinks I'm old school and this and I and I,</v>

775
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and then he shits on me and he start shitting on my jokes is all before he</v>

776
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 1>brings me up on stage.</v>

777
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:27.671
<v Speaker 1>So I go on stage.</v>

778
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even,</v>

779
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know exactly how to handle him.</v>

780
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So I go on and say as I go,</v>

781
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.261
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

782
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

783
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.480
<v Speaker 1>before I address any of what you just said,</v>

784
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.050
<v Speaker 1>so I just start talking him as he's walking through the crowd and go,</v>

785
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>old school is a positive thing.</v>

786
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.401
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

787
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 1>am I right folks?</v>

788
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>And they start clapping.</v>

789
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:41.801
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

790
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like a rapper term.</v>

791
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.391
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

792
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:44.224
<v Speaker 1>when you say someone's older,</v>

793
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

794
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.330
<v Speaker 1>variable that you must be new school.</v>

795
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

796
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>are you trying to say that I'm not good?</v>

797
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't like me.</v>

798
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.051
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

799
00:21:50.051 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to say?</v>

800
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.061
<v Speaker 1>So then I,</v>

801
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I start smiling and instead of getting upset at him,</v>

802
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I start mocking him.</v>

803
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:55.641
<v Speaker 1>I go from a,</v>

804
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>how do you not like me?</v>

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you not like my comedy?</v>

806
00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:58.661
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

00:21:58.661 --> 00:21:59.350
<v Speaker 1>what's the matter?</v>

808
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.591
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

809
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.200

00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:48.681
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to make it.</v>

860
00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the fairest business.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

866
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.713
<v Speaker 1>We don't age,</v>

867
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.120
<v Speaker 1>they never shoot talent away.</v>

868
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.580
<v Speaker 1>But those guys who can find all these things wrong,</v>

869
00:22:57.581 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the club booker or whatever,</v>

870
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 1>like it's mostly at the comedy store,</v>

871
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:01.211
<v Speaker 1>you'll find guys,</v>

872
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:01.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

873
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.321
<v Speaker 1>I'll always say him,</v>

874
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>what other club is putting you on silent,</v>

875
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'll never get another club.</v>

876
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

877
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the comic store has got a fucking half a million assholes.</v>

878
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 1>There really shouldn't be on stage,</v>

879
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.930
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

880
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 1>they've snuck into that system back in the 1970 [inaudible] stuck there.</v>

881
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 1>You can go there any given night on a Monday or Tuesday and you'll see three or</v>

882
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:19.451
<v Speaker 1>four comics.</v>

883
00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:24.451
<v Speaker 1>You can't fucking believe a professional comedian at the comedy store in</v>

884
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.444
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood.</v>

885
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

886
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

887
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that's Mecca.</v>

888
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>The best of the best and the worst of the worst.</v>

889
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.801
<v Speaker 1>The worst,</v>

890
00:23:29.801 --> 00:23:30.120
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

891
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>But beyond bad advocates,</v>

892
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 1>high in the basement goes real fucking vape.</v>

893
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

894
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of room clears back in the day we would see them.</v>

895
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>We would look at that.</v>

896
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.523
<v Speaker 1>That's the face you,</v>

897
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.341
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what,</v>

898
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>say you would look at the lineup,</v>

899
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you would see Freddy Lockhart and then you look at before you and UCL.</v>

900
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

901
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.471
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

902
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I worked the cover booth and I turned my shirt inside out</v>

903
00:23:47.191 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 1>because I was embarrassed to work there because I have the answer to the likes</v>

904
00:23:49.611 --> 00:23:54.611
<v Speaker 1>of ways like Billy and Rozzy on stage date year or whoever is putting on given</v>

905
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 1>eulogies as they do and I remember you,</v>

906
00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:58.230
<v Speaker 1>you drove the NSX and I,</v>

907
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was like if I saw that insects pulling up,</v>

908
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you were like the calvary.</v>

909
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

910
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

911
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.500
<v Speaker 1>a legitimate bonafide comedian.</v>

912
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh real comedian that I can show what all these people that had to look in the</v>

913
00:24:07.171 --> 00:24:11.570
<v Speaker 1>straight face in charge of $20 to see the likes of Dave here up there telling</v>

914
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>why is it my cell phone worked with the antenna down but up.</v>

915
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.371
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

916
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.210
<v Speaker 1>What's wow.</v>

917
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

918
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 1>That was his closer,</v>

919
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 1>well the poor guy,</v>

920
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>he stopped doing comedy and he started doing some,</v>

921
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>like I think you started doing some sort of humanitarian work or some point that</v>

922
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a really nice guy.</v>

923
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.051
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

924
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

925
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I sold that guy.</v>

926
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200
<v Speaker 1>My they,</v>

927

<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

928
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I switched at Dave title bar.</v>

929
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

930
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.693
<v Speaker 1>it Davis</v>

931
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>peer.</v>

932
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:38.841
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

933
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't even hear it was a sweet guy or I don't even remember his act.</v>

934
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 1>He worked at the store too.</v>

935
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:42.861
<v Speaker 1>That really,</v>

936
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:43.131
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

937
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:43.964
<v Speaker 1>really thin guy.</v>

938
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Real,</v>

939
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.530
<v Speaker 1>real skinny and funny.</v>

940
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I had a nice Volkswagen.</v>

941
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.004
<v Speaker 1>A sure Rocco.</v>

942
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

943
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that was what it was called.</v>

944
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:51.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

945
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:52.491
<v Speaker 1>not the SIROCCO.</v>

946
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a Shrub,</v>

947
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

948
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Volkswagen,</v>

949
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 1>a pretty sweet Volkswagen.</v>

950
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.681
<v Speaker 1>And I started,</v>

951
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

952
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.581
<v Speaker 1>that's what we got.</v>

953
00:24:58.581 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Like one of my first development.</v>

954
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.913
<v Speaker 1>What year was this?</v>

955
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>This was 94.</v>

956
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.540
<v Speaker 1>When I first came to Hollywood Volkswagen,</v>

957
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.860
<v Speaker 1>90 to 91 or something like that was a night.</v>

958
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It was a nice car.</v>

959
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I was in DC of course for my first new car and uh,</v>

960
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I got a super turbo and so,</v>

961
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

962
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I had this other car just laying around and you know,</v>

963
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Dave was telling me he needed my,</v>

964
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:18.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:19.810
<v Speaker 1>needed a car but he doesn't have any money.</v>

966
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm like how much money you got and you wind up giving me like a thousand bucks</v>

967
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:23.391
<v Speaker 1>for it or something like that.</v>

968
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:24.111
<v Speaker 1>I just gave it to him.</v>

969
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was exactly,</v>

970
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

971
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 1>the car was worth like 10 grand.</v>

972
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's awesome.</v>

973
00:25:28.251 --> 00:25:29.084
<v Speaker 1>Just gave it to him.</v>

974
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I take it he's a nice guy,</v>

975
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 1>but he still drives that motherfucker and he lives in it now.</v>

976
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It's got 300,000 miles.</v>

977
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

978
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.713
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>

979
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

980
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 1>an interesting place because of that very reason though.</v>

981
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like it didn't dent the lesson of the comedy store was that there was no</v>

982
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>rules there,</v>

983
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.490
<v Speaker 1>that it was chaotic and ridiculous and it made no sense.</v>

984
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

985
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 1>a guy like Eddie Griffin would go on at nine o'clock and stay on stage until</v>

986
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 1>three o'clock in the morning.</v>

987
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Like all the time.</v>

988
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a pool with no lifeguard.</v>

989
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just there's just a bunch of kids swimming in summer jumping off the roof.</v>

990
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.001
<v Speaker 1>But because of that,</v>

991
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:02.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

992
00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people develop that sort of habit of just going on stage and not giving</v>

993
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 1>a fuck about the clock.</v>

994
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.841
<v Speaker 1>And I did too.</v>

995
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And I'm guilty of it for sure.</v>

996
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of long sets.</v>

997
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.680
<v Speaker 1>They're doing them a favor though.</v>

998
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 1>And you're also a guy who gave back to the club.</v>

999
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1000
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:14.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1001
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:16.370
<v Speaker 1>there's little things that go without saying.</v>

1002
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You give us a new roof,</v>

1003
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:18.170
<v Speaker 1>a new sound system.</v>

1004
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Let him run the light.</v>

1005
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Charles Fleischer would give me a second jewel.</v>

1006
00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 1>We appointed to 40 extra minutes.</v>

1007
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:23.931

1026
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.880
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1027
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:42.890

1028
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 1>He got pissed and he started going over to laugh factor.</v>

1029

<v Speaker 1>I want to get him on the podcast.</v>

1032
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.941

<v Speaker 1>I lost it before I stored it and the computer,</v>

1036
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I might have his number.</v>

1037
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a fascinating character.</v>

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And he's Steve.</v>

1039
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.780
<v Speaker 1>He's the voice of Roger Rabbit for people don't know.</v>

1040
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1041
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but he's also a scientist.</v>

1042
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>You know it was in the back of the comedy story.</v>

1043
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 1>He said he came up with some geometric new geometric structure and been working</v>

1044
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:12.510
<v Speaker 1>on it for the last 36 days.</v>

1045
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>So working on this mathematical structure and then the fucking brought it in.</v>

1047
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It was pieced together with a little plastic cause I go,</v>

1048
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take you to put this fucking thing together?</v>

1049
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.001
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1050
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>pieced it all together himself.</v>

1051
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>This weird multi sided geometric pattern.</v>

1052
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1053
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:26.610

00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you've got to catch them on the right mixture.</v>

1107
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.200
<v Speaker 1>You know you might catch him when he's on some weed and he's friendly as flag</v>

1108
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 1>gacked out and wants to cut your fucking hard out with a fork.</v>

1109
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't need my heart getting cut out with a fork cause I need to figure out a</v>

1110
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

1111
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>People would complain as the audio is fucked up Brian.</v>

1112
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1113
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I was getting some reverb in my hair.</v>

1114
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want,</v>

1115
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared to test it.</v>

1116
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.700
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1117
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 1>well that's not good because then it's good on the MP three but that's what I</v>

1118
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 1>was playing with earlier.</v>

1119
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Well how do we know what it sounds like on the Ustream?</v>

1120
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.650
<v Speaker 1>See the problem is this laptop doesn't have any a headphone jack cause it only</v>

1121
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 1>has one jack for headphone.</v>

1122
00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 1>He does this one have a headphone Jack.</v>

1123
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:38.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1124
00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if he,</v>

1125
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.110
<v Speaker 1>if I can plug it in there and listen to her,</v>

1126
00:29:41.111 --> 00:29:41.591
<v Speaker 1>I can try.</v>

1127
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:42.341
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you plug it in here?</v>

1128
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:42.611
<v Speaker 1>I list.</v>

1129
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to interrupt you?</v>

1130
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>You well I want to find out what's going on man.</v>

1131
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Because with the last one was terrible.</v>

1132
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I get mad at me mad.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You always just when you're retarded,</v>

1134
00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I was just playing with the level.</v>

1135
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Totally not.</v>

1136
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.031
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1138
00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Now you're listening to and making sure you're,</v>

1139
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.333
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1140
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:04.763
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1141
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.500

1142
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:09.334

<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a big spinning ball.</v>

1146
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Ustream is very nice for having us on and all that good stuff,</v>

1147
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it kind of sucks.</v>

1148
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.620
