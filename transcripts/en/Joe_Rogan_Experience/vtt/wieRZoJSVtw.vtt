1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.530
<v Speaker 1>That's very cool.</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:12.001
<v Speaker 2>A guy named was his online twitter or</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram handles tgt studios and he</v>

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 2>makes these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had one made for Elon.</v>

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk loved it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we made him one when he made one with</v>

7
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 2>like this very beautiful redwood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are one of those things.</v>

8
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 2>May Not have jamie the some diodes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Nixey tubes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tubes.</v>

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>The old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to get them from Russia.</v>

12
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has them delivered over from Russia.</v>

13
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>So they might have like listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>devices implanted in the most.</v>

14
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Brian,</v>

15
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.873
<v Speaker 2>good to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

16
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Great to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 2>Great to have you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me about this tour that you're</v>

18
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

19
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 2>it's a world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to keep this soccer like a fist.</v>

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

21
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>That perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>So we'll tour starts next week</v>

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 3>and I'm the UK and then we go everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the South Island in New Zealand all</v>

24
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:03.220
<v Speaker 3>the way to the Arctic circle to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Svalbard,</v>

25
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>which is North,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the furthest north that you can go on a</v>

26
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 3>commercial aircraft in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>where in the states for a month in a</v>

27
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 3>mainly may and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

28
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about cosmology and about the</v>

29
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 3>questions that cosmology raises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Abo,</v>

30
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 3>interested in the science of how did the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe begin,</v>

31
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.790
<v Speaker 3>even questions of what may have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a universal eternal.</v>

32
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Is there such a thing as before the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang.</v>

33
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 3>What is the future of the universe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does complexity emerge spontaneously</v>

34
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 3>in a universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we sort of take it for granted</v>

35
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 3>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big bang and it's all heart</v>

36
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 3>and there's just this kind of hot glow</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>

37
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 3>And I altered that spontaneously in 13</v>
<v Speaker 3>point 8 billion years.</v>

38
00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 3>You get something like the earth with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the civilization and life on it.</v>

39
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 3>So how does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we know anything about that?</v>

40
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do.</v>

41
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking the question rhetorically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know quite a lot about it,</v>

42
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really about showing the size and</v>

43
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 3>scale of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but addressing those questions I think</v>

44
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.850
<v Speaker 3>everybody has about what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to be human?</v>

45
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:11.851
<v Speaker 3>This tiny little finite life that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>lead in a possibly infinite universe.</v>

46
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 3>How do you make sense of that?</v>

47
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly exciting to me that</v>

48
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant audience for this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what Neil degrasse Tyson had been</v>

49
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 2>doing and what a lot of public touring</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals are doing now,</v>

50
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 2>they're doing these giant theaters and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are coming out to see these</v>

51
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 2>shows and we're realizing that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

52
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use the term market for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a demand for this and</v>

53
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly fascinated by this and it's</v>

54
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>spreading information and spreading</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

55
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the UK particularly,</v>

56
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Wembley arena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

57
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about 10,000 people,</v>

58
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>12,000 people in the shows and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

59
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 2>they are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll the big shows,</v>

60
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 2>spectacular screens and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming full to think that they</v>

61
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>come into here about what we know</v>

62
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580
<v Speaker 3>about the universe and nature and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

63
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm not surprised people are</v>

64
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 3>interested because these are questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody asks.</v>

65
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 3>You don't to just why am I here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

66
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 3>everybody's sat there asking that</v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

67
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is that there is a framework,</v>

68
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a framework of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are things we know about the</v>

69
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it is true that science scientists</v>

70
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 3>are not going to tell you why you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and you're not to say what the</v>

71
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 3>meaning of life is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is actually a,</v>

72
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 3>there are things you need to know if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to start to explore those questions</v>

73
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 3>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to know that there are 2</v>

74
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 3>trillion galaxies in the observable</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

75
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 3>You need to know the Milky Way Galaxy</v>
<v Speaker 3>has got 200 billion stars.</v>

76
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Most of those stars now we know have</v>
<v Speaker 3>planetary systems.</v>

77
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 3>We estimate there are something like 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion earth like planets or</v>

78
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 3>potentially earth like planets in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milky Way galaxy alone.</v>

79
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 3>So if you're asking questions about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>is my place in the universe,</v>

80
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 3>you need to know those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

81
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a framework within which you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>think when you get to those numbers,</v>

82
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about trillions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions and all those zeros,</v>

83
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 3>my brain just goes numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

84
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 3>there's this lack of comprehension that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm well aware of.</v>

85
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Like those numbers get thrown about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

86
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$200 million now.</v>

87
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think every scientist that no</v>

88
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 3>scientist can picture that number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he even the small number $200</v>

89
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 3>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of stars in one galaxy.</v>

90
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 3>And then when you say 2 trillion</v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxies,</v>

91
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I challenge anyone to be able to picture</v>

92
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is the reality that we've</v>

93
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 3>observed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

94
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

95
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean we haven't counted all 2 trillion</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way we have.</v>

96
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 3>We have a thing called the Sloan digital</v>
<v Speaker 3>sky survey,</v>

97
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 3>which maps the positions of galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can,</v>

98
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much should the sky you surveyed and</v>

99
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 3>you know how many galaxies you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>counted and then you can spread that</v>

100
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 3>across the wider universe and you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>this picture of a vast and possibly</v>

101
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 3>infinite universe meet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

102
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 3>we know that the universe or very</v>
<v Speaker 3>strongly suspect that the university is</v>

103
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 3>much bigger than the piece we can see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have good reason to think that's</v>

104
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's infinite or not is another</v>

105
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that goes to your,</v>

106
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you picture infinity while no one</v>

107
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 3>can picture infinity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird thing as well about,</v>

108
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

109
00:05:20.691 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 3>we say the universe began 13 point 8</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago.</v>

110
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's a measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because we can measure the speed that</v>

111
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 3>all the galaxies are flying away from us</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

112
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 3>And then you can run time backwards if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like.</v>

113
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 3>So to find out when they were all on top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of each other.</v>

114
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 3>And so it's quite a simple measurement</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've done that.</v>

115
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 3>So we say the universe began 13 point 8</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago,</v>

116
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>but actually all we know really was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe was very hot and very dense at</v>

117
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 3>that time and we have some theories that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe was in existence before</v>

118
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 3>that and perhaps some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstantial evidence and that means</v>

119
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 3>that actually the universe could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have always been their eternal.</v>

120
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

121
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 3>when I tell it to people sometimes they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a bit,</v>

122
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 3>some people got upset about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people would rather it had a</v>

123
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that it might have been around</v>

124
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 3>forever is more frightening somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the fact that it began.</v>

125
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting the way people's minds</v>

126
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What terrifies you the most and eternal</v>

127
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 3>universe or a finite universe?</v>

128
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other,</v>

129
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:23.050
<v Speaker 4>both incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The eternal universe.</v>

130
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.000
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>

131
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.900
<v Speaker 4>W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was an eternal universe,</v>

132
00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.040
<v Speaker 4>is that negate the theory of the big</v>
<v Speaker 4>bang or does it mean that there's a</v>

133
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:35.041
<v Speaker 4>constant cycle of big bangs and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>expansion and then recompression or</v>

134
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.210
<v Speaker 3>could do say those theories that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in vogue.</v>

135
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Some of those theories are back in vogue</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

136
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them say that there's a cycling</v>

137
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:46.600
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

138
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:51.250
<v Speaker 3>so the big bang is an event when space</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets very hot and very dense and filled</v>

139
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.100
<v Speaker 3>with particles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that may happen again,</v>

140
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 3>are some of the other theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

141
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a theory called eternal</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflation,</v>

142
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 3>which is a theory that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's actually the most popular</v>

143
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:02.410
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the moment,</v>

144
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Speaker 3>but what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why the big bang is the way that it</v>

145
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:07.900
<v Speaker 3>is who's got some very special features,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Big Bang,</v>

146
00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:11.590
<v Speaker 3>which we could talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but inflation is the idea that space</v>

147
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 3>space time was around before the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang and it was expanding extremely fast</v>

148
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.840
<v Speaker 3>and there was doubling in size in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most popular of these theories.</v>

149
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Every 10 to the minus 37 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is point naught,</v>

150
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:23.911
<v Speaker 3>naught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naught,</v>

151
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:24.371
<v Speaker 3>naught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naught,</v>

152
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:26.710
<v Speaker 3>naught with 37 knots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of a second.</v>

153
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.240
<v Speaker 3>So he's an imaginably fast expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the idea is that draws to a</v>

154
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 3>close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so quite naturally sort of dies away and</v>

155
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 3>the expansion slows down and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy that was taken there was causing</v>

156
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:41.110
<v Speaker 3>that expansions sort of gets dumped into</v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

157
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 3>And heats it up and makes particles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we call the big bank and</v>

158
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:50.011
<v Speaker 3>those theories that slight extension to</v>
<v Speaker 3>those and say that that that slowing</v>

159
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 3>down just happens in little patches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the universe,</v>

160
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:59.110
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university still inflating that insane</v>

161
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 3>sort of speed and they're just little</v>
<v Speaker 3>patches stop and they are big banks.</v>

162
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 3>So you get multiple universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a multiverse,</v>

163
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.860
<v Speaker 3>it's called the inflationary multiverse</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we are in one of those bubbles and</v>

164
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the more popular theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad's another one.</v>

165
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean that right now,</v>

166
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 4>aware of what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

167
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can sort of visualize it in some sort</v>

168
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 4>of a graphic form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's incomprehensible like my mind</v>

169
00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the capacity to expand</v>

170
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sense of distance and size to that,</v>

171
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.050
<v Speaker 4>that grass is this because of just the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way we evolved.</v>

172
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.850
<v Speaker 4>We evolved here on earth to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the space.</v>

173
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:44.851
<v Speaker 4>It's in front of us and now over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>course of an industrial civilization and</v>

174
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 4>education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are now grasping these concepts that</v>

175
00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:53.571
<v Speaker 4>are so alien to the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tangible reality that we exist in</v>

176
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that's</v>

177
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

178
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 3>even very simple things like you go back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Greeks.</v>

180
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 3>So Aristotle and the great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 3>very clever people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they thought the earth was the</v>

182
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.230
<v Speaker 3>center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

183
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Because it feels like it's at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>central is it feels like we're not</v>

184
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.590
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

185
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 3>and that's quite a deep point actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>in physics.</v>

186
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like why is it that we're flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>around relative to the sun very fast at</v>

187
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever speed is 18 miles a second or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

188
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 3>And the whole solar system is going</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the Milky Way Galaxy and so on.</v>

189
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that we don't feel it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the Greeks quite naturally</v>

190
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:30.541
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

191
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 3>because we're at the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

192
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 3>they also said everything falls to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

193
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 3>So therefore the earth has to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>center is natural.</v>

194
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually it's quite a deep a</v>

195
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to understand why it doesn't feel</v>

196
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 3>that we're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go all the way to Einstein</v>

197
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 3>really for someone to take that very</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

198
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 3>And he why he said actually he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

199
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.330
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

200
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 3>there's a great little explanation in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Hawking's brief history of time</v>

201
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the idea that you can't tell</v>

202
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 3>whether you're moving or not demolishes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion of absolute space.</v>

203
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 3>So if we think about space space to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>or most people,</v>

204
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 3>I suppose you'd think it the way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton didn't have a big box within</v>

205
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:12.760
<v Speaker 3>which things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's got to be,</v>

206
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 3>that's a natural picture of space and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe isn't,</v>

207
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:18.690
<v Speaker 3>it isn't a thing in which all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>planets and galaxies are placed.</v>

208
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

209
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the brief history of time harking</v>

210
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:22.501
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

211
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 3>imagine bouncing a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he bends a bowl at the table,</v>

212
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 3>now a tennis ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I drop it and I catch it again.</v>

213
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say I drop it and it takes a</v>

214
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 3>second to bands up.</v>

215
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 3>So in that second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth has moved about 80 miles or so</v>

216
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 3>in space around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could ask the question,</v>

217
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 3>did that ball returned to the same place</v>
<v Speaker 3>in space or not?</v>

218
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.580
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is you can't answer it</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

219
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 3>It does from our perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But from the perspective of someone</v>

220
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 3>watching the earth go all the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

221
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 3>the sudden it went up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I caught it again.</v>

222
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:56.940
<v Speaker 3>It had moved 18 miles and then from some</v>
<v Speaker 3>other perspective it would have been</v>

223
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the point is you can't say this is a</v>

224
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 3>point in space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it came back to the same place because</v>

225
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.750
<v Speaker 3>that just depends on your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depends on whether he watching the</v>

226
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 3>sudden the earth around the sun or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

227
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Einstein said that means there's no</v>

228
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 3>such thing as absolute space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of follows if you think</v>

229
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.424
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

230
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But that's a difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

231
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put difficult thought process,</v>

232
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

233
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 3>that's essentially what's happening when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on a plane.</v>

234
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're throwing a ball up in the air</v>

235
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 3>and catching it on the planes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having another much smaller scale,</v>

236
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:29.994
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

237
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're flying at whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 miles an hour relative to grand,</v>

238
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but when you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

239
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 3>and Einstein elevated that to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>principal and said,</v>

240
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 3>if you're moving it but it'd be not</v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerated and you just moving at a</v>

241
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 3>constant speed in a plane or now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's essentially what we're</v>

242
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:46.111
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

243
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 3>We're moving around the sun that</v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively constant speed.</v>

244
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Then you can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's no experiment you can do.</v>

245
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 3>We could look at the decay of</v>
<v Speaker 3>radioactive nuclear,</v>

246
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>saw some electricity and magnetism or</v>
<v Speaker 3>Banzel have a pendulum,</v>

247
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no experiment you can do to</v>

248
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 3>tell you whether you're moving or not.</v>

249
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that concept has no meaning because you</v>

250
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 3>can't measure it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's led Einstein to</v>

251
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 3>relativity so that that's the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 3>general relativity,</v>

252
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 3>which is our best theory of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

253
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that we think that the known</v>

254
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 3>universe is larger than what we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>observe?</v>

255
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point is that it's an expanding and</v>

256
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 3>we always see the same radiation out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

257
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 3>so the glow of the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is some deeper reasons.</v>

258
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one from the theory of inflation,</v>

259
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

260
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best way to explain the universe,</v>

261
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 3>the properties that we see is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much bigger than the piece we can</v>

262
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

263
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 3>we measure space to be what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat.</v>

264
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't even have to say what's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>flattery is flat.</v>

265
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>So if you imagine slices of space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's imagine slicer to them at</v>

266
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 3>different times.</v>

267
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just sliced the universe and say</v>

268
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.840
<v Speaker 3>there's a big sheets like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a tesla sheet of space and there's</v>

269
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 3>another sheet and another sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it can,</v>

270
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 3>it can have a geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

271
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 3>It can be flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a table top or it could be curved</v>

272
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 3>like a sphere or it could be curved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opposite direction,</v>

273
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a saddle or a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we can measure that.</v>

274
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.260
<v Speaker 3>And when we measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see it,</v>

275
00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:33.261
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely flat and that's a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>unusual thing for it to be like,</v>

276
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it requires because what Einstein's</v>

277
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 3>theory says is that the shape of space</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the curvature of space and</v>

278
00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:43.910
<v Speaker 3>determined by the stuff that's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

279
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 3>that's basically Einstein's theory of</v>
<v Speaker 3>general relativity put stuff into space</v>

280
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 3>and it curves it and bends it in warp</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stretches it and so on.</v>

281
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 3>And what we find is that with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely the right amount of stuff in</v>

282
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 3>the universe to have a completely flat</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

283
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.001
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

284
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:02.540
<v Speaker 3>the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most favored explanation for that is</v>

285
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 3>university is way bigger than the piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can see.</v>

286
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like looking at a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

287
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Are you looking at little one Mile</v>
<v Speaker 3>Square of the earth?</v>

288
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's,</v>

289
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

290
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.230
<v Speaker 3>You have to look at big distances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of avoided the radius of the</v>

291
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 3>earth or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>

292
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 3>bigger than one kilometer anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on one mile to see the.</v>

293
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Actually you're on a curved surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the ideas about the</v>

294
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And white appears to be the way that it</v>

295
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>is because it's way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way bigger.</v>

296
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>So we were just looking at a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece and that's why it looks flat.</v>

297
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the ideas.</v>

298
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Now when you say flat like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brain doesn't understand this because</v>

299
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 3>from our perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look up at the Milky Way,</v>

300
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you see all these stars all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

301
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.090
<v Speaker 3>So if you're saying flat like a what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much height and what,</v>

302
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.400
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So terms of like the way to measure it,</v>

303
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 3>the best way to think about it is not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of three dimensions of space</v>

304
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.620
<v Speaker 3>because then we can't picture it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can think of to like this table</v>

305
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:04.280
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all right.</v>

306
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 3>We just forget the other one for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know what flat is on this</v>

307
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 3>table?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could define it.</v>

308
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.010
<v Speaker 3>So you could say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if I draw a triangle on the top of</v>

309
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 3>the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all the angles add up to 180</v>

310
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 3>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that actually defines flat.</v>

311
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.500
<v Speaker 3>If you did that on the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth with the big triangle,</v>

312
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.600
<v Speaker 3>then the angles wouldn't adopt 280</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees and all.</v>

313
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.000
<v Speaker 3>You could draw a circle and say what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pi?</v>

314
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 3>So Pi is the ratio of the circumference</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a circle to its diameter.</v>

315
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 3>That's only true on a flat surface is</v>
<v Speaker 3>different if the surface is curved.</v>

316
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 3>So you can define flatness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you.</v>

317
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 3>But when you're saying flatness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

318
00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 3>what is the height and what is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>width?</v>

319
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're talking about it as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a table,</v>

320
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there must be some sort of A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a dimension to it,</v>

321
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

322
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 3>There's a third dimension of space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the same applies.</v>

323
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just a generalization of geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then say you can pick fights.</v>

324
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 3>We can picture it in two dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can.</v>

325
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 3>You can draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can quite literally,</v>

326
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 3>you could imagine sending light beams</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and we do this measurement.</v>

327
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Actually we can look at the disc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most distant light we can see,</v>

328
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 3>which is something called the cosmic</v>
<v Speaker 3>microwave background radiation,</v>

329
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 3>which is if you imagine looking out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the Andromeda Galaxy,</v>

330
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 3>which we can see with the naked eye here</v>
<v Speaker 3>in la,</v>

331
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 3>you can see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the most distant object you can see</v>

332
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 3>with the naked eye and it's about two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million light years away or so,</v>

333
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 3>which means the light took 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>years to get to us.</v>

334
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 3>So it's a long way away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very big.</v>

335
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 3>So it as you look further out into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe to more and more distant</v>

336
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 3>galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking further back in time</v>

337
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 3>because you look at something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion light years away.</v>

338
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Then the light took a billion years to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to us.</v>

339
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 3>So you see it as it was a billion years</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the past and we can actually look so</v>

340
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:55.331
<v Speaker 3>far out that we can see almost back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 point 8 billion years ago,</v>

341
00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.620
<v Speaker 3>which is very close to the big bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can look to light.</v>

342
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 3>That began its journey before they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxies and that's the the oldest light</v>

343
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 3>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

344
00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:07.040
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

345
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.860
<v Speaker 3>one of the pieces of evidence from</v>
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>

346
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in the big bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer is,</v>

347
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:11.474
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see it.</v>

348
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just dare,</v>

349
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 3>you can see it.</v>

350
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:19.150
<v Speaker 3>We have pictures of it and that light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that there are such</v>

351
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 3>structures are ripples in that light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

352
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 3>which we can use as a ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So quite literally as a ruler on the</v>

353
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 3>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then because that light has been</v>

354
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:32.450
<v Speaker 3>traveling through the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can see how that rule has been</v>

355
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 3>distorted as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the lightest traveled through space.</v>

356
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.430
<v Speaker 3>And so we can infer where the space is</v>
<v Speaker 3>flat or curved or how it's warped,</v>

357
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 3>if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just from that measurement is the</v>

358
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 3>beautiful measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that in the future we'll</v>

359
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.350
<v Speaker 3>be able to see past 13 point 8 billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

360
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Not with light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because.</v>

361
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the picture is that before it's actually</v>

362
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.410
<v Speaker 3>released 300,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80,000 years after the big bang.</v>

363
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.700
<v Speaker 3>It's a very precise number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say.</v>

364
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 3>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

365
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.390
<v Speaker 3>before that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe was so hot,</v>

366
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 3>the atoms couldn't form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you had a soup of electrically</v>

367
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 3>charged particles if just too hot for</v>
<v Speaker 3>electrons to go into orbit around</v>

368
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Nuclei,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the universe was opaque to light,</v>

369
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>so you just couldn't.</v>

370
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like a big glowing star if you</v>

371
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.130
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when it was expanding,</v>

372
00:18:21.131 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 3>it cooled past the point where the atoms</v>
<v Speaker 3>could form and at that point it becomes</v>

373
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:30.411
<v Speaker 3>transparent really almost instantly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it cosmic time scale and so the light</v>

374
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:34.410
<v Speaker 3>could then travel in straight lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the universe and we can see that</v>

375
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 3>light so we see the light from that</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

376
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.350
<v Speaker 3>but further back than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's opaque.</v>

377
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 3>So you can't see past that with light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can potentially with</v>

378
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 3>gravitational waves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this measurement that got the</v>

379
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Nobel prize a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ligo experiment here in the United</v>

380
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 3>States and that seat looks for ripples</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fabric of space and time.</v>

381
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 3>And in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we had a big enough detector,</v>

382
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 3>you could see the ripples from the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>bang.</v>

383
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So you could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could take an image of the big</v>

384
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 3>bang in gravitational waves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will be,</v>

385
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.550
<v Speaker 3>but you need an enormous space based</v>
<v Speaker 3>detector that we're not gonna build</v>

386
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 3>anytime soon.</v>

387
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously this is all through equipment</v>

388
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 3>and technology that's been invented over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last few hundred years and</v>

389
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 3>perfected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that things could get</v>

390
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:26.511
<v Speaker 3>better and you could get some some</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to detect things even in a far</v>

391
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 3>more distant way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

392
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean the gravitational waves are</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

393
00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:36.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean Einstein predicted them in 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never thought they'd be detected because</v>

394
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:39.810
<v Speaker 3>you need such a high unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lasers for didn't have lasers,</v>

395
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 3>but they think Lygo this experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is half in a near Seattle in</v>

396
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 3>Washington state and half in Louisiana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they've got two detectors and they're</v>

397
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:53.541
<v Speaker 3>basically sort of a a no three mile long</v>
<v Speaker 3>laser beams and that just sit and</v>

398
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:59.880
<v Speaker 3>measure this of stretching and squashing</v>
<v Speaker 3>of space as the ripples in the fabric of</v>

399
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:03.180
<v Speaker 3>the universe to go through and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been observing.</v>

400
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Collisions of black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can imagine how extreme a</v>

401
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 3>colliding black holes.</v>

402
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 3>He said incredibly extreme event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it shakes the fabric of the universe</v>

403
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 3>and the referrals come across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and these laser beams,</v>

404
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Speaker 3>we should just basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rulers can detect it.</v>

405
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just vibrate as the referrals go through</v>

406
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.480
<v Speaker 3>in space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kip Thorne,</v>

407
00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 3>he got the Nobel prize last year for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the greatest living</v>

408
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 3>physicists I was signed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Describe it as a storm in time,</v>

409
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 3>so you've got this time to storm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful image.</v>

410
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 3>So that technology is incredible because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the change in length is that kind of</v>

411
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>been the exact number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's way,</v>

412
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.610
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way less than the diameter of an atomic</v>

413
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 3>nucleus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the change in length of the beams.</v>

414
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.820
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can do it.</v>

415
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 3>So this collision of black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you can detect that?</v>

416
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

417
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

418
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 3>I said the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first paper they published that two</v>

419
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:11.551
<v Speaker 3>black holes and they were about 30 times</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass of the sun each and they're all</v>

420
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:16.651
<v Speaker 3>beside each other and spiraling in</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards each other and they accelerated.</v>

421
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 3>At one point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were approaching each other at one</v>

422
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 3>third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light and the accelerated</v>

423
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 3>to two thirds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light in a 10th of a second</v>

424
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.590
<v Speaker 3>and now hit each other and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>explosion,</v>

425
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Speaker 3>the energy release was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm right,</v>

426
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:36.751
<v Speaker 3>it was something like 50 times the</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy release that the power of all the</v>

427
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:41.971
<v Speaker 3>stars in the observable universe glowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was something like 50 times and</v>

428
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 3>that of energy for a tiny fraction of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

429
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unimaginably violent event and</v>

430
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:54.691
<v Speaker 3>that's why our detectors can see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ripples that that makes in space and</v>

431
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:57.400
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we detected kind of it's two or</v>

432
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 3>three of them now and also two neutron</v>
<v Speaker 3>stars colliding.</v>

433
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>We saw that as well with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an incredible machine,</v>

434
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 3>which is why he got the Nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a supermassive black hole.</v>

435
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.400
<v Speaker 3>The center of every galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 3>There is also other black holes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't necessarily in the center of</v>

437
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 3>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these little ones were little,</v>

438
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.750
<v Speaker 3>a few times the mass of the sun and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from collapsed hours.</v>

439
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So they are stars at the end of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

440
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Very bigness and more massive than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sun,</v>

441
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 3>but they run out of their fuel and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>start to collapse because gravity</v>

442
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 3>squashes them and if they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently massive,</v>

443
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 3>then there's nothing that can stop the</v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse and so they collapse as far as</v>

444
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:41.890
<v Speaker 3>we know to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

445
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Essentially an infinitely dense point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know what happens that</v>

446
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.580
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what happened right in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle,</v>

447
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 3>but they collapsed to such an extent</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a region around it where</v>

448
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 3>from which light contest game and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a so nothing can escape and that that's</v>

449
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:02.860
<v Speaker 3>a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens to them?</v>

450
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Do they travel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moving through space?</v>

451
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll still stars.</v>

452
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.210
<v Speaker 3>So they're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're surrounded this region,</v>

453
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 3>wherever you fall in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the event horizon and if you</v>

454
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 3>go across that horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are going to the center.</v>

455
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 3>There's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite cool.</v>

456
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 3>Which is that at the time and space sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of flip is one way to think about it.</v>

457
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way that we are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the future now,</v>

458
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.410
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to tomorrow.</v>

459
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing we can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are going to tomorrow.</v>

460
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you fall in cross the event horizon</v>

461
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>of a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are going to the middle,</v>

462
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 3>the singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called,</v>

463
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.530
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your future.</v>

464
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every line of your future points to the</v>

465
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:52.580
<v Speaker 3>center of the black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of the ultimate of no</v>

466
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 3>escape for the ultimate prison.</v>

467
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.390
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get squashed to an</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinitely dense.</v>

468
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.840
<v Speaker 3>So point not every star becomes a black</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole at the end of its life now because</v>

469
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm sensing light the sun and we have</v>

470
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 3>a small stock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite small.</v>

471
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it collapses,</v>

472
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a sort of a pressure force if</v>

473
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is caused by the fact the</v>

474
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:19.970
<v Speaker 3>electrons don't like to be very close to</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>

475
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 3>so it's called the Paleo exclusion</v>
<v Speaker 3>principle,</v>

476
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 3>but essentially what happens is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says they get squashed closer and closer</v>

477
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They move faster and faster to get out</v>

478
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 3>of each of this way if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes a force which holds them</v>

479
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that creates what's called a</v>

480
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 3>white dwarf star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can have a blob of Matzoh.</v>

481
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 3>They're about the size of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're about the mass of the sun.</v>

482
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

483
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:47.630
<v Speaker 3>that's for smaller stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They end up as these white dwarf things</v>

484
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:52.631
<v Speaker 3>which are very dense objects as another</v>
<v Speaker 3>version which is called a neutron star,</v>

485
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.100
<v Speaker 3>which is the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for neutrons and they,</v>

486
00:24:56.101 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 3>they move faster and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it's,</v>

487
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.000
<v Speaker 3>if it's massive enough that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelms the electron thing,</v>

488
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.590
<v Speaker 3>then the electrons sort of crush into</v>
<v Speaker 3>protons and turned into neutrons.</v>

489
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 3>And the whole thing starts again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a neutron star can be,</v>

490
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elite one and a half times the mass of</v>

491
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.544
<v Speaker 3>the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

492
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.180
<v Speaker 3>But it can be about what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 miles across.</v>

493
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.660
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's an incredibly dense ball of</v>

494
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:24.140
<v Speaker 3>matter held up by this neutrons moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

495
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's got a fancy name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called Neutron degeneracy pressure</v>

496
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go even bigger than even that</v>

497
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 3>can't hold it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as far as we know them,</v>

498
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:35.600
<v Speaker 3>there's no known force that we know of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can hold,</v>

499
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.150
<v Speaker 3>hold the thing up if it's too massive.</v>

500
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 3>And so that's when it just almost winks</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of existence.</v>

501
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 3>If you like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it collapses and collapses and</v>

502
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 3>collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

503
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.600
<v Speaker 3>and that's when you get a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We try to put that into perspective of</v>

504
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Sun is a million times bigger than</v>

505
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the earth in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This neutron star is,</v>

506
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 3>would you say one and a half times the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass of the 10 miles wide?</v>

507
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

508
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's loads of those around them.</v>

509
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 3>They're called sales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we see those all over the place</v>

510
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.590
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one that was discovered was</v>

511
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 3>called LGM one because they're spinning</v>
<v Speaker 3>very fast.</v>

512
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was called lgm one because it's a</v>

513
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 3>very irregular pulse and they thought it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a little green men.</v>

514
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 3>So they called it kind of jokingly</v>
<v Speaker 3>little green men one.</v>

515
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

516
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen that there's one called the</v>

517
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 3>crab pulsar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is in the crab Nebula,</v>

518
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 3>which we saw the supernova explosion.</v>

519
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 3>So that's when a lot of the styles</v>
<v Speaker 3>explodes at the end of its life and then</v>

520
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 3>collapses to form a neutron star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we saw that in 10:54 add,</v>

521
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:41.490
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there some speculation that our</v>
<v Speaker 3>gout or our solar system at one point</v>

522
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.370
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

523
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.380
<v Speaker 3>it was a binary star system and that one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those stars had become a door.</v>

524
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

525
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone had said something about that in</v>

526
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the dense object they</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe is outside the Kuyper belt.</v>

527
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some evidence that the</v>

528
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 3>bits of evidence that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

529
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

530
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 3>And could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the periodic extinctions and</v>

531
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:09.470
<v Speaker 3>things on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get periodic bombardments from in</v>

532
00:27:09.471 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

533
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>histrionic extinctions.</v>

534
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

535
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 3>so figuring out like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

536
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 3>they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There had been mass extinctions on earth</v>

537
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.730
<v Speaker 3>when a lot of the life died and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what caused all those.</v>

538
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes there are impacts from space</v>

539
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 3>that seems clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

540
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 3>there are theories that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something over tonight which can disrupt</v>

541
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 3>all these objects are in the pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the belt that sends low to comets and</v>

542
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.920
<v Speaker 3>asteroids inwards to the inner solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and can cause a habit.</v>

543
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 3>And so there's some people look at those</v>
<v Speaker 3>theories.</v>

544
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.513
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

545
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a possibility that the same as the</v>

546
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 3>circulation was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's something out there is the,</v>

547
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something called the galactic shelf like</v>

548
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:59.850
<v Speaker 3>that it gets to a certain space and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates that there's something far</v>

549
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:01.940
<v Speaker 3>larger out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

550
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think,</v>

551
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the exact about the stellar</v>
<v Speaker 3>sized or mass objects out there.</v>

552
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there is some sort of</v>

553
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 3>suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is another planet out there,</v>

554
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.570
<v Speaker 3>big planet for example.</v>

555
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.320
<v Speaker 3>But you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can be the be stuff in way beyond</v>

556
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:21.360
<v Speaker 3>the bell and we talk in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

557
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 3>a light year away or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

558
00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Now it's interesting because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible the distance,</v>

559
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in our minds how far that must be</v>

560
00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:34.311
<v Speaker 3>out past what we used to call Pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason that becomes</v>

561
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 3>more interesting because it's in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>

562
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if they find some distant star</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and that it might have a planet</v>

563
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 3>similar to Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem as compelling for</v>

564
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 3>whatever weird reason now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

565
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the planets around Alpha Centuri</v>

566
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 3>approximate Centura,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the closest stars.</v>

567
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there are planets around</v>
<v Speaker 3>those now.</v>

568
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.820
<v Speaker 3>And then that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was interesting because we could</v>

569
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:02.550
<v Speaker 3>conceive of go in there and there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>

570
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you're Stephen Hawking actually and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>others at before he died,</v>

571
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 3>had this idea called breakthrough</v>
<v Speaker 3>starshot,</v>

572
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 3>which is the idea to send a little probe</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to at the center at the Alpha</v>

573
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.763
<v Speaker 3>Centura system.</v>

574
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in their view,</v>

575
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.050
<v Speaker 3>Yuri milner as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

576
00:29:18.051 --> 00:29:18.880
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

577
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entrepreneur wanting to do that.</v>

578
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.050
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

579
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think he said something like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>years traveled time or something with,</v>

580
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our current technology.</v>

581
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 3>And they pointed out that we don't do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now.</v>

582
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 3>We don't think a hundred years in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

583
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 3>but if you go back when people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>building cathedrals,</v>

584
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 3>people used to routinely start projects</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would take a hundred years to bear</v>

585
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 3>fruit and so we imagine going there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

586
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 3>That then becomes fascinating I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then you've got a solar system</v>

587
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 3>and know the solar system that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and visit conceivably.</v>

588
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Conceivably.</v>

589
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what kind of speed are we talking</v>

590
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.470
<v Speaker 4>and how long would it take to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

591
00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:57.861
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

592
00:29:57.861 --> 00:29:59.360
<v Speaker 4>so it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the,</v>

593
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.330
<v Speaker 4>the idea was about 100 years to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

594
00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.380
<v Speaker 4>so it's going four light years or so in</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 years or whatever that you would</v>

595
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.850
<v Speaker 4>have to essentially do what they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Ridley Scott Alien Film and put</v>

596
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 4>people into some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

597
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:14.420
<v Speaker 4>you're a robotic probe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be a.</v>

598
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.130
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be possible for a crew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it is,</v>

599
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.420
<v Speaker 4>but you have to freeze them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

600
00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:22.550
<v Speaker 4>That's always the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you touch your engineer's,</v>

601
00:30:22.551 --> 00:30:24.890
<v Speaker 4>you had Ilan and didn't use engineers</v>
<v Speaker 4>always say,</v>

602
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physicists go,</v>

603
00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:27.140
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's possible in principle,</v>

604
00:30:27.141 --> 00:30:30.740
<v Speaker 4>so over to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do it now there are no laws of</v>

605
00:30:30.741 --> 00:30:32.960
<v Speaker 4>physics that tells us we can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we just do it.</v>

606
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.550
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird relationship with</v>

607
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.200
<v Speaker 4>physics.</v>

608
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Physicists and engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

609
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

610
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.501
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

611
00:30:39.501 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 4>in principle you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can send a little robots facial</v>

612
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.630
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can send a crude spaceship.</v>

613
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:50.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm of the opinion as time goes on and</v>
<v Speaker 4>augmented and virtual reality gets</v>

614
00:30:50.361 --> 00:30:55.361
<v Speaker 4>better and better that it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally make sense unless we're talking</v>

615
00:30:55.821 --> 00:31:00.290
<v Speaker 4>about colonizing someplace to send</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological life to another planet and if</v>

616
00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:03.450
<v Speaker 4>we can send some probe that doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to worry about the,</v>

617
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biology being affected by radiation</v>

618
00:31:06.891 --> 00:31:09.440
<v Speaker 4>or by the speed of travel or even buy</v>
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>

619
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 4>we can send something out there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost be there by virtue of goggles,</v>

620
00:31:16.881 --> 00:31:19.160
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality goggles or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

621
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear that in science at the moment.</v>

622
00:31:23.371 --> 00:31:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Space Science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this debate alive actually</v>

623
00:31:25.411 --> 00:31:28.440
<v Speaker 3>because of course I'm space probes like</v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity.</v>

624
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:32.820
<v Speaker 3>That's on Mars at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really cheap compared to sending</v>

625
00:31:32.821 --> 00:31:36.600
<v Speaker 3>people to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so quite often the scientists who</v>

626
00:31:36.601 --> 00:31:38.370
<v Speaker 3>wants to find out about the world's will</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

627
00:31:38.371 --> 00:31:39.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should spend it on robots.</v>

628
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.930
<v Speaker 3>We shouldn't spend it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think crewed space exploration is in</v>

629
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.550
<v Speaker 3>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's clearly true at the moment</v>

630
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:52.190
<v Speaker 3>that humans can do more than robots so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can explore the place better for an</v>

631
00:31:52.191 --> 00:31:53.100
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

632
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.350
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it has to be.</v>

633
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.380
<v Speaker 3>It's about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's about.</v>

634
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about living and working off the</v>

635
00:32:03.781 --> 00:32:06.720
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is quite persuasive</v>

636
00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:07.471
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>

637
00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:09.900
<v Speaker 3>We've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already industrialized near Earth</v>

638
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 3>orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's already a multibillion dollar</v>

639
00:32:12.601 --> 00:32:14.910
<v Speaker 3>industry in every communication</v>
<v Speaker 3>satellites and weather satellites,</v>

640
00:32:14.911 --> 00:32:15.810
<v Speaker 3>gps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

641
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're already up there and so learning</v>

642
00:32:18.331 --> 00:32:22.770
<v Speaker 3>to live and work in space is I think a</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural extension of our,</v>

643
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.830
<v Speaker 3>of our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus the fact he taught,</v>

644
00:32:25.831 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 3>so Elon or Jeff Bezos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they point out that the amount of</v>

645
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:33.600
<v Speaker 3>resources available just slightly above</v>
<v Speaker 3>our heads is vast.</v>

646
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 3>And so I remember I talked to Jeff Bezos</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually once and he,</v>

647
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 3>he thinks really simply and he said</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe for example,</v>

648
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 3>in the asteroid belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough metal,</v>

649
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.240
<v Speaker 3>I think to build a skyscraper side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

650
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Something like 800 stories tall and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cover the earth in it,</v>

651
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.700
<v Speaker 3>right if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't want to dig that.</v>

652
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 3>But his point was that the energy from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun is all up there.</v>

653
00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 3>The resources are up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could almost imagine trying to</v>

654
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:05.320
<v Speaker 3>zone the earth residential at some point</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future to protect the planets.</v>

655
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 3>And do you have a industry off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

656
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these sound,</v>

657
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:13.850
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like science fiction except</v>
<v Speaker 3>that now space x and blue origin,</v>

658
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 3>those people have got reusable rockets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So suddenly the economics become</v>

659
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:19.470
<v Speaker 3>sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it,</v>

660
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think expansion is good and I think we</v>

661
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 3>will expand and I think we will expand</v>
<v Speaker 3>outwards because there's not much room</v>

662
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 3>left on this planet to expand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we'll do so.</v>

663
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 3>But that's a whole different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about gathering scientific</v>

664
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about a frontier.</v>

665
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.540
<v Speaker 3>And and all the benefits that come from</v>
<v Speaker 3>operating as a civilization on the</v>

666
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:45.710
<v Speaker 3>frontier which we have lost on the earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is no from to your left.</v>

667
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 3>And so I like that idea that Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk about Mars,</v>

668
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:53.960
<v Speaker 3>especially with Elon He's right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that's the only place you can go.</v>

669
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no other planet we can go to</v>

670
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 3>other than Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go to Jupiter or Saturn,</v>

671
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 3>mercury or Venus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we want to go somewhere and expand</v>

672
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 3>our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be mild and everything's there</v>

673
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Speaker 3>that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with that,</v>

674
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saying that you want to find out stuff,</v>

675
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we just want to find out stuff,</v>

676
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.220
<v Speaker 3>then you send robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as expanding actual</v>

677
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 3>civilization and bring you to another</v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

678
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that freaked me out as</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get depressed about living in</v>

679
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

680
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to live on Mars.</v>

681
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:29.830
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a horrendous thing is it's like</v>

682
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like the western front.</v>

683
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different here.</v>

684
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:36.330
<v Speaker 3>When people cross the states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly dangerous thing to do that</v>

685
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.400
<v Speaker 3>when across the states they still got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming and beautiful places in Colorado</v>

686
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

687
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was hard.</v>

688
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:44.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want it to do it.</v>

689
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 3>But once you got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a river and there's trout in the</v>

690
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 3>river and the metals are green and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with you.</v>

691
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not going to go there.</v>

692
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 3>So there were vineyards and hotels and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

693
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true that there are people he</v>

694
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 3>liked the challenge and what is true</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Mars?</v>

695
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.750
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting actually because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know something about the history of</v>

696
00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 3>miles now quite a lot about the history</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Mars and it's certainly clear that</v>

697
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 3>there was water almost certainly oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rivers,</v>

698
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 3>so and that water is almost certainly</v>
<v Speaker 3>still there.</v>

699
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 3>So I would say certainly still there</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have found large quantities</v>

700
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 3>of ice now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

701
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's certainly ice.</v>

702
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.520
<v Speaker 3>The may even be pockets of liquid water</v>
<v Speaker 3>below the surface somewhere.</v>

703
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>So couple that with all the minerals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the resources that we know are there and</v>

704
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:34.220
<v Speaker 3>you have everything you need.</v>

705
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's the thing about Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite nice relative to</v>

706
00:35:38.401 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 3>everywhere else other than the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go to Venus,</v>

707
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 3>you just metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

708
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:49.190
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred and something degrees and</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 atmospheric pressure as I said so,</v>

709
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Mars is quite nice but I wouldn't go</v>

710
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you because it's not</v>

711
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 3>gravity of Mars in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 3>third,</v>

712
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 3>third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think third,</v>

713
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

714
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it would still have a significant</v>

715
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 3>weakening effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you went to Mars and then</v>

716
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another in the future they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were able to get back to earth.</v>

717
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body would have a real problem with</v>

718
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:14.100
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right there is there is still grabbing.</v>

719
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit more than a third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't quite remember,</v>

720
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

721
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.400
<v Speaker 3>so there's still gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's gravity,</v>

722
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.000
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some protection from the that you'd</v>

723
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:27.590
<v Speaker 3>probably want to live in the caves</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually or something like that because</v>

724
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.460
<v Speaker 3>there's no magnetic field there.</v>

725
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.470
<v Speaker 3>So it's quite high radiation</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>

726
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:34.260
<v Speaker 3>but not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was further from the sun than we are.</v>

727
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.560
<v Speaker 3>It's not to the replaces a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a very deep critical helis which</v>

728
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:42.630
<v Speaker 3>has a big impact basin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the bottom,</v>

729
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.151
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

730
00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:46.170
<v Speaker 3>it's so deep you could fit everest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

731
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 3>So you put Mount Everest in the summit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Everest,</v>

732
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't reach the rim of the crater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it says something like,</v>

733
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven miles deep or six miles deep.</v>

734
00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 3>So you could go there and at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atmospheric pressure is so high that</v>

735
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:05.031
<v Speaker 3>you could just about have liquid water</v>
<v Speaker 3>on occasionally on the floor of that</v>

736
00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 3>crater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes it can be 20 degrees.</v>

737
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

738
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 3>the Celsius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

739
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so better than</v>

740
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.880
<v Speaker 3>experiencing a series called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

741
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it can be warmer than Minnesota.</v>

742
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>And so there are places where it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrendous on Mars.</v>

743
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

744
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 3>so the Martian is kind of really stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that sense,</v>

745
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 3>sort of bits of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch those movies and shake your</v>

746
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 3>head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

747
00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I like science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

748
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah.</v>

749
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 3>And I sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with star wars.</v>

750
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 3>That was my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was nine years old,</v>

751
00:37:42.441 --> 00:37:44.030
<v Speaker 3>list and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

752
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm not having this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

753
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Speaker 3>I did an argument with Neil degrasse</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tyson,</v>

754
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.140
<v Speaker 3>not an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a debate with him about lightsabers</v>

755
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 3>ones because I claimed that they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically the in principle they're</v>

756
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:56.230
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

757
00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.660
<v Speaker 3>and he was trying to say that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't,</v>

758
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.930
<v Speaker 3>but they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

759
00:37:58.931 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 3>they'd have to loop back around because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light's not continuing to like the</v>

760
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:05.490
<v Speaker 3>fact that it goes to a certain distance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pauses.</v>

761
00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to have a mirror or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

762
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that's pretty be the end of</v>

763
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:09.511
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

764
00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it wouldn't,</v>

765
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.070
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a different kind of lights</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

766
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 3>The only point I was making is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>photons,</v>

767
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.160
<v Speaker 3>particles of light can bounce off each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

768
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 3>So we see that in really high energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments in particle accelerators.</v>

769
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:26.460
<v Speaker 3>We can collide photons together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my point was a bit of a pedantic</v>

770
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:28.340
<v Speaker 3>physicists one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's because he.</v>

771
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.070
<v Speaker 3>It is true that light can bounce off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can hit light,</v>

772
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 3>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high energy.</v>

773
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.090
<v Speaker 3>But when they press that button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes</v>

774
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.130
<v Speaker 2>to a certain distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

775
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 2>that's engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

776
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

777
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 2>The distance thing doesn't mass to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

778
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So as you're swinging it around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have the leverage of a long</v>

779
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why not make it really long?</v>

780
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Because it wouldn't be difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>swing around.</v>

781
00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you could stab someone with a light</v>
<v Speaker 2>saber a mile away.</v>

782
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.220
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's just the laser in it.</v>

783
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why?</v>

784
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Why make it so short?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

785
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>You have to swing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be close to hitting a person</v>

786
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a silly,</v>

787
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.100
<v Speaker 2>silly design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are picking holes correctly in the</v>

788
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 2>engineering part of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only point I was making is that</v>

789
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we shut him.</v>

790
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:23.420
<v Speaker 2>He's quite interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it light can bounce off light.</v>

791
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

792
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:27.310
<v Speaker 2>but it would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would have to be something that</v>

793
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 2>causes it to stop at the very end.</v>

794
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

795
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which will be,</v>

796
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has merit,</v>

797
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:36.070
<v Speaker 2>but he wouldn't look cool with it if</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no kind of thing with them.</v>

798
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.320
<v Speaker 2>But what drives me crazy about star wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the light sabers.</v>

799
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.670
<v Speaker 2>It's the lasers when they're shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guns,</v>

800
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:45.340
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can I see that when I can't see</v>

801
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 2>bullets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is supposed to be way faster than a</v>

802
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 2>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is it easy to see this?</v>

803
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Because it's like you can get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

804
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Those things they really slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be so angry.</v>

805
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so dumb.</v>

806
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I could go warp speed in this Millennium</v>
<v Speaker 2>Falcon and travel the speed of light,</v>

807
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:07.090
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these lasers are so slow that you could</v>

808
00:40:07.091 --> 00:40:08.770
<v Speaker 2>duck out of the way of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so dumb.</v>

809
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's not only style loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes everything.</v>

810
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Every single film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>

811
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

812
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:19.090
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like also I worked on one of these films</v>

813
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.670
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunshine.</v>

814
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Very underappreciated movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

815
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's brilliant film,</v>

816
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>but in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

817
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.751
<v Speaker 2>they asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

818
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Danny said I want to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll do the spacecraft without any</v>

819
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it's traveling through space,</v>

820
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.550
<v Speaker 2>there'll be silent and it looks shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

821
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.940
<v Speaker 2>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same when when you try and fill</v>

822
00:40:40.941 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>the astronauts and you and they're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero g and they always move slowly.</v>

823
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

824
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

825
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be able to move very fast did you</v>

826
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it looks silly.</v>

827
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.830
<v Speaker 2>So this kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's what audiences have got</v>

828
00:40:53.831 --> 00:40:57.190
<v Speaker 2>used to over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in the end you have a</v>

829
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.750
<v Speaker 2>partner in 2001 which didn't do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>silent in 2001.</v>

830
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kubrick was a stickler for science and</v>

831
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:12.280
<v Speaker 2>for him he was apparently he would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex mathematics in his spare time.</v>

832
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy.</v>

833
00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That must have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

834
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

835
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone just found it.</v>

836
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Interview didn't idea of the day where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he explained the ending of 2001.</v>

837
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that it yesterday actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

838
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a really simple version</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

839
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.873
<v Speaker 2>He just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

840
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.390
<v Speaker 2>the super intelligent beings take him in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put him in a zoo basically,</v>

841
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:38.710
<v Speaker 2>and watch him grow old and then sending</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the earth as a super being.</v>

842
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst explanation at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 2001 I've ever heard,</v>

843
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but it was Kubrick's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what cubic said,</v>

844
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:49.210
<v Speaker 2>so that he falls into the monolith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:53.630
<v Speaker 2>They just put them in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a bad version of a</v>

846
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.680
<v Speaker 2>French chateau or something watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow old and then send him back to the</v>

847
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.460
<v Speaker 2>earth is a super being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

848
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was Kubrick's version.</v>

849
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

850
00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird genre,</v>

851
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes people get things</v>

852
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like didn't hg wells predict a,</v>

853
00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 2>a significant amount of scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventions in the future?</v>

854
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

855
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defenders.</v>

856
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Which one doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a moon one wasn't there.</v>

857
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:26.801
<v Speaker 2>He did an agenda to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's time machine is not able to</v>

858
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really worked out yet.</v>

859
00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

860
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I always liked science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like Arthur c Clarke a lot,</v>

861
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it is.</v>

862
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.380
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a form that you can let your</v>

863
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 2>imagination wander and address things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That restriction I think.</v>

864
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Did you like the alien series?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

865
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I leave when I was,</v>

866
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was at school,</v>

867
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:55.340
<v Speaker 2>he's 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>79 and we had a school film club and in</v>

868
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 2>the seventies they weren't like they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

869
00:42:56.871 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the first films they put on the</v>

870
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:01.760
<v Speaker 2>three films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 11 and it was alien,</v>

871
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse now in life of Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

872
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Which I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was my introduction to allow.</v>

873
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Well those are three great choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like really Scott's original</v>

874
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:16.220
<v Speaker 2>alien is probably one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror science fiction movies of all</v>

875
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:18.200
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my all time favorite movies.</v>

876
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.300
<v Speaker 2>But I really liked the newer ones as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

877
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Like I like promethium and I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>liked covenant.</v>

878
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.010
<v Speaker 2>The last one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

879
00:43:25.011 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 2>for ets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

880
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's not the best one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're trying to do with it.</v>

881
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of what the engineers</v>

882
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 2>coming back in time and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was disappointed with it</v>

883
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 2>because I thought the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opening is brilliant and I thought</v>

884
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:42.971
<v Speaker 2>this is just going to be brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it just lost its way and it</v>

885
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:45.860
<v Speaker 2>was a disappointment because it could</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been so brilliant.</v>

886
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

887
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The beginning was fantastic,</v>

888
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think covenant was more more</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting and.</v>

889
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also preposterous.</v>

890
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went to another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

891
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 2>The last thing you'd be doing is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing in the air.</v>

892
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we'd have to be really cool if</v>

893
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a life on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to be really careful than a.</v>

894
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 2>not to contaminate but be not to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated.</v>

895
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.263
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

897
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:10.383
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also.</v>

898
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is science fiction films</v>
<v Speaker 2>is gravity because you always give me an</v>

900
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:17.690
<v Speaker 2>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always just say the spaceships got</v>

901
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:21.890
<v Speaker 2>gravity again is only 2001.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right where everybody floats around.</v>

902
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all has a spinning thing.</v>

903
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.220
<v Speaker 2>The spaceship has gravity and then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you land the gravity's exactly like</v>

904
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:29.054
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's ridiculous.</v>

906
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been with what are the odds that</v>

907
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 3>you would find a planet that is exempt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even if a planet was one and a half</v>

908
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:40.920
<v Speaker 3>times the size of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have far more gravity.</v>

909
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.023
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

910
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.050
<v Speaker 3>that's really common for a planet to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just a little bit bigger.</v>

911
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 3>And then we will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck everywhere it'd be walking.</v>

912
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>We'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be getting crushed.</v>

913
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

914
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I suppose that's not the point.</v>

915
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 3>It's about ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

916
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Science class and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole idea where you just supposed</v>

917
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 3>to let it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let the,</v>

918
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let the story play out and.</v>

919
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sunshine was um,</v>

920
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

921
00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 3>the premise is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is silly.</v>

922
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the premise is the son is dying and</v>

923
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go and fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

924
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.403
<v Speaker 3>Both of those things.</v>

925
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:20.160
<v Speaker 3>It fails on its first line in incentive</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

926
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that it's not about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

927
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about the,</v>

928
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 3>it's about the sun as a god in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

929
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:33.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's about our response to the power</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature and it's about day fighting</v>

930
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 3>this thing and worshiping it and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately you go mad if you remember</v>

931
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:39.260
<v Speaker 3>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pin backer,</v>

932
00:45:39.261 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 3>who's the first captain that went to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>captain,</v>

933
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:43.680
<v Speaker 3>the first mission to go and restart the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sun,</v>

934
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 3>which is the mad bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then became a religious</v>

935
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:51.450
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then decided it's a fascinating idea</v>

936
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 3>that he decides to to bring meaning to</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life.</v>

937
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.370
<v Speaker 3>He will become the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last man,</v>

938
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 3>the last human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he wants to be the lest he wants</v>

939
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:06.441
<v Speaker 3>the son to die and he wants to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity with it and he decided to make</v>

940
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:08.100
<v Speaker 3>that happen.</v>

941
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So he stays there waiting for the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>ship.</v>

942
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 3>And I like those ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

943
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your reaction to the power of</v>

944
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:18.690
<v Speaker 3>nature this afternoon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the thing to do my shows,</v>

945
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being a commercial person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just thought of it.</v>

946
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Speaker 3>One of the great things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmologies that it is terrifying in</v>

947
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:27.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the truest sense of the word mean.</v>

948
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 3>We talked a bit about the size and scale</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe and black holes</v>

949
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 3>colliding and those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

950
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:38.390
<v Speaker 3>it is very frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the I think the act of trying</v>

951
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:45.490
<v Speaker 3>to understand our place in nature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the size and scale of the universe and</v>

952
00:46:45.491 --> 00:46:50.491
<v Speaker 3>now our tiny presence within it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>

953
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a so that you can be terrified but</v>

954
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 3>also inspired and interested and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of if you want to find,</v>

955
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.090
<v Speaker 3>if you want to ask questions about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means to be human and means to be</v>

956
00:47:03.091 --> 00:47:06.300
<v Speaker 3>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I think you find the answers in</v>

957
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 3>confronting that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that we live in a terrifyingly</v>

958
00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 3>vast universe.</v>

959
00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the powers in the universe that we</v>

960
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:17.270
<v Speaker 3>cannot comprehend as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

961
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.950
<v Speaker 3>that that's what you've got to face</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's reality,</v>

962
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:24.080
<v Speaker 3>so you can't hide your head in the sand</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just duck it and it sends them.</v>

963
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 3>It can send some people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it is really interesting that</v>

964
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:33.351
<v Speaker 3>we need that suspension of disbelief in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to sort of make a film on space.</v>

965
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.950
<v Speaker 3>You almost have to like go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this isn't really how it would be,</v>

966
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.330
<v Speaker 3>but this is how you have to make it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to fit it into a two hour movie.</v>

967
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the film as we sunshine becomes</v>

968
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:48.300
<v Speaker 3>about your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can have the film about</v>

969
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.490
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

970
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really that well.</v>

971
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Did you like a event horizon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

972
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I did actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's ridiculous.</v>

973
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I always wanted to ask about</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

974
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:05.370
<v Speaker 3>their concept of propulsion that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like space would be flat,</v>

975
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 3>you would fold space over and you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>intersect those two points and you'd be</v>

976
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 3>able to travel vast distances</v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously.</v>

977
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm doing a terrible job of</v>

978
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:14.770
<v Speaker 3>explaining it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

979
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.610
<v Speaker 3>But is that a concept that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually considered?</v>

980
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can in general relativity.</v>

981
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.740
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Einstein,</v>

982
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.670
<v Speaker 3>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it is Einstein's theory of general</v>

983
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 3>relativity is our best theory of space</v>
<v Speaker 3>and time and so it really is,</v>

984
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 3>as we've talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you imagine space and time as a</v>

985
00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine it as a thing,</v>

986
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 3>literally a sheet surface and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory says is that if you put matter</v>

987
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.030
<v Speaker 3>and or energy into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it curves it and distort it and it</v>

988
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 3>can stretch it and make it shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's the response of space and</v>

989
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 3>time to matter and energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>

990
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the simplest version will be the sun.</v>

991
00:48:56.231 --> 00:49:01.120
<v Speaker 3>So you put the big spherical ball of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in there and it warp space and</v>

992
00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 3>time searched at the nice straight</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

993
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 3>something just traveling minute.</v>

994
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 3>So in business through that warp space</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns into an orbit and that's why you</v>

995
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.860
<v Speaker 3>can actually kind of see things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the sun.</v>

996
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:15.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so light bends around the sun because</v>

997
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.860
<v Speaker 3>it's just traveling through the curved</v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

998
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.620
<v Speaker 3>The earth goes around the sun because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just rolling,</v>

999
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 3>minding its own business through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>curve space.</v>

1000
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 3>So an example would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

1001
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:29.550
<v Speaker 3>well how does curb space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can connect,</v>

1002
00:49:29.551 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 3>give rise to something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a force,</v>

1003
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.510
<v Speaker 3>which is gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the best analogy I know of is to</v>

1004
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:38.200
<v Speaker 3>think of walking around on the surface</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the earth to be stand on the equator</v>

1005
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 3>of the earth and you with your friend</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say,</v>

1006
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:44.020
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to set off,</v>

1007
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 3>let's say we're a thousand miles apart</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the equator and we're gonna walk due</v>

1008
00:49:47.681 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 3>north and what's going to happen?</v>

1009
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 3>So you walk in straight lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't change direction,</v>

1010
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 3>you don't do any accelerating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the straight lines and lines of</v>

1011
00:49:55.511 --> 00:49:59.680
<v Speaker 3>longitude on the surface of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you go further and further north,</v>

1012
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.620
<v Speaker 3>you get closer and closer together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he carried onto the pole.</v>

1013
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:06.770
<v Speaker 3>You bump into each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing's happened and no one's no</v>

1014
00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no forces acting.</v>

1015
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 3>It's just that you're moving on a curved</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface and so you get closer.</v>

1016
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically Einstein's theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>of general relativity.</v>

1017
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I start talking about event</v>

1018
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.730
<v Speaker 3>horizon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of a full.</v>

1019
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1020
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 3>so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all you have to do,</v>

1021
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 3>so those folded kinds of geometries is</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to try and specify hat where</v>

1022
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you would put the matter and what kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff you'd put there to make the</v>

1023
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 3>geometry fold in that way.</v>

1024
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it so you can.</v>

1025
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You can write down that geometry is</v>
<v Speaker 3>called a warp drive.</v>

1026
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Geometry I think is called that is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>textbooks.</v>

1027
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 3>So you can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To have a warp drive.</v>

1028
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 3>The question becomes what sorts of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you have to actually put into the</v>

1029
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:54.800
<v Speaker 3>real universe to make it warp in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1030
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 3>And it always usually turns out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the kind of stuff that doesn't</v>

1031
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has properties.</v>

1032
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Is Matt sort of matter or sort of energy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has properties that do not exist in</v>

1033
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:10.490
<v Speaker 3>nature as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can still write the geometry</v>

1034
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:13.600
<v Speaker 3>down in Einstein's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you had the sadness,</v>

1035
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 3>guilt force or mass or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had that stuff that doesn't</v>

1036
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a concept that.</v>

1037
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the geometry exists is so you can.</v>

1038
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it and you can do the</v>

1039
00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 3>calculations and you can see the walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive,</v>

1040
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 3>you can construct wormholes that connect</v>
<v Speaker 3>distant regions of the universe,</v>

1041
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 3>which you could use as time machines and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do all that in the theory,</v>

1042
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 3>but in nature you'd have to have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right stuff to do it,</v>

1043
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.070
<v Speaker 3>but that stuff is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be as far as we know now</v>

1044
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:47.240
<v Speaker 3>what would have to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would have to have enough power</v>

1045
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:50.730
<v Speaker 3>or mass to be able to fold those two</v>
<v Speaker 3>things together.</v>

1046
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:53.420
<v Speaker 3>It tends to be weird stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1047
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 3>stuff that has a negative pressure or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1048
00:51:57.201 --> 00:52:02.201
<v Speaker 3>So stuff that has physical properties</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just bizarre and that no matter</v>

1049
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 3>or energy that we know of in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe has so that to make,</v>

1050
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 3>to make the geometry happen.</v>

1051
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:14.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's conceivable in theory that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>could exist even though it doesn't.</v>

1052
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1053
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it's a dba ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1054
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.840
<v Speaker 3>so wormholes that a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would be quite literally it.</v>

1055
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 3>We talked about the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1056
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 3>So you fly to Australia from La and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go quite a long way around the</v>

1057
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 3>edge of the earth or you could turn or</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight through and get there quicker.</v>

1058
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.090
<v Speaker 3>So you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a word.</v>

1059
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's got a little graphic up there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there it is.</v>

1060
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 3>So you could go all the way around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>edge or you could take the shortcut.</v>

1061
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.900
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can do that in theory,</v>

1062
00:52:44.901 --> 00:52:47.390
<v Speaker 3>you can write down that geometry and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

1063
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 3>So the first question is can you make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1064
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.850
<v Speaker 3>And as we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't think that stuff exists.</v>

1065
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a second set of theoretical bits</v>
<v Speaker 3>of theoretical work,</v>

1066
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 3>which if you had a worm hole then what</v>
<v Speaker 3>would happen if you tried to travel</v>

1067
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:07.061
<v Speaker 3>through it and what seems to happen is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is that they become unstable the</v>

1068
00:53:08.631 --> 00:53:10.460
<v Speaker 3>moment anything tries to go through.</v>

1069
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.120
<v Speaker 3>So you get kind of a feedback of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through and through and through</v>

1070
00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 3>and through and so it collapses and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great.</v>

1071
00:53:17.121 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book by Kip Thorne</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually we just mentioned him.</v>

1072
00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 3>He got the Nobel Prize last year for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitational waves and he wrote a</v>

1073
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 3>brilliant book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in the eighties called black</v>

1074
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 3>holes and time warps way talks about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1075
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:34.230
<v Speaker 3>The answer is we don't fully know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most physicists thing that even if</v>

1076
00:53:34.231 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 3>they existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be unstable and as soon as you</v>

1077
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 3>even tried to transmit information</v>
<v Speaker 3>through them,</v>

1078
00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.330
<v Speaker 3>send a bit of light through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there will be sought feedback and</v>

1079
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 3>they'd collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately the reason we don't</v>

1080
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 3>really know absolutely is because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need what's called a quantum theory of</v>

1081
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:54.171
<v Speaker 3>gravity and we don't have one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we don't have the theoretical tools</v>

1082
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:59.040
<v Speaker 3>to be absolutely sure that these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be unstable or don't exist in</v>

1083
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we strongly suspect that they don't.</v>

1084
00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 3>If they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could build a time machine.</v>

1085
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So there Stephen Hawking wrote a paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the chronology protection</v>

1086
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:11.130
<v Speaker 3>conjecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1087
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 3>and conjectures the important word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

1088
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 3>at the conjecture basically was that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>laws of nature will be such that you</v>

1089
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 3>can't have stable wormholes and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't build time machines.</v>

1090
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.610
<v Speaker 3>And if you send something through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would destabilize it.</v>

1091
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 3>And if it didn't destabilize it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would your physical body deal with</v>

1092
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 3>the stress of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1093
00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can build them.</v>

1094
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.860
<v Speaker 3>That's called the tidal gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>

1095
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:40.930
<v Speaker 3>So it's the difference in gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull across your body because you.</v>

1096
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that gets you to fall</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a black hole,</v>

1097
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 3>so before you actually get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>singularity you can get is called</v>

1098
00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Spaghetti fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get there and it's just like the</v>

1099
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 3>moon's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the tidal effects on the earth,</v>

1100
00:54:53.431 --> 00:54:56.820
<v Speaker 3>which is quite small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still raised hides on the</v>

1101
00:54:56.821 --> 00:54:57.654
<v Speaker 3>oceans.</v>

1102
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 3>So that can be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about something like a</v>

1103
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 3>black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be any massive difference in</v>

1104
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:05.850
<v Speaker 3>gravitational pull from your head to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet.</v>

1105
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.150
<v Speaker 3>And so it can stretch you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what you can with wormholes you,</v>

1106
00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:13.230
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can write the geometry down the</v>

1107
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 3>United States theory such that you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through so you don't have to be</v>

1108
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.800
<v Speaker 3>destroyed or anything weird happened to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1109
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Would you have to have some something</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting you?</v>

1110
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Some force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1111
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just literally eat,</v>

1112
00:55:26.201 --> 00:55:27.770
<v Speaker 3>fall through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's so,</v>

1113
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.500
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were,</v>

1114
00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they exist.</v>

1115
00:55:31.021 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 3>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go through,</v>

1116
00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 3>you sit in a little spaceship but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1117
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.540
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing inherently in them that</v>

1118
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:42.330
<v Speaker 3>says that you will be ripped apart or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

1119
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:48.170
<v Speaker 3>But what are your thoughts on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on alien life,</v>

1120
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 3>on life outside of this planet as</v>
<v Speaker 3>something you think about?</v>

1121
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there must be.</v>

1122
00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:00.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm even in the solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not be surprised if we find</v>

1123
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 3>microbes on Mars are sort of the moons</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Jupiter or Saturn where there's</v>

1124
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 3>liquid water like Europa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1125
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 3>and the reason is that if you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1126
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:13.350
<v Speaker 3>The reason I think that guests is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you look at the history of</v>

1127
00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:17.210
<v Speaker 3>life on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then so earth formed and it was just a.</v>

1128
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.910
<v Speaker 3>There was no life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a ball of rock an almost.</v>

1129
00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 3>As soon as it cooled down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see evidence of life.</v>

1130
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 3>So certainly three point 8 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

1131
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 3>possibly even further back than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see evidence of life on earth.</v>

1132
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 3>So somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>geochemistry,</v>

1133
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.740
<v Speaker 3>active geochemistry became biochemistry</v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth and we have some idea,</v>

1134
00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

1135
00:56:42.881 --> 00:56:47.881
<v Speaker 3>if you get a gradient of temperature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>acid and alkaline and the conditions</v>

1136
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 3>that are naturally present on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surface of oceans,</v>

1137
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 3>then complex carbon chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 3>spontaneously happens.</v>

1138
00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 3>So we have a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that life almost certainly we</v>

1139
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 3>know that life began on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the other opportunity came from</v>

1140
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 3>space or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but probably didn't really properly</v>

1141
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 3>began on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that means that at least here</v>

1142
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.490
<v Speaker 3>that happened and we know that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions that lead to the origin of</v>

1143
00:57:15.491 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 3>life on earth were present a miles three</v>
<v Speaker 3>point eight,</v>

1144
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 3>4 billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that they're present on</v>

1145
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 3>Europa today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't see that there's anything</v>

1146
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:30.300
<v Speaker 3>special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is just chemistry and it and the,</v>

1147
00:57:30.301 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 3>the idea that geochemistry becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry's not fanciful because it</v>

1148
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:37.810
<v Speaker 3>happened here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that given the same</v>

1149
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:40.900
<v Speaker 3>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be surprising to me at the same</v>

1150
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:44.440
<v Speaker 3>thing didn't happen in that life begins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1151
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:46.900
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the two tests.</v>

1152
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the great frontiers of</v>
<v Speaker 3>science now,</v>

1153
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 3>which one of the great challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why another reason we're</v>

1154
00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 3>interested in Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we know those conditions where</v>

1155
00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know there were what's called</v>

1156
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 3>hydrothermal vent systems on the floors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have oceans on Mars,</v>

1157
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:03.820
<v Speaker 3>three point eight or 4 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

1158
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 3>So it will be good to know what I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>said is right and the way we find out is</v>

1159
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:11.410
<v Speaker 3>to find life or evidence of past life.</v>

1160
00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Are you aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1161
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.410
<v Speaker 4>the speculation that was going around</v>
<v Speaker 4>with how recent was it that occupy</v>

1162
00:58:18.411 --> 00:58:19.244
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1163
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1164
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.700
<v Speaker 4>the octopus eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1165
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 4>there was a group of scientists that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were speculating that it's Panspermia</v>

1166
00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:32.240
<v Speaker 4>the idea of Panspermia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's possible that Octopi had come</v>

1167
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:36.810
<v Speaker 4>from somewhere else and frozen eggs had</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually come from somewhere else and</v>

1168
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.230
<v Speaker 4>landed on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these are like legitimate scientists</v>

1169
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.170
<v Speaker 4>are contemplating not morons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've seen this,</v>

1170
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.710
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1171
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it.</v>

1172
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:48.410
<v Speaker 4>So panspermia doesn't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>unlikely.</v>

1173
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:49.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1174
00:58:49.131 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 4>you might have seen the other day we</v>
<v Speaker 4>found an earth rock on the mood.</v>

1175
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.401
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1176
00:58:52.401 --> 00:58:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Well they'll back on this now because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>apollo astronauts brought it back in the</v>

1177
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:58.720
<v Speaker 4>4 billion years old or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the oldest rocks ever found.</v>

1178
00:58:58.721 --> 00:58:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1179
00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:00.590
<v Speaker 4>So we know that material</v>

1180
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 3>transfer between planets and so it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>inconceivable that microbes could</v>

1181
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 3>survive that journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1182
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.150
<v Speaker 3>We know that microbes can survive in</v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

1183
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.330
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that isn't mad.</v>

1184
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 3>It's probably unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not mad.</v>

1185
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.500
<v Speaker 3>But with the octopus I hadn't heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1186
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is that the octopus is</v>
<v Speaker 3>still extremely biologically</v>

1187
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the difference is negligible,</v>

1188
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 2>so it's still got the same energy system</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a single ATP and DNA and all that</v>

1189
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all very,</v>

1190
00:59:30.591 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 2>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something about rna and DNA.</v>

1191
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Did you find that out?</v>

1192
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:36.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm looking at a different one from a</v>

1193
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:37.860
<v Speaker 5>different website.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about the same thing.</v>

1194
00:59:37.861 --> 00:59:42.390
<v Speaker 5>It has to do with the Cambrian explosion</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there were 33 authors on a paper</v>

1195
00:59:42.391 --> 00:59:47.391
<v Speaker 5>that got published and the progress and</v>
<v Speaker 5>in biophysics and molecular biology that</v>

1196
00:59:47.611 --> 00:59:50.100
<v Speaker 5>talked about this possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are other people that disagree</v>

1197
00:59:50.101 --> 00:59:50.934
<v Speaker 5>with it though.</v>

1198
00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the,</v>

1199
00:59:52.111 --> 00:59:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's unlikely because the</v>

1200
00:59:54.811 --> 00:59:58.500
<v Speaker 2>octopus is extremely similar to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that suggests a common origin.</v>

1201
00:59:58.501 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 2>To me that's a pose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cancer argument you could,</v>

1202
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.060
<v Speaker 2>you could advance would be there's only</v>
<v Speaker 2>one way to do life,</v>

1203
01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.960
<v Speaker 2>so you could say the actually given</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the laws of physics and</v>

1204
01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:14.340
<v Speaker 2>chemistry the same everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it's maybe DNA,</v>

1205
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.210
<v Speaker 2>which is the only way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the way it gets done.</v>

1206
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Which is why they're so similar to us is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so alien as well.</v>

1207
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not though,</v>

1208
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

1209
01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.780
<v Speaker 2>If not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I'm surprised about</v>

1210
01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:30.210
<v Speaker 2>because they're not that alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very similar.</v>

1211
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>While they're in their abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to transform their texture</v>

1212
01:00:35.371 --> 01:00:37.830
<v Speaker 2>and their color instant almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously.</v>

1213
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.300
<v Speaker 2>They have incredible camouflage</v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities that really don't exist in the</v>

1214
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.770
<v Speaker 2>mammalian world.</v>

1215
01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on a cellular level,</v>

1216
01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:48.390
<v Speaker 2>you look at Knox for sell in among under</v>
<v Speaker 2>a microscope and you wouldn't be able to</v>

1217
01:00:48.391 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>sell the treating not for selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1218
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>So the only way that that would make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense as if all life comes from</v>

1219
01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:58.350
<v Speaker 2>basically the same kind of building</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks and just varies depending upon</v>

1220
01:00:58.351 --> 01:01:00.850
<v Speaker 2>the conditions and where it takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1221
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

1222
01:01:02.221 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that must be the.</v>

1223
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:06.930
<v Speaker 2>The only way you could sustain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that they're so similar to us</v>

1224
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 2>because they really are biochemically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that's the only way it can be</v>

1225
01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:15.990
<v Speaker 2>done given the given the building block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toolkit,</v>

1226
01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>the laws of nature and the elements and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on that we have in our universe,</v>

1227
01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.290
<v Speaker 2>we have so many different life forms on</v>
<v Speaker 2>our planet,</v>

1228
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:26.490
<v Speaker 2>but if we found anything that's remotely</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to what we have here on earth,</v>

1229
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>on another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be such an incredible</v>

1230
01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>discovery.</v>

1231
01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Like we sat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found a frog on the moon.</v>

1232
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean the world would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1233
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I'd be very surprised if we found</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything anywhere that is any,</v>

1234
01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>in any way similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An insect on Mars.</v>

1235
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

1236
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

1237
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.820
<v Speaker 2>it'd be micro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think every single celled things</v>

1238
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:48.690
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you mentioned the Cambrian</v>

1239
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that is that.</v>

1240
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:52.830
<v Speaker 2>What we do know that earth is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>although life began,</v>

1241
01:01:52.831 --> 01:01:54.570
<v Speaker 2>let's say three point 8 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1242
01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.080
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't until around 600 million years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago or so,</v>

1243
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that maybe most 700 that you see any</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex multicellular organisms at all.</v>

1244
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So if there's something like 3 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1245
01:02:07.921 --> 01:02:12.921
<v Speaker 2>it was single celled alone and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I would guess if</v>

1246
01:02:14.011 --> 01:02:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that microbes would be</v>

1247
01:02:16.021 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>common because life began very quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>on earth and I wouldn't be surprised to</v>

1248
01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:20.060
<v Speaker 2>find</v>

1249
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.440
<v Speaker 3>finding on Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but complex life,</v>

1250
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 3>multicellular life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insects,</v>

1251
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.480
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

1252
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I would guess will be very rare because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took so long on earth to get there</v>

1253
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.320
<v Speaker 3>and you just slime bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three billion years of slime.</v>

1254
01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On what happened?</v>

1255
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.570
<v Speaker 3>How did it go from slime?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two giraffes.</v>

1256
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:49.010
<v Speaker 3>It's very quickly once he wanted to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and it's one of the great unsolved</v>

1257
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:54.780
<v Speaker 3>mysteries in biology that one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is true is that we seem to be all</v>

1258
01:02:54.781 --> 01:02:58.100
<v Speaker 3>complex creatures seemed to be and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were called.</v>

1259
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:01.170
<v Speaker 3>You carry it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writers yourselves with the cell nucleus</v>

1260
01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 3>and all that kind of stuff and they look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're the merger between two</v>

1261
01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:10.491
<v Speaker 3>simpler life forms of bacteria and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing called an archaic and okay,</v>

1262
01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 3>and so it looks like somewhere in 2</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago,</v>

1263
01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some ocean,</v>

1264
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:22.730
<v Speaker 3>the bacteria cell got inside the arcane</v>
<v Speaker 3>and survived as,</v>

1265
01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:29.241
<v Speaker 3>as a symbiotic organism essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then somehow unbelievably managed to</v>

1266
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.180
<v Speaker 3>reproduce and replicate in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>configuration and that does seem to be</v>

1267
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:38.640
<v Speaker 3>the origin of all complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multicellular life on earth.</v>

1268
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 3>So it's called a fateful encounter</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>

1269
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.180
<v Speaker 3>And if that's true then it's just a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of luck and it happened once.</v>

1270
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we're here now when blind</v>

1271
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:55.570
<v Speaker 3>look considerably like how many billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth like planets did you say exists</v>

1272
01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 3>just in our sources to the alone in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>galaxy?</v>

1273
01:03:57.781 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 3>20 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1274
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 3>So one in 10 styles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the odds of complex life out of our</v>

1275
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 3>incredibly fortunate situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the odds of that occurring on any of</v>

1276
01:04:08.941 --> 01:04:11.610
<v Speaker 3>these billions of other planets that</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>

1277
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:15.030
<v Speaker 3>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's say the earth is.</v>

1278
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it was under the fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1279
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're,</v>

1280
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about give or take 4</v>

1281
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 3>billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1282
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 3>And the origin of life to now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have a civilization now and we've</v>

1283
01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.760
<v Speaker 3>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our species has been around what,</v>

1284
01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 3>a quarter of a million years or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1285
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:31.920
<v Speaker 3>So it's just now basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say 4 billion is on the</v>

1286
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 3>fortunate side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that it was double that or</v>

1287
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.390
<v Speaker 3>triple that on the average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly that's the age of the universe,</v>

1288
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a third of the age of the</v>

1289
01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how many of those worlds had been</v>

1290
01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:50.331
<v Speaker 3>stable for three or 4 billion years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's quite a tall order actually.</v>

1291
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:56.430
<v Speaker 3>It looks like our solar system might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite unusual in that respect that</v>

1292
01:04:56.431 --> 01:04:59.100
<v Speaker 3>because they had the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to remain stable in a stable</v>

1293
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:01.710
<v Speaker 3>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stars got to remain stable.</v>

1294
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.710
<v Speaker 3>System stabilizes at Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plays a big role.</v>

1295
01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Takes of treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1296
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>socks and soap and that you know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing.</v>

1297
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 3>There's a theory called the grand tack</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>

1298
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.560
<v Speaker 3>which is very hard to explain the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution of our solar system so that</v>

1299
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 3>when you do compete a models of solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

1300
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:27.070
<v Speaker 3>you don't tend to get for rocky planets</v>
<v Speaker 3>too close to the sun and for big gas</v>

1301
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:27.460
<v Speaker 3>giants.</v>

1302
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Further out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the current best theories,</v>

1303
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 3>and this I say this because it shows you</v>
<v Speaker 3>how lucky we might be,</v>

1304
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:38.740
<v Speaker 3>is that Jeff said that they tend to form</v>
<v Speaker 3>these big gas Jane's and migrate inwards</v>

1305
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 3>towards the Star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in almost all the computer</v>

1306
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 3>simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because you got this big gas giant</v>

1307
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 3>obits and all the dust around this star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tend to drop in woods and it looks</v>

1308
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:51.790
<v Speaker 3>like Jupiter did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like it formed and came in</v>

1309
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:57.120
<v Speaker 3>and came in almost to where Mars orbitz</v>
<v Speaker 3>today and cleared out the region around</v>

1310
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Mars actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is maybe the reason Mars is so</v>

1311
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:02.800
<v Speaker 3>small compared to the other to Venus and</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1312
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 3>But then Saturn was coming in as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the computer models.</v>

1313
01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:12.901
<v Speaker 3>The interaction between Jupiter and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturn Stop Jupiter coming in before it</v>

1314
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 3>gets to the earth.</v>

1315
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:19.390
<v Speaker 3>And they both get dragged out again and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to where they are today and so,</v>

1316
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:22.000
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to be,</v>

1317
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:24.610
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the best theories for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution of our solar system.</v>

1318
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:29.940
<v Speaker 3>So what are the chances that the chances</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that are so many skill?</v>

1319
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 3>My tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the thing I think about these</v>

1320
01:06:34.481 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Speaker 3>rocky planets in order to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization on them.</v>

1321
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you need quite unusual solar</v>

1322
01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:47.281
<v Speaker 3>systems that will be a guest and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need quite unusual stability on the</v>

1323
01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:49.810
<v Speaker 3>planet for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for billions of years.</v>

1324
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I think we might be quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>

1325
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how does bodes law work?</v>

1326
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Bodes laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a method of detecting if you look at the</v>

1327
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 3>mass of a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can accurately detect how much mass</v>

1328
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 3>and the size of a neighboring planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it wasn't just the,</v>

1329
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:09.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physicians of the obits I think</v>

1330
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.073
<v Speaker 3>we're in.</v>

1331
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1332
01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.100
<v Speaker 3>it's one thing that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our solar system is that you,</v>

1333
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:20.590
<v Speaker 3>if you get the computer simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't put more planets in to try and</v>

1334
01:07:20.591 --> 01:07:21.550
<v Speaker 3>fill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put more planets.</v>

1335
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.860
<v Speaker 3>And they become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes unstable very quickly.</v>

1336
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.600
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass of like,</v>

1337
01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:30.601
<v Speaker 3>if you measure Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can accurately depict where the next</v>

1338
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.450
<v Speaker 3>planet close to it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1339
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.180
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1340
01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that's what was done was at 17th century</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

1341
01:07:37.301 --> 01:07:39.610
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember his along yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just one of those things where,</v>

1342
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:42.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pattern and they were just trying</v>

1343
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a pattern which is,</v>

1344
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:46.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1345
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to that really other</v>

1346
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:54.340
<v Speaker 3>than to say that most simulations of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>solar system,</v>

1347
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.740
<v Speaker 3>if there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you put other planet saying they tend</v>

1348
01:07:56.741 --> 01:08:00.010
<v Speaker 3>to get thrown out by gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions.</v>

1349
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 3>So there is a sense in which our solar</v>
<v Speaker 3>system has got as much stuff in it as it</v>

1350
01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 3>could have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the planets and nicely spaced and</v>

1351
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.290
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given the massive them,</v>

1352
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:12.250
<v Speaker 3>that depends on how close to the planet</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be before the interaction goes</v>

1353
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it gets thrown out into the</v>

1354
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.290
<v Speaker 3>intergalactic space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>

1355
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Because planets do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1356
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that planets get thrown out of</v>

1357
01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 3>solar systems by gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions.</v>

1358
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1359
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:28.370
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it points to the fact that solar systems</v>

1360
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 3>are not a not stable over long periods</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

1361
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:36.710
<v Speaker 3>They're not like clockwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things not like Newtonian clockwork and</v>

1362
01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:39.100
<v Speaker 3>it just goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like that,</v>

1363
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:44.270
<v Speaker 3>that they evolve and planets can shift</v>
<v Speaker 3>orbitz and change and what we know,</v>

1364
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 3>maybe look at the surface of the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1365
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 3>it covered in craters and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they all seem to hit about the</v>

1366
01:08:50.901 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 3>same time and it's about three point 8</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago or so.</v>

1367
01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's called the late heavy</v>

1368
01:08:56.931 --> 01:09:00.210
<v Speaker 3>bombardment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that if you look at cratering</v>

1369
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 3>and rates on Mars or the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all seemed to happen in this,</v>

1370
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.440
<v Speaker 3>not all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a big peak around that time.</v>

1371
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to be correlated with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neptune moving outwards in the solar</v>

1372
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 3>system and into Kuyper belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically our towards the Kuyper belt</v>

1373
01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 3>and causing all sorts of havoc and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes into the inner solar</v>

1374
01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those things happen and it didn't</v>

1375
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.870
<v Speaker 3>happen when life was established on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

1376
01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.080
<v Speaker 3>so it's all extremely old stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shifting to explore.</v>

1377
01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.280
<v Speaker 3>But how long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long is the source system,</v>

1378
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:36.281
<v Speaker 3>but in this particular stable situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in it since about three point 8</v>

1379
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:41.150
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if it'd been unstable at any point</v>

1380
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 3>since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we likely wouldn't be here.</v>

1381
01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that it's possible?</v>

1382
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever entertain the idea that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that we are the only</v>

1383
01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:53.110
<v Speaker 3>intelligent life in the known universe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1384
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tend to restrict myself to the galaxy.</v>

1385
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 3>So I do think it's possible that at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment there's one civilization in the</v>

1386
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:07.421
<v Speaker 3>Milky Way and that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's important actually.</v>

1387
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:12.740
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to I was saying at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>start about the astronomy and cosmology</v>

1388
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 3>being part of the framework within which</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to think if you're looking for</v>

1389
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 3>meaning or you're looking for how we</v>
<v Speaker 3>should behave even politically.</v>

1390
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:24.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the that has a bearing to me.</v>

1391
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that we're the only place where</v>

1392
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:32.321
<v Speaker 3>there is intelligence in this galaxy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how should we behave,</v>

1393
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we actually not withstanding the</v>

1394
01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:40.430
<v Speaker 3>fact that we're tiny and fragile things</v>
<v Speaker 3>an insignificant physically should we</v>

1395
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:45.431
<v Speaker 3>consider ourselves extremely valuable in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that respect because there's nowhere</v>

1396
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:49.970
<v Speaker 3>else where you know that I would go as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as to say there will be nowhere else</v>

1397
01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:54.110
<v Speaker 3>where meaning exists in the Milky Way in</v>
<v Speaker 3>because meeting.</v>

1398
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't talk about very much.</v>

1399
01:10:56.421 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Although Richard Fineman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my great heroes did talk about</v>

1400
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.000
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a quote where he says,</v>

1401
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the meaning of it all?</v>

1402
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a great essay called the value of</v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

1403
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>and so what is self evidently true is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meaning exists here because it</v>

1404
01:11:12.051 --> 01:11:15.390
<v Speaker 3>means something to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of an obvious statement.</v>

1405
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Your life means something to you in May</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so meaning exists,</v>

1406
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.550
<v Speaker 3>but I think it is a local and temporary</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

1407
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It emerges,</v>

1408
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 3>meaning emerges from configurations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>atoms,</v>

1409
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.490
<v Speaker 3>which is what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are simply that.</v>

1410
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 3>We're nothing more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're very,</v>

1411
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 3>very rare configuration of atoms I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1412
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and so that means that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go all the way down that line of</v>

1413
01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.130
<v Speaker 3>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are the only island meaning in the</v>

1414
01:11:47.131 --> 01:11:47.920
<v Speaker 3>galaxy.</v>

1415
01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.960
<v Speaker 3>I will meaning only to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.780
<v Speaker 3>It means something to us because we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only ones who can grasp the concept</v>

1417
01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.000
<v Speaker 3>and we are finite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are finite organism,</v>

1418
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:04.830
<v Speaker 3>we have this temporary existence while</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're here and to us there is meaning.</v>

1419
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1420
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:09.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any other way to define it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll define it like that.</v>

1421
01:12:09.031 --> 01:12:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a globe.</v>

1422
01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you have to believe there's</v>

1423
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.030
<v Speaker 3>some kind of global meaning God type</v>
<v Speaker 3>finger.</v>

1424
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's.</v>

1425
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more wonderful and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging to us because we have to</v>

1426
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:27.801
<v Speaker 3>take responsibility for it to say we</v>
<v Speaker 3>should operate such that we are it in</v>

1427
01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 3>this galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing else.</v>

1428
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1429
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are other civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in the universe because there</v>

1430
01:12:35.821 --> 01:12:37.720
<v Speaker 3>are 2 trillion galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1431
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe this hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in other places.</v>

1432
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 3>The question is how often does it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

1433
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 3>And how widely spaced are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilizations and I think they're very</v>

1434
01:12:47.581 --> 01:12:52.140
<v Speaker 3>widely spaced and I think there may be</v>
<v Speaker 3>one or two per galaxy on the average.</v>

1435
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 3>I could put that as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what you said it beautifully,</v>

1436
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else can we think?</v>

1437
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else do you want?</v>

1438
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what it says is you have to take</v>

1439
01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for all of those things</v>
<v Speaker 3>or spiritual things that you think about</v>

1440
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:09.280
<v Speaker 3>and the emotional things you think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1441
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1442
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are responsible for that.</v>

1443
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 3>You are that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whatever that is,</v>

1444
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:20.190
<v Speaker 3>it exists in you and it will only exist</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a short amount of time.</v>

1445
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And so what you know make the best of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be my view.</v>

1446
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:30.470
<v Speaker 3>It's so unbelievably compelling though</v>
<v Speaker 3>to consider the idea that somewhere out</v>

1447
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:35.930
<v Speaker 3>there there's another civilization that</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even more advanced than us and</v>

1448
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.880
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thought of it is just so</v>

1449
01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:39.750
<v Speaker 3>attractive.</v>

1450
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.970
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

1451
01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.520
<v Speaker 3>That shit should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1452
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 3>if civilizations are common or even</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly common,</v>

1453
01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>then there should be civilizations ahead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of us.</v>

1454
01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's been so much time,</v>

1455
01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.230
<v Speaker 3>but when you want to see what that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1456
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been so compelling.</v>

1457
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:59.970
<v Speaker 3>You imagined the timescales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been around a civilization,</v>

1458
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.490
<v Speaker 3>let's say 40,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long I civilization's</v>

1459
01:14:03.491 --> 01:14:05.590
<v Speaker 3>been around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that the,</v>

1460
01:14:05.591 --> 01:14:08.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the galaxy is pretty much as old as the</v>

1461
01:14:08.281 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen billion years worth of time.</v>

1462
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that there are no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no civilization zeroes,</v>

1463
01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:18.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 million years ago,</v>

1464
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.400
<v Speaker 3>200 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1 billion years ago.</v>

1465
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 3>And imagine what they'd be like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd survived.</v>

1466
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:25.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been,</v>

1467
01:14:25.391 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 3>we've been around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had science for let's say since</v>

1468
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Newton or copernicus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>500 years at most we've had.</v>

1469
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:36.130
<v Speaker 3>And look what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gone beyond the solar system with</v>

1470
01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:36.964
<v Speaker 3>voyager.</v>

1471
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:41.140
<v Speaker 3>We've walked on the moon and we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>about to go to Mars,</v>

1472
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're about to begin colonizing our</v>

1473
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:48.250
<v Speaker 3>own solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we've done that in 500 years.</v>

1474
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a million years in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1475
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 3>So I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the arguments often used to</v>

1476
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:57.730
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there aren't any civilizations out there</v>

1477
01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 3>in the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the Fermi paradox because if</v>

1478
01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:03.340
<v Speaker 3>you imagine a civilization that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>million years ahead of us,</v>

1479
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 3>they should have written their presence</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the sky by now.</v>

1480
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.510
<v Speaker 3>They should use to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1481
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:12.940
<v Speaker 3>you'll see us if we survive in million</v>
<v Speaker 3>years into the future.</v>

1482
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Actually even a few thousand years into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>

1483
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 3>we will be exploring the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will have spacecraft that are going</v>

1484
01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:22.270
<v Speaker 3>to wear the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will be doing it,</v>

1485
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:27.630
<v Speaker 3>so our signature will become visible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if we last into the medium</v>

1486
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.860
<v Speaker 3>term,</v>

1487
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.860
<v Speaker 4>we choose to not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's my thought on that is uncontacted</v>

1488
01:15:34.261 --> 01:15:39.030
<v Speaker 4>tribes like do you know about the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gentleman who was the missionary who</v>

1489
01:15:39.031 --> 01:15:42.090
<v Speaker 4>visited North Sentinel Island and was</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed by the natives,</v>

1490
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:45.000
<v Speaker 4>north central island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a really unusual place because</v>

1491
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:48.390
<v Speaker 4>they branched off from Africa 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and they've been living on</v>

1492
01:15:48.391 --> 01:15:52.440
<v Speaker 4>this one small island the size of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manhattan and as well as we know there's</v>

1493
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:56.600
<v Speaker 4>only about 39 of them left somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>around there and um,</v>

1494
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:59.880
<v Speaker 4>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not supposed to contact them like</v>

1495
01:15:59.881 --> 01:16:04.260
<v Speaker 4>people are not supposed we're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like leave them alone and there are</v>

1496
01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:06.210
<v Speaker 4>rare tribe when they find them in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon,</v>

1497
01:16:06.211 --> 01:16:10.170
<v Speaker 4>the uncontacted tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our initial instincts back off and leave</v>

1498
01:16:10.171 --> 01:16:11.520
<v Speaker 4>them alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave them alone.</v>

1499
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that perhaps the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if there is a civilization that's a</v>

1500
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.900
<v Speaker 4>million times more advanced than us have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been around here for,</v>

1501
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that millions of years of life as</v>

1502
01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:24.360
<v Speaker 4>opposed to quarter million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would they,</v>

1503
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.110
<v Speaker 4>why would they let us know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look at us dropping bombs on each</v>

1504
01:16:28.111 --> 01:16:32.300
<v Speaker 4>other and polluting the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking all the fish out and putting</v>

1505
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:35.850
<v Speaker 4>clouds into the skies of dirt and</v>
<v Speaker 4>particles.</v>

1506
01:16:35.851 --> 01:16:38.240
<v Speaker 4>And why would they literally look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crude monkey?</v>

1507
01:16:38.241 --> 01:16:42.510
<v Speaker 4>So are there data there is so far beyond</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they need to be before they could</v>

1508
01:16:42.511 --> 01:16:46.410
<v Speaker 4>join the galactic civilization or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

1509
01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:48.600
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an argument that the reason.</v>

1510
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No argument</v>

1511
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.310
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The IT technology so advanced would be</v>

1512
01:16:53.311 --> 01:16:56.970
<v Speaker 3>difficult for us to detect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we tend to think of know when you</v>

1513
01:16:56.971 --> 01:16:59.140
<v Speaker 3>say written across the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it's trigger.</v>

1514
01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of star ships and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like star wars,</v>

1515
01:17:01.681 --> 01:17:02.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Energy.</v>

1516
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Things that you can see the signature</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1517
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:08.370
<v Speaker 3>but actually maybe the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The civilization just becomes a nano</v>

1518
01:17:08.371 --> 01:17:10.030
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tiny</v>

1519
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:11.720
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us because that's more</v>

1520
01:17:11.721 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a better way to do things.</v>

1521
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that there are space probes</v>

1522
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 2>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so small and it's so efficient</v>

1523
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 2>and you sell it low energy that we just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see them as far as that is</v>

1524
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My other thought is that where we are</v>

1525
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:30.800
<v Speaker 2>headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that there's some sort of</v>

1526
01:17:30.801 --> 01:17:33.920
<v Speaker 2>a strange symbiosis that's taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1527
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a strange connection that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to electronics and ultimately to an</v>

1528
01:17:38.811 --> 01:17:41.180
<v Speaker 2>artificial creation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence,</v>

1529
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.700
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial light life,</v>

1530
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 2>something that's created by carbon based</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

1531
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are beings that isn't cellular,</v>

1532
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:56.090
<v Speaker 2>but also acts like life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this may be the future of life,</v>

1533
01:17:56.390 --> 01:18:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that we are so connected to the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh and blood and bone,</v>

1534
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:07.090
<v Speaker 2>but maybe this is just a temporary</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation until we transition or not</v>

1535
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 2>transition to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it surpasses us and this is the next</v>

1536
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 2>stage of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this stage has no need for all the</v>

1537
01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:19.280
<v Speaker 2>human and biological reward systems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in place that made sure that we</v>

1538
01:18:19.281 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

1539
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's ego or fear or emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no need for that,</v>

1540
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.320
<v Speaker 2>that it will just exist and maintain its</v>
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium as this new form of life and</v>

1541
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:35.630
<v Speaker 2>that this is the future of life in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and that will get there.</v>

1542
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'll only be 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years from now,</v>

1543
01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.100
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's what exists all throughout</v>

1544
01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no need to peacock.</v>

1545
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:47.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no need to show our sand on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sky and that it just exists in this</v>

1546
01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:48.464
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1547
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1548
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the counter argument to the Fermi</v>

1550
01:18:56.811 --> 01:18:59.560
<v Speaker 2>paradox argument that I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

1551
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.960
<v Speaker 2>exactly as you've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that basically you evolved to a point</v>

1552
01:19:02.961 --> 01:19:07.070
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly where you just don't create</v>
<v Speaker 2>a signature and you don't really get</v>

1553
01:19:07.071 --> 01:19:11.020
<v Speaker 2>involved as you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it just maintains,</v>

1554
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 2>but it has no.</v>

1555
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no motivation,</v>

1556
01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1557
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:18.050
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our motivations are so weird,</v>

1558
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have these biological motivations to</v>

1559
01:19:20.551 --> 01:19:22.370
<v Speaker 2>survive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1560
01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:26.210
<v Speaker 2>there's motivation is to conquer and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovate and to spread our genes and to</v>

1561
01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>move into new territories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you didn't have biology,</v>

1562
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 2>if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you existed completely from manmade</v>

1563
01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:38.750
<v Speaker 2>materials or from materials found on</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and that this new form of life is</v>

1564
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:41.640
<v Speaker 2>created out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have those unless you program</v>

1565
01:19:41.641 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why would you do that?</v>

1566
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.020
<v Speaker 2>It is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>

1567
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:48.350
<v Speaker 2>to two because we don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is.</v>

1568
01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It's often called the hard problem in</v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1569
01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:55.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good question whether you can</v>

1570
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 2>build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you want to build a self</v>

1571
01:19:56.991 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 2>replicating machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you're talking about,</v>

1572
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 2>something that can go and maybe go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon or Mars and replicates itself</v>

1573
01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 2>and then carry on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a living thing.</v>

1574
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1575
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>does he have to have a sufficient level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of intelligence that he actually is</v>

1576
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>conscious and all these things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about,</v>

1577
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this word meaning that we used earlier</v>

1578
01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 2>that we all understand that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>define,</v>

1579
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:25.550
<v Speaker 2>is that a emergent property that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to emerge if you've got</v>

1580
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:31.401
<v Speaker 2>something that's intelligent enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate itself and live and said to be</v>

1581
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:34.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer,</v>

1582
01:20:34.501 --> 01:20:38.040
<v Speaker 2>but it is worth considering that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1583
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:43.070
<v Speaker 2>this what we emotion meaning love and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and all those things are just the</v>

1584
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:46.410
<v Speaker 2>things that happen when you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

1585
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could possibly be.</v>

1586
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.800
<v Speaker 2>And does consciousness have to have our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1587
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:57.060
<v Speaker 2>local origin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't have to come from a</v>

1588
01:20:57.061 --> 01:21:00.510
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think about cellular</v>

1589
01:21:00.511 --> 01:21:01.820
<v Speaker 2>communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1590
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 2>if you send me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in England and you send me a</v>

1591
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>video from your phone and it reaches my</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>

1592
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.900
<v Speaker 2>it's getting to meet through space.</v>

1593
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It's going through the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like literally from a device not</v>

1594
01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:18.740
<v Speaker 2>connected by any wires or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming to me if,</v>

1595
01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>if there's a possibility to create some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of global intelligence through</v>

1596
01:21:24.601 --> 01:21:29.330
<v Speaker 2>electronics that's nonlocal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one piece of it falls off this same</v>

1597
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:32.250
<v Speaker 2>is it just repairs itself or figures</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself out,</v>

1598
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:37.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same consciousness existing</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a global scale through some sort of</v>

1599
01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>an electronic network that instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1600
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.090
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you and I have that Brian</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Joe are,</v>

1601
01:21:43.230 --> 01:21:45.500
<v Speaker 2>you have your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my mind and we,</v>

1602
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:49.410
<v Speaker 2>we exist as intelligent being separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>from each other,</v>

1603
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.520
<v Speaker 2>but instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of it is connected and that all</v>

1604
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:58.521
<v Speaker 2>of it is something that we can't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceive of because our brains are too</v>

1605
01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:01.500
<v Speaker 2>crude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like trying to explain to,</v>

1606
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:02.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia Pithy,</v>

1607
01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 2>kiss what a satellite is.</v>

1608
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1609
01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of you think about our brains,</v>

1610
01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>they are ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they?</v>

1611
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:16.790
<v Speaker 2>They're just a distributed network of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells connected by neurons and they're</v>

1612
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.460
<v Speaker 2>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are a colony of things that are</v>

1613
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 2>autonomous in a sense and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating with each other.</v>

1614
01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:24.060
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1615
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why you can't scale that up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in principle.</v>

1616
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just add the caveat is always</v>

1617
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:33.720
<v Speaker 2>that we don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not understood.</v>

1618
01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something weird</v>

1619
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:37.890
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm damn sure it's physical.</v>

1620
01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm damn sure that there's nothing going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in my head other than what is allowed</v>

1621
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:45.600
<v Speaker 2>by the laws of nature as we understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1622
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:50.580
<v Speaker 2>So eliminating show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean the idea of a soul being some</v>

1623
01:22:50.581 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of a divine thing that's inside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>housing of the body?</v>

1624
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:54.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1625
01:22:54.751 --> 01:22:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1626
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I would say we can rule that out</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

1627
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I've argued in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you rule it out?</v>

1628
01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I valued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can rule that out in the following</v>

1629
01:23:03.331 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1630
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 2>so here's my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1631
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1632
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.050
<v Speaker 3>it's made of electrons and protons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutrons.</v>

1633
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:08.861
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1634
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 3>if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I have a soul in the,</v>

1635
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 3>something that we don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a different kind of energy or</v>

1636
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is we don't have in physics</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the moment,</v>

1637
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 3>it interacts with matter because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving my hand around.</v>

1638
01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it something that interact very strongly</v>

1639
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 3>with matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the history of</v>

1640
01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 3>particle physics in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the study of matter,</v>

1641
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.010
<v Speaker 3>we spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we spent decades making high precision</v>

1642
01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.810
<v Speaker 3>measurements of how massive behaves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interacts and we look for,</v>

1643
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:41.980
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a fifth force of nature.</v>

1644
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.640
<v Speaker 3>So we know for forces the gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two nuclear forces called the weak</v>

1645
01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 3>and strong nuclear forces and</v>
<v Speaker 3>electromagnetism.</v>

1646
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:53.830
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we know exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we look for another one with ultra</v>

1647
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.900
<v Speaker 3>high precision and we don't see any</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence of it.</v>

1648
01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:01.410
<v Speaker 3>So I would claim that we know how matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>interacts at these energies.</v>

1649
01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.800
<v Speaker 3>So room temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now these,</v>

1650
01:24:04.801 --> 01:24:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Angie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know how matter interacts very</v>

1651
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 3>precisely and so if you want to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>the something else that interacts with</v>

1652
01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:16.510
<v Speaker 3>matter strongly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I would say that it's ruled out.</v>

1653
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I would go as far to say it's ruled out</v>
<v Speaker 3>by experiment or at least he sees</v>

1654
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.430
<v Speaker 3>extremely subtle and you would have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump through a lot of hoops to come up</v>

1655
01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:29.080
<v Speaker 3>with a theory of some stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have seen when we've observed</v>

1656
01:24:29.081 --> 01:24:34.081
<v Speaker 3>how matter interacts that is present in</v>
<v Speaker 3>our bodies and presumably be believing</v>

1657
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.060
<v Speaker 3>the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want it to exist outside.</v>

1658
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:39.040
<v Speaker 3>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still want the thing to be there and</v>

1659
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.110
<v Speaker 3>you might believe in ghosts and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1660
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:42.610
<v Speaker 3>We like a ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a.</v>

1661
01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.920
<v Speaker 3>It is something that carries the imprint</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

1662
01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Presumably it looks like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means that interact strongly</v>

1663
01:24:50.291 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 3>with the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is you because it carries a</v>

1664
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:55.120
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It carries a pattern and it carries</v>

1665
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:57.280
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It carries information.</v>

1666
01:24:57.281 --> 01:25:00.250
<v Speaker 3>There has to be an energy source that</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows the information to assist in the</v>

1667
01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 3>pattern to persistence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

1668
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up with a theory that is</v>

1669
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:09.010
<v Speaker 3>postulating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something interacts with light because</v>

1670
01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 3>if you think a ghost is the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's something that people see</v>

1671
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:16.540
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means it interacts with light.</v>

1672
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:21.930
<v Speaker 3>But we know how light interacts and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruled out anything but the most subtle,</v>

1673
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>further interaction that we haven't</v>

1674
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would,</v>

1675
01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:29.680
<v Speaker 3>I claim that I started off as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually,</v>

1676
01:25:29.681 --> 01:25:31.270
<v Speaker 3>I wrote it in an infinite monkey cage</v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

1677
01:25:31.271 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 3>this radio show that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he ended up,</v>

1678
01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 3>when I'd written it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought actually that it makes sense.</v>

1679
01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.950
<v Speaker 3>And I read some news similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1680
01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm Sean Carroll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

1681
01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've had shown up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>couple times.</v>

1682
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:46.030
<v Speaker 3>He's said something the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the book that he wrote the</v>

1683
01:25:46.031 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 3>big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he has a similar argument</v>

1684
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's occurred to him as well,</v>

1685
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:54.220
<v Speaker 3>is roughly the same argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you.</v>

1686
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 3>So this energy that's interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>

1687
01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 3>even if you're not moving at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're just thinking it's interacting</v>

1688
01:26:02.381 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 3>with the matter encompasses your</v>

1689
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.580
<v Speaker 4>mind or your brain or your nerves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neurons.</v>

1690
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 4>It's something in there that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with matter whether you like</v>

1691
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 4>it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even just a simple thought process or</v>

1692
01:26:15.201 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 4>a dream is still something it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with Matt.</v>

1693
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well obviously because you know you,</v>

1694
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:22.680
<v Speaker 4>it's your will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1695
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:27.290
<v Speaker 4>When you move it's presumably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even if you're not moving the idea,</v>

1696
01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 4>like the year you're saying you're like</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body's interacting with batteries,</v>

1697
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.300
<v Speaker 4>you're moving your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even if you're not moving,</v>

1698
01:26:32.301 --> 01:26:34.820
<v Speaker 4>if you're just thinking and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely still,</v>

1699
01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>which is not totally possible because</v>
<v Speaker 4>your heart's beating and your breathing</v>

1700
01:26:37.311 --> 01:26:40.640
<v Speaker 4>and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if somehow or another you were able</v>

1701
01:26:40.641 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 4>to isolate just the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thoughts themselves are still</v>

1702
01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 4>interacting with matter because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with the brain itself.</v>

1703
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:51.760
<v Speaker 3>So there's something in there that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to interact with the physical</v>

1705
01:26:51.761 --> 01:26:54.850
<v Speaker 3>structure of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and now I would say there isn't.</v>

1706
01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:58.990
<v Speaker 3>So that's</v>

1707
01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.200
<v Speaker 4>the woo woo version is that the brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself and the body of the physical,</v>

1708
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:10.510
<v Speaker 4>the spiritual self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are merely an antenna that's tuning</v>

1709
01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:14.980
<v Speaker 4>in to the great consciousness of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>

1710
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.230
<v Speaker 3>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you have to answer what we</v>

1711
01:27:19.231 --> 01:27:20.370
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're made of.</v>

1712
01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So we know how those particles behave</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interact.</v>

1713
01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.590
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why did the particles not a in any</v>

1714
01:27:28.591 --> 01:27:30.990
<v Speaker 3>way interact with that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we interact,</v>

1715
01:27:30.991 --> 01:27:34.560
<v Speaker 3>we don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't only just interact with it,</v>

1716
01:27:34.561 --> 01:27:37.050
<v Speaker 3>so we interact extremely strongly with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1717
01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.460
<v Speaker 3>We're interacting with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Every movement I make is the interaction</v>
<v Speaker 3>between that.</v>

1719
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Every man have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When everything.</v>

1721
01:27:46.111 --> 01:27:50.220
<v Speaker 3>If I moved my fingers or everything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing is an interaction between that</v>

1722
01:27:50.221 --> 01:27:53.370
<v Speaker 3>stuff and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a very strong interaction with</v>

1723
01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:56.760
<v Speaker 3>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't see it in all our precision</v>

1724
01:27:56.761 --> 01:27:58.300
<v Speaker 3>measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1725
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:00.540
<v Speaker 3>the answer for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is because it's not there.</v>

1726
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.210
<v Speaker 3>The answer is Jesus and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure God.</v>

1727
01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:08.250
<v Speaker 3>That may be an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point is you as we'd sell it for</v>

1728
01:28:08.251 --> 01:28:11.340
<v Speaker 3>earlier with absolute space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't measure it,</v>

1729
01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:15.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1730
01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.150
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1731
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 4>but for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

1732
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 4>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is some incredible motivation to</v>

1733
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:27.910
<v Speaker 4>find a divine something or another</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's there's something greater than</v>

1734
01:28:30.741 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 4>this physical being that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1735
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:35.840
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is that compulsion?</v>

1736
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:38.360
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already talked a bit of balance</v>

1737
01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:42.350
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes to the the heart of this</v>

1738
01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:47.351
<v Speaker 3>question of what it means to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say that being human,</v>

1739
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:53.660
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to the meaning</v>

1740
01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:56.390
<v Speaker 3>grid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the answer would be,</v>

1741
01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are small finite beings,</v>

1742
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which are just clusters of atoms as we</v>

1743
01:29:04.831 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very rare,</v>

1744
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but we understand roughly how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they came to be,</v>

1745
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 3>and we have a limited amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not actually unfortunately,</v>

1746
01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:20.241
<v Speaker 3>but because of the laws of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the laws of nature for bidders to be</v>

1747
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:21.400
<v Speaker 3>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1748
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.931
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1749
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>they a mortalities ruled out by the laws</v>
<v Speaker 3>of physics,</v>

1750
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:30.510
<v Speaker 3>but also actually what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting about if you look at</v>

1751
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:34.560
<v Speaker 3>the basic physics of the universe going</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Big Bang to where we are today,</v>

1752
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.280
<v Speaker 3>then the physics is driven by the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the universe began in extremely old</v>

1753
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:45.980
<v Speaker 3>state because it was a very highly</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordered system and it is tending towards</v>

1754
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 3>a more disordered system at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's called the second law of</v>

1755
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:50.850
<v Speaker 3>thermodynamics.</v>

1756
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.450
<v Speaker 3>And it's that basic common sense thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that things go to shit.</v>

1757
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Basically it's the second law of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thermodynamics.</v>

1758
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:02.230
<v Speaker 3>What we strongly suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say no,</v>

1759
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:08.010
<v Speaker 3>is that in that process of going from</v>
<v Speaker 3>order to disorder,</v>

1760
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.930
<v Speaker 3>complexity emerges naturally for a brief</v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time,</v>

1761
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:18.210
<v Speaker 3>so it's a natural part of the evolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the universe that you get a period in</v>

1762
01:30:18.211 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 3>time when there's complexity in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

1763
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:24.690
<v Speaker 3>stars and planets and galaxies and life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and civilizations,</v>

1764
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:28.350
<v Speaker 3>but they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exist because the universe is</v>

1765
01:30:28.351 --> 01:30:31.140
<v Speaker 3>decaying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in spite of the fact the universe is</v>

1766
01:30:31.141 --> 01:30:35.460
<v Speaker 3>decaying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so our existence in that sort of picture</v>

1767
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 3>is necessarily finite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessarily time limited,</v>

1768
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.030
<v Speaker 3>and it is a remarkable thing that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity has got so far that there are</v>

1769
01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:48.210
<v Speaker 3>things in the universe that can think</v>
<v Speaker 3>and feel and explore it,</v>

1770
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:52.380
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want an answer to the meaning of</v>

1771
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:53.560
<v Speaker 3>it all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that,</v>

1772
01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.140
<v Speaker 3>that you are part of the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the way the laws of nature</v>

1773
01:30:58.141 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are allowed to exist,</v>

1774
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:05.450
<v Speaker 3>but you're allowed to exist for</v>
<v Speaker 3>temporary for a small amount of time in</v>

1775
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.990
<v Speaker 3>a possibly infinite universe.</v>

1776
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:11.770
<v Speaker 4>One of the biggest mind blowing moments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1777
01:31:11.771 --> 01:31:16.771
<v Speaker 4>of my limited comprehension of what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>means to be a living being was when I</v>

1778
01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:21.931
<v Speaker 4>found out that carbon and all the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes us has to come out of a dying</v>

1779
01:31:23.501 --> 01:31:25.840
<v Speaker 4>star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that alone,</v>

1780
01:31:25.841 --> 01:31:30.841
<v Speaker 4>that there's this very strange cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these enormous fireballs that forge the</v>

1781
01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:39.031
<v Speaker 4>material that makes Brian Cox like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1782
01:31:39.071 --> 01:31:44.071
<v Speaker 4>that one alone that there is some</v>
<v Speaker 4>strange loop of of,</v>

1783
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:50.060
<v Speaker 4>of biological life that comes from</v>
<v Speaker 4>stars,</v>

1784
01:31:50.561 --> 01:31:53.350
<v Speaker 4>which is like the most elemental thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can observe.</v>

1785
01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:56.410
<v Speaker 4>We see these things in the school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the sun in the sky.</v>

1786
01:31:56.411 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 4>It's this all powerful ball fire and</v>

1787
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:05.100
<v Speaker 2>that that is where the building blocks</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a person come from and they will be</v>

1788
01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>from the carbon atoms in our body that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1789
01:32:08.981 --> 01:32:13.210
<v Speaker 2>They all got made in stars because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just none of it at the big bang.</v>

1790
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.620
<v Speaker 2>There's only hydrogen and helium tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit lithium to be precise but nothing</v>

1791
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was all made in stars and it's</v>

1792
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:23.380
<v Speaker 2>probably from different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the acids in your body.</v>

1793
01:32:23.381 --> 01:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>They're not all from one star that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooked it and then died.</v>

1794
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:30.100
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a mixture of stuff for many</v>
<v Speaker 2>styles in your body now,</v>

1795
01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 2>and I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The what more do you want?</v>

1796
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1797
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:36.640
<v Speaker 2>when I see people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want more than that.</v>

1798
01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.650
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1799
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>it must.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be more to it.</v>

1800
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:40.680
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1801
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:41.820
<v Speaker 2>the we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

1802
01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.210
<v Speaker 2>we were the ingredients now voltage were</v>
<v Speaker 2>assembled in the hearts of long dead</v>

1803
01:32:46.211 --> 01:32:50.940
<v Speaker 2>stars over billions of years and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>assembled themselves spontaneously into</v>

1804
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:55.780
<v Speaker 2>temporary structures that can think and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel and explore and then their</v>

1805
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:58.090
<v Speaker 2>structures will decay away again at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1806
01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.760
<v Speaker 2>and in the very far future there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>no structures left.</v>

1807
01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there we are.</v>

1808
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 2>We exist in this little window when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can observe this magnificent universe.</v>

1809
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want any more?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think too,</v>

1810
01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 2>people will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people aren't aware of</v>

1811
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the information,</v>

1812
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think on top of it,</v>

1813
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:21.211
<v Speaker 2>for some people it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so overwhelming this,</v>

1814
01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:26.980
<v Speaker 2>this concept of 13 point 8 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everything to get to this point that</v>

1815
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:30.940
<v Speaker 2>we're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so overwhelming that they want to</v>

1816
01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 2>simplify it and want to put it into some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a fable structure.</v>

1817
01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Something where it's something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common and similar and familiar.</v>

1818
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:42.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1819
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1820
01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1821
01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.430
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is the,</v>

1822
01:33:48.431 --> 01:33:50.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the journey that we go on,</v>

1823
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:55.510
<v Speaker 2>the real treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is in that journey of trying</v>

1824
01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:57.220
<v Speaker 2>to face the incomprehensible.</v>

1825
01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 2>It's in that realization that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost,</v>

1826
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we exist.</v>

1827
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1828
01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:10.090
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wonderful thing.</v>

1829
01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's what I think you</v>

1830
01:34:12.741 --> 01:34:15.470
<v Speaker 2>miss out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you decide to simplify it</v>

1831
01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:18.790
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to face that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to face the infinity</v>

1832
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:23.770
<v Speaker 2>that's out there in front of us and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to face those stories as you</v>

1833
01:34:23.771 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you look at your finger and it's</v>

1834
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:30.430
<v Speaker 2>ingredients cooked in multiple styles</v>
<v Speaker 2>over billions of years.</v>

1835
01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:32.380
<v Speaker 2>That that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

1836
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a joyous and powerful thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>

1837
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you're missing out if you</v>

1838
01:34:37.931 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 2>don't want to face that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I think the distribution of</v>

1839
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:44.260
<v Speaker 2>information has changed so radically</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last couple of hundred years</v>

1840
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:49.060
<v Speaker 2>and particularly over the last 20 that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing these trends now or more</v>

1841
01:34:49.061 --> 01:34:54.061
<v Speaker 2>people are inclined to abandon a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1842
01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Even if you remain religious remain you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep a a thought or a belief in a</v>

1843
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are more inclined to entertain</v>

1844
01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:11.291
<v Speaker 2>these concepts of science and to take in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the understanding of what has been</v>

1845
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:16.601
<v Speaker 2>observed and documented and written</v>
<v Speaker 2>about amongst scholars and academics and</v>

1846
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:20.150
<v Speaker 2>there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more people accepting that.</v>

1847
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at the number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>agnostic people now as opposed to 20,</v>

1848
01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:24.600
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1849
01:35:24.601 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rising,</v>

1850
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it's changing and I think there's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of you and because of Neil</v>

1851
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 2>degrasse Tyson and Sean Carroll and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these other people that are public</v>

1852
01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals that are discussing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff,</v>

1853
01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 2>people like myself have a far greater</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of this than I think</v>

1854
01:35:41.001 --> 01:35:44.120
<v Speaker 2>people did 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 years ago and that trend is</v>

1855
01:35:44.121 --> 01:35:46.520
<v Speaker 2>continuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a very good direction.</v>

1856
01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:47.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1857
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we should say is that science,</v>

1858
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 2>we don't know all the emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know where the laws of</v>

1859
01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 2>nature came from.</v>

1860
01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.680
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why the universe began and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that it did if indeed at the</v>

1861
01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't know why the Big Bang was</v>

1862
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:07.780
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very highly olded,</v>

1863
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:11.380
<v Speaker 2>which is ultimately a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Carol actually you mentioned him</v>

1864
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:14.740
<v Speaker 2>often points out it means right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they.</v>

1865
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:18.510
<v Speaker 2>The whole difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only difference between the past and</v>

1866
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 2>the future so-called called Arrow of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time is that in the past the universe</v>

1867
01:36:21.891 --> 01:36:26.450
<v Speaker 2>was really old and it's getting more</v>
<v Speaker 2>disordered and that's that,</v>

1868
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:30.530
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that necessary state of older,</v>

1869
01:36:30.531 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 2>at the start of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really the reason that we</v>

1870
01:36:33.651 --> 01:36:35.930
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason cause the universe</v>

1871
01:36:35.931 --> 01:36:40.931
<v Speaker 2>began in a particular form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why that was so we,</v>

1872
01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:43.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will probably find out at some point</v>

1873
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.130
<v Speaker 2>and it'll be something to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of nature,</v>

1874
01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.770
<v Speaker 2>but so I'm always careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>

1875
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Science can sometimes sound arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1876
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It can sometimes sound like it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the discipline of saying to people</v>

1877
01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:56.334
<v Speaker 2>where you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1878
01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.470
<v Speaker 2>and it's not the discipline of saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not right.</v>

1879
01:36:59.471 --> 01:37:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It's saying this is what we found out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:03.274
<v Speaker 2>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1881
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked to say that it provides a</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework within which if you want to</v>

1882
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:11.440
<v Speaker 2>philosophize or you want to do theology</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you want to,</v>

1883
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.660
<v Speaker 2>you want to ask these deep questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about why we're here.</v>

1884
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to operate within that</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework because it's just an</v>

1885
01:37:17.391 --> 01:37:21.410
<v Speaker 2>observational framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything we've said is stuff we've</v>

1886
01:37:21.411 --> 01:37:24.080
<v Speaker 2>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not stuff that someone made up,</v>

1887
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:25.243
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1888
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:26.211
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1889
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand nuclear physics,</v>

1890
01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 2>we can build nuclear reactors for</v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1891
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:34.640
<v Speaker 2>so we understand the physics of stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we understand that the styles built</v>

1892
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:38.800
<v Speaker 2>the carbon and oxygen and we know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it and we can see it because as</v>

1893
01:37:38.801 --> 01:37:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1894
01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.940
<v Speaker 2>if you look far out into the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking way back in time and as</v>

1895
01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:47.510
<v Speaker 2>you look back in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see less carbon and less oxygen.</v>

1896
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:52.220
<v Speaker 2>So we have a direct observation that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earliest universe there wasn't any</v>

1897
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>because we can see it and now we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is some and we</v>

1898
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 3>know how it was made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's so.</v>

1899
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:03.351
<v Speaker 3>It's important to be humble when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about science and you're not</v>

1900
01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 3>saying this is the way that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you are in a sense,</v>

1901
01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not able to answer ultimate</v>

1902
01:38:12.661 --> 01:38:17.040
<v Speaker 3>questions at the moment is not able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer even whether the universe had a</v>

1903
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 3>beginning or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know that.</v>

1904
01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.030
<v Speaker 3>And I gave it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1905
01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I was asked to give a talk to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>bishops in the UK about cosmology and I</v>

1906
01:38:26.131 --> 01:38:26.401
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1907
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.820
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I went and I gave him this talk</v>

1908
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:30.231
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1909
01:38:30.231 --> 01:38:32.520
<v Speaker 3>and at the end I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some questions.</v>

1910
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.880
<v Speaker 3>So if the universe is eternal and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be,</v>

1911
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 3>it might not have had the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's eternal,</v>

1912
01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:42.340
<v Speaker 3>what place is there for a creator?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1913
01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.010
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1914
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 3>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have an answer of course and</v>

1915
01:38:46.681 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 3>eternal creator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet.</v>

1916
01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 3>But I think that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be eternal and we might</v>

1917
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.860
<v Speaker 3>discover that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't,</v>

1918
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:55.200
<v Speaker 3>we don't know at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we might.</v>

1919
01:38:55.650 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 3>So I think my point is that these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

1920
01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:04.920
<v Speaker 3>a decisive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very natural to religions and natural</v>

1921
01:39:04.921 --> 01:39:05.371
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1922
01:39:05.371 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 3>People you see all across the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all different cultures.</v>

1923
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:13.520
<v Speaker 3>But I think that in the 21st century it</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion needs to operate within that</v>

1924
01:39:14.401 --> 01:39:15.990
<v Speaker 3>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's going,</v>

1925
01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 3>it's going to operate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are still great mysteries and it</v>

1926
01:39:20.101 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 3>is appropriate to think about what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>means to be human and are giving you my</v>

1927
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:25.470
<v Speaker 3>view of what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1928
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:28.530
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think the problem comes when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1929
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.560
<v Speaker 3>when you're your theology or your</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy forces you to deny some</v>

1930
01:39:34.110 --> 01:39:35.820
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some measurement.</v>

1931
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 3>Now these things that measurements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were not saying,</v>

1932
01:39:38.941 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not my opinion.</v>

1933
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 3>The Universe is 13 point 8 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1934
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:44.280
<v Speaker 3>We measured it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like having an opinion between the</v>

1935
01:39:44.281 --> 01:39:47.560
<v Speaker 3>distance from La to New York that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't have an opinion on that.</v>

1936
01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 3>What it is and it's the same decided</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the three things you notice is that</v>

1937
01:39:53.221 --> 01:39:54.870
<v Speaker 3>people say the earth is flat or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1938
01:39:54.871 --> 01:39:57.630
<v Speaker 3>or it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've measured it so it's just stop</v>

1939
01:39:57.631 --> 01:39:58.411
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1940
01:39:58.411 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean you can't be</v>

1941
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:04.470
<v Speaker 3>spiritual and you can't be really just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it doesn't mean you can't</v>

1942
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.800
<v Speaker 3>believe in God or gods or a date that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not ruled out by signs,</v>

1943
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:12.480
<v Speaker 3>but some stuff's ruled out.</v>

1944
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 4>I love the way you communicate this</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it takes into consideration</v>

1945
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:18.990
<v Speaker 4>human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

1946
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:21.510
<v Speaker 4>I love Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fantastic,</v>

1947
01:40:21.511 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 4>I think he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1948
01:40:22.561 --> 01:40:25.800
<v Speaker 4>very valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he likes to call people idiots.</v>

1949
01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And the problem with that is people go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1950
01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 4>You're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is a natural inclination when you</v>

1951
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:37.731
<v Speaker 4>insult people to argue back and to sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of dig their heels in and uh,</v>

1952
01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.390
<v Speaker 4>you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's very important and I</v>

1953
01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:46.200
<v Speaker 4>think that a guy like doc has just gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated from all these years of</v>

1954
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:49.710
<v Speaker 4>debates with people who are uneducated</v>
<v Speaker 4>or saying ridiculous things and he's a</v>

1955
01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:51.130
<v Speaker 4>bit of a curmudgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1956
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 4>when he seems to be softening as he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting older.</v>

1957
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.170
<v Speaker 4>He's an evolutionary</v>

1958
01:40:54.170 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 2>biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1959
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:57.510
<v Speaker 2>the front line in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1960
01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:58.413
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1961
01:40:58.730 --> 01:41:01.720
<v Speaker 2>To think about particle physics is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a lot of shit because</v>

1962
01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:03.530
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1963
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary biology is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I understand his frustration.</v>

1964
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do too.</v>

1965
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1966
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of softened a bit over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>years actually because now I think at</v>

1967
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:20.560
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in the US actually and in Britain</v>

1968
01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 2>and in some of the countries we are a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an a point you've sort of alluded to it</v>

1969
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:29.200
<v Speaker 2>where everybody's angry with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger and a lot of it's justified by the</v>

1970
01:41:29.201 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>way you maybe we could talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1971
01:41:30.641 --> 01:41:33.910
<v Speaker 2>income inequality and all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's justified anger.</v>

1972
01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to me that there are people</v>
<v Speaker 2>of goodwill who need to band together to</v>

1973
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:40.240
<v Speaker 2>diffuse the anger.</v>

1974
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Now Society's otherwise we won't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like the United States is the</v>

1975
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:47.190
<v Speaker 2>United States because it's united and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and you've got the United</v>

1976
01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American flag there.</v>

1977
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:50.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a sense of belonging and</v>

1978
01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:53.950
<v Speaker 2>identity and togetherness in a country</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which you've got to preserve.</v>

1979
01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:57.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I've stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually I'm picking.</v>

1980
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1981
01:41:58.901 --> 01:42:03.901
<v Speaker 2>quite enjoy picking fights with Deepak</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chopra on twitter and it's just fun to</v>

1982
01:42:04.031 --> 01:42:04.770
<v Speaker 2>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1983
01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I need to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy stuff and he's not.</v>

1984
01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.930
<v Speaker 2>But I've almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've stopped doing it going well,</v>

1985
01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 2>but relative to some of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1986
01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.270
<v Speaker 2>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

1987
01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:19.360
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's someone who means he means well,</v>

1988
01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with virtually anything he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says.</v>

1989
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a well meaning person and so I've</v>

1990
01:42:25.421 --> 01:42:27.670
<v Speaker 2>started trying to seek common ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1991
01:42:27.671 --> 01:42:30.370
<v Speaker 2>That's why I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1992
01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 2>gave a talk to the Bishop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me to come here.</v>

1993
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with them on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework,</v>

1994
01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 2>their theological framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they mean well,</v>

1995
01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:39.130
<v Speaker 2>most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:42:39.131 --> 01:42:43.180
<v Speaker 2>So I think seeking consensus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating anger as you said,</v>

1997
01:42:43.181 --> 01:42:45.280
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is incumbent on all of us,</v>

1998
01:42:45.281 --> 01:42:47.530
<v Speaker 2>especially people like us who have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>public voice.</v>

1999
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:51.400
<v Speaker 2>We need to diffuse some of this anger</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it will consume</v>

2000
01:42:51.401 --> 01:42:52.690
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2001
01:42:52.691 --> 01:42:56.260
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried very hard to evolve in that</v>

2002
01:42:56.261 --> 01:42:59.470
<v Speaker 2>respect and just get better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating ideas and get better at</v>

2003
01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:01.630
<v Speaker 2>understanding how people receive those</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2004
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:06.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why it's easy to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy and consult and to.</v>

2005
01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

2006
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.740
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially me.</v>

2007
01:43:11.741 --> 01:43:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm a comedian as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do is insult people,</v>

2008
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:20.050
<v Speaker 2>but for humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to entertain people.</v>

2009
01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole idea behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think in terms of like discussing</v>

2010
01:43:23.801 --> 01:43:27.190
<v Speaker 2>ideas especially that are so personal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like religion.</v>

2011
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2012
01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:31.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've reexamined the way I interpret</v>

2013
01:43:31.361 --> 01:43:33.910
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and the way I talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

2014
01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2015
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.630
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

2016
01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I did a BBC program at age 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asked to do it on the single reith</v>

2017
01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:46.630
<v Speaker 2>lectures at the BBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The BBC had done it is 9:52,</v>

2018
01:43:46.631 --> 01:43:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Robert Oppenheimer did them in 53,</v>

2019
01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

2020
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get the transcripts online.</v>

2021
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 3>They're free and you can get one</v>
<v Speaker 3>recording of the five they taped over</v>

2022
01:43:58.101 --> 01:43:59.450
<v Speaker 3>the other four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you believe it?</v>

2023
01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Why they raised them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they wanted to tape something</v>

2024
01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:06.400
<v Speaker 3>believable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them existed oftentimes are</v>

2025
01:44:06.401 --> 01:44:08.390
<v Speaker 3>giving these lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2026
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:14.260
<v Speaker 3>But you can read it just from Katie and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bedroom.</v>

2027
01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Wrestled him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The types over them.</v>

2028
01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't read Bertrand Russell's</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] tape is so expensive,</v>

2029
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:26.870
<v Speaker 3>but he talks crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's brilliant.</v>

2030
01:44:26.871 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It's called science in the common</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding and they weren't very well</v>

2031
01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:32.750
<v Speaker 3>received because he thought he was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about the Manhattan project,</v>

2032
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.450
<v Speaker 3>so they thought he was going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the atom bomb,</v>

2033
01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was.</v>

2034
01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 3>He ran it basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't.</v>

2035
01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.390
<v Speaker 3>He talks about how thinking like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist,</v>

2036
01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 3>which means thinking in the way that</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature forces you to think can be</v>

2037
01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:48.020
<v Speaker 3>valuable in other areas.</v>

2038
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:50.420
<v Speaker 3>And it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an insight in itself.</v>

2039
01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:53.400
<v Speaker 3>The great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unique thing about science,</v>

2040
01:44:53.401 --> 01:44:56.090
<v Speaker 3>there's nature forces you to think like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2041
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.970
<v Speaker 3>You can't have an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I have an opinion about gravity</v>

2042
01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:01.670
<v Speaker 3>region with building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hit the ground.</v>

2043
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:03.950
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what your opinion is.</v>

2044
01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

2045
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.850
<v Speaker 3>so if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2046
01:45:07.851 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 3>quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sometimes you think of as particles</v>

2047
01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>electron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it has to.</v>

2048
01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:16.970
<v Speaker 3>It's a point like object may behave like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little billy,</v>

2049
01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.370
<v Speaker 3>a ball thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pool ball bands is around,</v>

2050
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes it behaves like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>extended thing,</v>

2051
01:45:22.221 --> 01:45:26.870
<v Speaker 3>like a wavy thing and nature forces you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hold both ideas in your head at the</v>

2052
01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:31.070
<v Speaker 3>same time in order to get a complete</v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of the object,</v>

2053
01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:34.940
<v Speaker 3>the description of an electron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that's the valuable thing</v>

2054
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>about quantum mechanics.</v>

2055
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:38.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're doing electronics or</v>

2056
01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:40.640
<v Speaker 3>inventing lasers and you don't need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know this stuff,</v>

2057
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to learn how to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2058
01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 3>it's valuable to be forced to hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>different ideas in your head.</v>

2059
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 3>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really teaching you not to be an</v>

2060
01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:54.350
<v Speaker 3>absolutist straight teaching you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>example he uses his because he was.</v>

2061
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I think he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had problems with mccarthy and all those</v>

2062
01:45:56.691 --> 01:45:58.260
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he say you think he's still.</v>

2063
01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.680
<v Speaker 3>He's writing in the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he said you can either be,</v>

2064
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:04.610
<v Speaker 3>you can be a communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in his definition would be that</v>

2065
01:46:04.611 --> 01:46:07.520
<v Speaker 3>you think the needs of the many outweigh</v>
<v Speaker 3>the needs of the few.</v>

2066
01:46:07.521 --> 01:46:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So say societies,</v>

2067
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 3>all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it could be a libertarian or right on</v>

2068
01:46:11.811 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 3>the far conservative and where you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the individual is the only thing</v>

2069
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:18.890
<v Speaker 3>that matters and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually of course,</v>

2070
01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 3>to have a functioning society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a mixture of the two and we can</v>

2071
01:46:22.761 --> 01:46:26.270
<v Speaker 3>wait it one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need to hold both ideas in your</v>

2072
01:46:26.271 --> 01:46:29.450
<v Speaker 3>head at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's he said that one of the most</v>

2073
01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:33.920
<v Speaker 3>valuable things about science because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>forces you into modes of thought that</v>

2074
01:46:33.921 --> 01:46:36.160
<v Speaker 3>are valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're talking about here</v>

2075
01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 3>is I'm an absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physicians are always,</v>

2076
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.113
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2077
01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:41.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>

2078
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:44.930
<v Speaker 3>a blinkered sort of subsets of what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happening.</v>

2079
01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't understand the world by being</v>
<v Speaker 3>an extremist.</v>

2080
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 3>You've got to hold</v>

2081
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.160
<v Speaker 2>all these views in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that I find that so often on this</v>

2082
01:46:55.771 --> 01:46:59.760
<v Speaker 2>podcast because I talk with people I</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with and disagree with and I</v>

2083
01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>always try to put myself in the head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that I disagree with.</v>

2084
01:47:03.361 --> 01:47:08.361
<v Speaker 2>I will always try to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're coming to those conclusions are,</v>

2085
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 2>where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's so,</v>

2086
01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to not be married to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2087
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I got a conversation with someone about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and they said sometimes you change</v>

2088
01:47:19.471 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 2>your opinions a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2089
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2090
01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it's a bad thing,</v>

2091
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 2>like I'm flip flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a politician,</v>

2092
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not flip flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

2093
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

2094
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2095
01:47:31.881 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I will have one opinion on a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a controversial thing like</v>

2096
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:38.730
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income and I'll change</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind 100 percent,</v>

2097
01:47:38.770 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 2>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go there and now I think it's</v>

2098
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:41.994
<v Speaker 2>probably a good idea.</v>

2099
01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2100
01:47:44.371 --> 01:47:44.821
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2101
01:47:44.821 --> 01:47:45.151
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2102
01:47:45.151 --> 01:47:48.060
<v Speaker 2>People need eight is cruel as it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need motivation.</v>

2103
01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:49.620
<v Speaker 2>They need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>

2104
01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I bounced around with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 2>But I've tried really hard as I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten older to have less absolute</v>

2106
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2107
01:47:57.330 --> 01:47:59.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Richard fineman another great</v>

2108
01:47:59.371 --> 01:48:03.440
<v Speaker 2>physicist or a similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a similar time to open timer.</v>

2109
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And he also went to the Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 2>project and it's called the value of</v>

2110
01:48:06.421 --> 01:48:08.310
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was 1955.</v>

2111
01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>And they both shared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a,</v>

2112
01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:12.510
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a surprise,</v>

2113
01:48:12.511 --> 01:48:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were still alive because I</v>

2114
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:17.130
<v Speaker 2>thought that the power they'd given to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politicians,</v>

2115
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the atom bomb would destroy everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't think that political system</v>

2116
01:48:21.241 --> 01:48:22.380
<v Speaker 2>would control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it did.</v>

2117
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's an emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malcolm will thing.</v>

2118
01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:26.200
<v Speaker 2>We're still here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>

2119
01:48:26.201 --> 01:48:27.330
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that essay,</v>

2120
01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 2>he said the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2121
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.353
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2122
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:34.680
<v Speaker 2>the most valuable thing about science is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the realization that we don't know.</v>

2123
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said in that statement equals</v>

2124
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:41.130
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Satisfactory philosophy of ignorance.</v>

2125
01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said in that statement is the open</v>

2126
01:48:43.951 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the open channel.</v>

2127
01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:48.210
<v Speaker 2>He called it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we want to make progress,</v>

2128
01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 2>we have to understand that we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and we have to leave things</v>

2129
01:48:53.011 --> 01:48:56.940
<v Speaker 2>to future generations and we can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertain and we can change our minds.</v>

2130
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2131
01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:01.470
<v Speaker 2>that is a great last line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't exactly what he says,</v>

2132
01:49:01.471 --> 01:49:04.320
<v Speaker 2>but he said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our duty as scientists to</v>

2133
01:49:04.321 --> 01:49:08.520
<v Speaker 2>communicate the value of uncertainty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the value of freedom of thought to all</v>

2134
01:49:08.521 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 2>future generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>

2135
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:12.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what freedom means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freedom,</v>

2136
01:49:12.751 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 2>it means the freedom to change your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

2137
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:17.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what democracy is.</v>

2138
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy is a trial and error system,</v>

2139
01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:21.360
<v Speaker 2>so it's the.</v>

2140
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.330
<v Speaker 2>It's the admission that we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do.</v>

2141
01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:27.750
<v Speaker 2>It therefore will change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every four years will change.</v>

2142
01:49:27.751 --> 01:49:29.910
<v Speaker 2>The president over the eight years will</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the president.</v>

2143
01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the president doesn't know how</v>

2144
01:49:32.491 --> 01:49:34.680
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone better.</v>

2145
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.970
<v Speaker 2>There will be someone better that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>along and then someone worse and someone</v>

2146
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:40.860
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a trial and error system and</v>

2147
01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:43.290
<v Speaker 2>he's right and it is right that that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the open door.</v>

2148
01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the road to progress is certainly</v>

2149
01:49:46.681 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 2>better than humility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:51.360
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I love so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Bertrand Russell and about five</v>

2151
01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:54.960
<v Speaker 2>was how human they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were very human means fireman,</v>

2152
01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:59.650
<v Speaker 2>like to play the Bongos and chasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and Bertrand Russell was addicted</v>

2153
01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:03.040
<v Speaker 2>to tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would talk about how he wouldn't fly</v>

2154
01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 2>unless he could smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he had to get us back when they had</v>

2155
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 2>smoking sections on airplanes and he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>his pipe and he just refused to fly</v>

2156
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:15.250
<v Speaker 2>without tobacco and couldn't imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>being without tobacco and like that's so</v>

2157
01:50:15.251 --> 01:50:19.450
<v Speaker 2>strange because just a brilliant guy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be addicted to such a gross thing.</v>

2158
01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2159
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Because I think these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people that found existence.</v>

2160
01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Joyous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2161
01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:27.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll need to know.</v>

2162
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.270
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted to know stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to know everything because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't know everything.</v>

2164
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose that's what you think</v>

2165
01:50:34.991 --> 01:50:37.330
<v Speaker 2>about what the job of a scientist is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to.</v>

2166
01:50:37.331 --> 01:50:42.070
<v Speaker 2>It's to stand on the edge of the known</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're a research scientist,</v>

2167
01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 2>so if there's nothing to note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got no job.</v>

2168
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be naturally comfortable</v>

2169
01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:49.310
<v Speaker 2>with not knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2170
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:52.170
<v Speaker 2>if there's one thing I really do think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

2171
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 2>How do we begin to patch our countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>back up again?</v>

2172
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:59.590
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I think in education</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to teach people the value of</v>

2173
01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:04.060
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of not knowing it is not weak to not</v>

2174
01:51:04.061 --> 01:51:08.200
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually natural not to know.</v>

2175
01:51:08.630 --> 01:51:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of them is with religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to say that you know,</v>

2176
01:51:11.981 --> 01:51:15.730
<v Speaker 2>when you do not hard to say that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have absolute truth and absolute</v>

2177
01:51:15.731 --> 01:51:16.720
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of something.</v>

2178
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it can't really exist.</v>

2179
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:19.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2180
01:51:19.151 --> 01:51:20.260
<v Speaker 2>history tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it,</v>

2181
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:24.310
<v Speaker 2>that anyone who thinks they've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute knowledge is a causes trouble.</v>

2182
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see x marketer?</v>

2183
01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you enjoy it?</v>

2184
01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:29.891
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2185
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Alex Garland.</v>

2186
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:35.470
<v Speaker 2>Sunshine over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was right in 28 days later.</v>

2187
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:38.290
<v Speaker 2>And the new movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Weird One,</v>

2188
01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.760
<v Speaker 2>the alien movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote that as well.</v>

2189
01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2190
01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 2>dilation and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2191
01:51:43.961 --> 01:51:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Sandra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:51:45.130 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2193
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:48.970
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you scared of artificial life?</v>

2194
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Elan Musk scare the shit out of me.</v>

2195
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he talked about it.</v>

2196
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks about it like we're in the</v>

2197
01:51:58.211 --> 01:52:03.040
<v Speaker 2>opening scene of a science fiction movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's trying to warn people and</v>

2198
01:52:03.041 --> 01:52:06.550
<v Speaker 2>then they don't listen to the genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it goes south,</v>

2199
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 2>sort of depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chaired a debate on this society in</v>

2200
01:52:12.011 --> 01:52:14.680
<v Speaker 2>London a few weeks ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2201
01:52:15.250 --> 01:52:18.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's true now at the moment what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people tend to be frightened of a</v>

2202
01:52:18.621 --> 01:52:22.030
<v Speaker 2>general ai's or Agi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called artificial general</v>

2203
01:52:22.031 --> 01:52:24.190
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like what we talked about</v>

2204
01:52:24.191 --> 01:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human like capability thing.</v>

2205
01:52:26.981 --> 01:52:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2206
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and we're miles away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how to do it.</v>

2207
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:35.650
<v Speaker 2>We haven't got them and we miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the moment artificial intelligence</v>

2208
01:52:35.651 --> 01:52:39.700
<v Speaker 2>is expert systems and very focused</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that do particular things.</v>

2209
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:44.800
<v Speaker 2>You can be scared of them in a limited</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic sense because they're going to</v>

2210
01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:47.300
<v Speaker 2>displace people's jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>

2211
01:52:47.301 --> 01:52:49.040
<v Speaker 2>interestingly in this panel discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

2212
01:52:49.041 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like what you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>call middle class jobs in the UK,</v>

2213
01:52:52.401 --> 01:52:57.320
<v Speaker 2>so white collar jobs because people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in universal basic income to</v>

2214
01:52:57.321 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 2>sort of replace money that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be lost because there will be no jobs</v>

2215
01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>for all these people.</v>

2216
01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we have just a mask attached.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2217
01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:06.950
<v Speaker 2>they're very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said that these systems,</v>

2218
01:53:06.951 --> 01:53:09.530
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence systems at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment are very good at doing things</v>

2219
01:53:09.531 --> 01:53:12.320
<v Speaker 2>like law lawyers work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're very good at reading</v>

2220
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:14.600
<v Speaker 2>contracts and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's interesting.</v>

2221
01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the industrial revolution.</v>

2222
01:53:17.211 --> 01:53:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Where is manual labor that gets hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily?</v>

2223
01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits that kind of intermediate level</v>

2224
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 2>that usually escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're right,</v>

2225
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.330
<v Speaker 2>one of the answers is to tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an example was a robot tax.</v>

2226
01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 2>So in a car factory you say to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer,</v>

2227
01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:35.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2228
01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you can have a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you pay the robot the same as you</v>

2229
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 2>pay a person and then that money goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into funding universal basic income or</v>

2230
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's got to be an economic</v>

2231
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 2>change because these systems will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2232
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:52.390
<v Speaker 2>but all the experts I spoke to agreed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea of a terminator style,</v>

2233
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:57.380
<v Speaker 2>General Intelligence taking over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world is miles away.</v>

2234
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whilst we might start thinking about</v>

2235
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 2>the regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen soon,</v>

2236
01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:08.150
<v Speaker 2>is the general point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2237
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:11.800
<v Speaker 2>So I would disagree with him on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2238
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it's too far in the future at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

2239
01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be one of those people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an ad.</v>

2240
01:54:16.821 --> 01:54:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then then,</v>

2241
01:54:18.281 --> 01:54:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my iphone takes me out on the way to</v>

2242
01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.133
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like choice at the moment,</v>

2244
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:25.641
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2245
01:54:25.641 --> 01:54:27.710
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give your phone a laser,</v>

2246
01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter if it goes crazy</v>

2247
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:32.860
<v Speaker 2>and tries to take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2248
01:54:32.861 --> 01:54:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a bit facetious because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can see.</v>

2249
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:37.880
<v Speaker 2>He would say they could take other power</v>
<v Speaker 2>grids and all that kind of stuff.</v>

2250
01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's these concepts that are really hard</v>

2251
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.410
<v Speaker 2>to visualize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sora Kurzweil's idea of the</v>

2252
01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:49.910
<v Speaker 2>exponential increase of technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading us to a point in the near</v>

2253
01:54:49.911 --> 01:54:50.570
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

2254
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>download your consciousness into a</v>

2255
01:54:52.491 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 2>computer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked to computer experts.</v>

2256
01:54:54.531 --> 01:54:55.311
<v Speaker 2>It like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

2257
01:54:55.311 --> 01:54:57.590
<v Speaker 2>We're miles away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neuroscientists,</v>

2258
01:54:58.070 --> 01:55:02.600
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you knew one brain cell,</v>

2259
01:55:02.601 --> 01:55:05.900
<v Speaker 2>probably we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Kurzweil's convinced that what's</v>

2260
01:55:05.901 --> 01:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>going to happen is that as technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>increases and increases in this wildly</v>

2261
01:55:10.461 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 2>exponential way where we really can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>visualize it,</v>

2262
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.560
<v Speaker 2>we can't even imagine how much</v>
<v Speaker 2>advancement will take place over 50</v>

2263
01:55:18.561 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in those 50 years,</v>

2264
01:55:20.511 --> 01:55:24.200
<v Speaker 2>something's going to happen that</v>
<v Speaker 2>radically changes our idea of what's</v>

2265
01:55:24.201 --> 01:55:27.920
<v Speaker 2>possible and I think Elon shares this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea as well that it's going to sneak up</v>

2266
01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:30.410
<v Speaker 2>on us so quickly that when it does go</v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

2267
01:55:30.411 --> 01:55:31.760
<v Speaker 2>it'll be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's worth putting the framework</v>
<v Speaker 2>in place.</v>

2269
01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I think the regulatory framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as you said,</v>

2270
01:55:37.911 --> 01:55:40.550
<v Speaker 2>for the more realistic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is people's jobs are going to get</v>

2271
01:55:40.551 --> 01:55:43.700
<v Speaker 2>displaced and that there's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2272
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>was at a thing in some segments that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and it was,</v>

2273
01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:49.020
<v Speaker 2>but they said that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a politician that the job of the</v>

2274
01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:53.100
<v Speaker 2>innovation system is to create jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than it destroys them.</v>

2275
01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 2>So you've always got to remember that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a government and as regulators,</v>

2276
01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:01.170
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to allow technologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the marketplace that destroy</v>

2277
01:56:01.171 --> 01:56:04.650
<v Speaker 2>people's jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is your responsibility to find a way</v>

2278
01:56:04.651 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 2>of replacing those jobs or compensate in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people,</v>

2279
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.370
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the breakdown,</v>

2280
01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>

2281
01:56:11.911 --> 01:56:16.860
<v Speaker 2>those that people need some meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they just giving them income I</v>

2282
01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:19.610
<v Speaker 2>think is just gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

2283
01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just my speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's going to create massive spare</v>

2284
01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.460
<v Speaker 2>even if provide them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you provide them with food and shelter,</v>

2285
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:31.380
<v Speaker 2>they need people need things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's going to be some sort of a</v>

2286
01:56:31.381 --> 01:56:36.150
<v Speaker 2>demand to find meaning for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them occupations,</v>

2287
01:56:36.151 --> 01:56:38.370
<v Speaker 2>give them something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some task,</v>

2288
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:42.360
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be one of the critical parts</v>

2289
01:56:42.361 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 2>of being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need things to do that we find</v>

2290
01:56:45.841 --> 01:56:47.160
<v Speaker 2>meaning in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2291
01:56:47.161 --> 01:56:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like you were talking about were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only things that we know of that have</v>

2292
01:56:50.731 --> 01:56:53.970
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that find meaning and sharing meaning</v>

2293
01:56:53.971 --> 01:56:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and believe in that we're gonna need</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2294
01:56:57.570 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 2>If universal basic income comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to be enough to</v>

2295
01:57:01.171 --> 01:57:04.710
<v Speaker 2>just feed people and house them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna want something to do.</v>

2296
01:57:04.711 --> 01:57:05.780
<v Speaker 2>If a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2297
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:07.140
<v Speaker 2>a person is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2298
01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 2>you're doing something for an occupation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is your identity.</v>

2299
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden that occupation</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes irrelevant because computer does</v>

2300
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper,</v>

2301
01:57:15.181 --> 01:57:18.210
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are going to have this</v>

2302
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 2>incredible feeling of despair and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being valuable.</v>

2303
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2304
01:57:23.481 --> 01:57:23.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2305
01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the utopian.</v>

2306
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So the version of this is to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to do what we're doing,</v>

2307
01:57:28.621 --> 01:57:33.020
<v Speaker 2>now she's make a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thinking and creating that kind of,</v>

2308
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:35.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that that's the Utopian ideal is you</v>

2309
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:39.720
<v Speaker 2>don't need to do the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The job that you don't really want to do</v>

2310
01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:41.400
<v Speaker 2>in the factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2311
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:44.540
<v Speaker 2>You can do the thing that humans are</v>
<v Speaker 2>best at that,</v>

2312
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:45.653
<v Speaker 2>but I agree.</v>

2313
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:50.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a very utopian view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everybody want to do that?</v>

2314
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Or does everybody have their mindset</v>
<v Speaker 2>will maybe goes to education if</v>

2315
01:57:54.271 --> 01:57:58.680
<v Speaker 2>everybody had an interest like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everybody went on to make pottery and</v>

2316
01:57:58.681 --> 01:58:01.950
<v Speaker 2>painting and doing all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they've always really wanted to</v>

2317
01:58:01.951 --> 01:58:06.951
<v Speaker 2>do and their needs are met by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income money that they</v>

2318
01:58:07.081 --> 01:58:09.630
<v Speaker 2>receive every month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>

2319
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>have those desires or needs and to sort</v>

2320
01:58:13.651 --> 01:58:17.310
<v Speaker 2>of force them onto them at age 55 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it's going to be.</v>

2321
01:58:17.610 --> 01:58:19.560
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

2322
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2323
01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big challenge,</v>

2324
01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:30.080
<v Speaker 2>but I think that in concept at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable that we do have some</v>

2325
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:35.361
<v Speaker 2>sort of an artificial intelligence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>resembles us or that resembles something</v>

2326
01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:39.570
<v Speaker 2>like x mark and if people choose to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create that,</v>

2327
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 2>we could choose create it in our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>image.</v>

2328
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 3>But that's very godlike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2329
01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:46.780
<v Speaker 3>God created us in his own image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.681
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2331
01:58:47.681 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that when I talk to people</v>

2332
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 3>in the field as you probably are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them say don't have to do it.</v>

2333
01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

2334
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:03.010
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I'm hiding my head in the sand</v>

2335
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.990
<v Speaker 3>a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think so.</v>

2336
01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll know it when I don't think</v>

2337
01:59:09.011 --> 01:59:13.060
<v Speaker 3>anyone's going to do it accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think it's just suddenly</v>

2338
01:59:13.061 --> 01:59:14.210
<v Speaker 3>going to be upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2339
01:59:14.250 --> 01:59:17.460
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we will see it will,</v>

2340
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:20.980
<v Speaker 3>we will see ourselves getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acquiring that capability.</v>

2341
01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:24.310
<v Speaker 3>We'll see ourselves getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see their systems beginning to</v>

2342
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:28.900
<v Speaker 3>emerge and then we will think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 200 years ago,</v>

2343
01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:31.990
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted a photograph or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a picture of something you had</v>

2344
01:59:31.991 --> 01:59:32.824
<v Speaker 3>to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

2345
01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:34.650
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>

2346
01:59:34.650 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 4>there was no photography 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2347
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean just think of that is almost</v>
<v Speaker 4>inconceivable.</v>

2348
01:59:42.630 --> 01:59:44.700
<v Speaker 4>No automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no photography.</v>

2349
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:47.820
<v Speaker 4>What was automobile?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there was some sort of machines</v>

2350
01:59:47.821 --> 01:59:48.990
<v Speaker 4>that drove people around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2351
01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:52.440
<v Speaker 4>Something close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was earlier than that,</v>

2352
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:54.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back 500 years,</v>

2353
01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.210
<v Speaker 4>you have almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2354
01:59:56.490 --> 01:59:58.110
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are we being quick?</v>

2355
01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:01.110
<v Speaker 4>So fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fast.</v>

2356
02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:02.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this,</v>

2357
02:00:02.221 --> 02:00:05.100
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people right now in their car</v>

2358
02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:08.070
<v Speaker 4>that are streaming this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're in their car and they're</v>

2359
02:00:08.071 --> 02:00:09.420
<v Speaker 4>listening as they're driving on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>

2360
02:00:09.421 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they have a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they have an electric car.</v>

2361
02:00:12.570 --> 02:00:16.800
<v Speaker 4>They're driving down the road streaming</v>
<v Speaker 4>to people talking where it's ones and</v>

2362
02:00:16.801 --> 02:00:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Zeros that are broken down and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>some audible form and you can listen to</v>

2363
02:00:21.361 --> 02:00:23.370
<v Speaker 4>it in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is</v>

2364
02:00:24.230 --> 02:00:25.340
<v Speaker 3>bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2365
02:00:26.090 --> 02:00:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been quick so quick.</v>

2366
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.911
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they will,</v>

2367
02:00:28.911 --> 02:00:29.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

2368
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.823
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

2369
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:32.870
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not long.</v>

2370
02:00:32.871 --> 02:00:37.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember it being invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well certainly the web,</v>

2371
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:41.630
<v Speaker 3>so the web,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it was very early for me because I</v>

2372
02:00:41.631 --> 02:00:44.690
<v Speaker 3>was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particle physics and of course the</v>

2373
02:00:44.691 --> 02:00:47.510
<v Speaker 3>web comes from certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the www bit,</v>

2374
02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.910
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it certainly in the early nineties I</v>

2375
02:00:49.911 --> 02:00:52.970
<v Speaker 3>was involved in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2376
02:00:53.050 --> 02:00:53.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2377
02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:56.390
<v Speaker 3>in the university environment with email</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that kind of stuff.</v>

2378
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it kind of didn't</v>

2379
02:00:59.181 --> 02:01:00.780
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have,</v>

2380
02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.370
<v Speaker 3>you could have a web browser that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only sites that were there and Nasa</v>

2381
02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:06.860
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think NASA edited one of the early</v>

2382
02:01:06.861 --> 02:01:09.080
<v Speaker 3>sites and cern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very loud.</v>

2383
02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 3>When did you become involved with siren?</v>

2384
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:16.280
<v Speaker 3>So that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started doing particle physics in 95.</v>

2385
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:19.640
<v Speaker 3>And when was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did the large Hadron collider go</v>

2386
02:01:19.641 --> 02:01:20.840
<v Speaker 3>live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

2387
02:01:20.841 --> 02:01:23.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was 2000 and</v>

2388
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:29.030
<v Speaker 3>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was 2008 is so long ago.</v>

2389
02:01:29.031 --> 02:01:32.050
<v Speaker 3>That was about 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he started out,</v>

2390
02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:35.480
<v Speaker 3>we started off and then we had a problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it and then it took a while to fix.</v>

2391
02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hasn't been taking data that long,</v>

2392
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:42.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's a tremendously successful thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and it's,</v>

2393
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:45.290
<v Speaker 3>it's operating beyond this design</v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

2394
02:01:45.291 --> 02:01:48.610
<v Speaker 3>It's quite incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so stunning is an incredible thing</v>

2395
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 3>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2396
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:52.730
<v Speaker 3>how large is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long has the largest is 27</v>

2397
02:01:52.731 --> 02:01:54.830
<v Speaker 3>kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd say about 16 miles.</v>

2398
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Sixteen miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a circular.</v>

2399
02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a building.</v>

2400
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2401
02:01:59.250 --> 02:02:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I say it's a big tube and mean you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically it's mainly under France and</v>

2402
02:02:03.201 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 3>partly into Switzerland and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerates protons around in a circle</v>

2403
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.910
<v Speaker 3>both ways that won't.</v>

2404
02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:11.720
<v Speaker 3>One beam goes well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My one goes either way and they go round</v>

2405
02:02:11.721 --> 02:02:15.120
<v Speaker 3>11,000 times a second because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>very close.</v>

2406
02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 3>The speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 nine point nine,</v>

2407
02:02:16.671 --> 02:02:17.120
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

2408
02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:17.601
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

2409
02:02:17.601 --> 02:02:18.740
<v Speaker 3>nine percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The speed of light.</v>

2410
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 3>And then we crossed the beams and</v>
<v Speaker 3>collide the particles.</v>

2411
02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And in those collisions you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreating the conditions that were</v>

2412
02:02:25.281 --> 02:02:28.310
<v Speaker 3>present or less than a billionth of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second after the big bang.</v>

2413
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So we know that physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so going back,</v>

2414
02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 3>reset about the carbon and the oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can trace that story back way beyond</v>

2415
02:02:36.921 --> 02:02:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the time when they were protons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutrons to when they were quarks and</v>

2416
02:02:40.491 --> 02:02:45.491
<v Speaker 3>gluons around and go all the way back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Higgs on doing its thing back</v>

2417
02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:50.120
<v Speaker 3>then and so we can see all that physics</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the lab.</v>

2418
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:54.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's why we have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of confidence in that story.</v>

2419
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:58.620
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating that they were able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk someone into funding that,</v>

2420
02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.740
<v Speaker 3>that they got a bunch of people together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you,</v>

2421
02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:07.120
<v Speaker 3>you were able to explain to politicians</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2422
02:03:07.170 --> 02:03:09.800
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular people,</v>

2423
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:11.420
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're trying to do.</v>

2424
02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.200
<v Speaker 3>He a great example of how you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>something done.</v>

2425
02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:18.440
<v Speaker 3>So it was the night in the fifties when</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain was established,</v>

2426
02:03:18.441 --> 02:03:21.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 53 or 54,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't quite remember it.</v>

2427
02:03:21.541 --> 02:03:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2428
02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:28.720
<v Speaker 3>it was bill from the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so at the end of the war and it was</v>

2429
02:03:28.791 --> 02:03:33.410
<v Speaker 3>realized that the only way forward for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe was collaboration to rebuild the</v>

2430
02:03:33.411 --> 02:03:38.030
<v Speaker 3>scientific base and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for peace for peaceful purposes.</v>

2431
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:41.580
<v Speaker 3>And so certain was set up as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>international collaboration in Europe</v>

2432
02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 3>initially with that political ideal that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>

2433
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 3>it would explore nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2434
02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:49.670
<v Speaker 3>just for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

2435
02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 3>for freely and for peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for peaceful means,</v>

2436
02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.093
<v Speaker 3>peaceful reasons.</v>

2437
02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.550
<v Speaker 3>And so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2438
02:03:57.150 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the politics was right.</v>

2439
02:03:58.701 --> 02:04:03.701
<v Speaker 3>So we set it by international treaty so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the member states are bound</v>

2440
02:04:03.831 --> 02:04:06.830
<v Speaker 3>together by a treaty and they pay a</v>
<v Speaker 3>small amount,</v>

2441
02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:09.380
<v Speaker 3>relatively small amount each into</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain every year,</v>

2442
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:13.790
<v Speaker 3>which is a percentage of their GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the money they used to build</v>

2443
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.530
<v Speaker 3>the experiments and build the</v>
<v Speaker 3>accelerators.</v>

2444
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:20.420
<v Speaker 3>So it's very hard to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you wouldn't really want to because</v>

2445
02:04:20.421 --> 02:04:24.680
<v Speaker 3>it's a small amount of money per country</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stern doesn't get extra money to</v>

2446
02:04:24.681 --> 02:04:27.440
<v Speaker 3>build things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just takes his money and basically</v>

2447
02:04:27.441 --> 02:04:30.740
<v Speaker 3>saved up and plans itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because it's got a regular stream of</v>

2448
02:04:30.741 --> 02:04:32.650
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can do it so you can say we're going</v>

2449
02:04:32.651 --> 02:04:35.750
<v Speaker 3>to build this machine and it will take</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years because that's how much</v>

2450
02:04:35.751 --> 02:04:38.760
<v Speaker 3>money we've got now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility in eight years and we know how</v>

2451
02:04:38.761 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 3>much money we've got so we can do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2452
02:04:40.690 --> 02:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>It's less than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the reason that the US collider,</v>

2453
02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:48.330
<v Speaker 3>the SSC failed is because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem you have in the us with the</v>

2454
02:04:48.721 --> 02:04:51.630
<v Speaker 3>funding system as you've seen in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last few weeks,</v>

2455
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 3>is that it's very arbitrary and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>open to political maneuvering and things</v>

2456
02:04:56.761 --> 02:04:59.700
<v Speaker 3>can be shut down and take an uncertain</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not like that.</v>

2457
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Cerner has got a guaranteed stream of</v>
<v Speaker 3>funding small from each country and so</v>

2458
02:05:05.521 --> 02:05:08.520
<v Speaker 3>you can do these projects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the one in the US that was during</v>

2459
02:05:08.521 --> 02:05:09.870
<v Speaker 3>the Clinton administration is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

2460
02:05:09.871 --> 02:05:11.280
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2461
02:05:11.281 --> 02:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was it Clinton.</v>

2462
02:05:13.170 --> 02:05:18.170
<v Speaker 3>It was closed down by Congress and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very slim vote and it was in Texas,</v>

2463
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 3>so it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those things where you've</v>

2464
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:26.430
<v Speaker 3>got states vying for money and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>half built and everyone was there,</v>

2465
02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:27.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing,</v>

2466
02:05:27.391 --> 02:05:30.300
<v Speaker 3>it was bigger than the LHC and it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday.</v>

2467
02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:34.140
<v Speaker 3>So you waste a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a huge disappointment for</v>

2468
02:05:34.141 --> 02:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>scientific community?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where people very hopeful that this</v>

2469
02:05:36.481 --> 02:05:38.610
<v Speaker 3>was going to go live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was being built.</v>

2470
02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 3>So it doug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half the tunnel.</v>

2471
02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:43.120
<v Speaker 3>What would it be able to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The LHC could.</v>

2472
02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>It was a higher energy accelerated in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the LHC.</v>

2473
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:47.970
<v Speaker 3>So it would have discovered the higgs</v>
<v Speaker 3>particle first.</v>

2474
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had it been running,</v>

2475
02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the half bill part,</v>

2476
02:05:52.591 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 3>is it useless now or can they charge it</v>
<v Speaker 3>up again now?</v>

2477
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 3>I think they filled in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2478
02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just half a tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2479
02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.580
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do these wonderful things for</v>

2480
02:06:05.581 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 3>not a lot of money if you just do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>over many years now.</v>

2481
02:06:10.501 --> 02:06:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Stable funding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2482
02:06:11.890 --> 02:06:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Commit to doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The filling in,</v>

2483
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:15.480
<v Speaker 3>in part slurry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at cern as well,</v>

2484
02:06:15.481 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 3>and people.</v>

2485
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People ask me now,</v>

2486
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I think the UK pays about $100,000,000 a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

2487
02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 3>That's what the UK pays in and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>about St Germany,</v>

2488
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:27.060
<v Speaker 3>same two friends and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people say,</v>

2489
02:06:27.061 --> 02:06:28.070
<v Speaker 3>what do we get for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2490
02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.870
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the whole budget seven is about</v>

2491
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 3>the same as a budget of a medium sized</v>
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

2492
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:37.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about a billion dollars a year or</v>

2493
02:06:37.141 --> 02:06:40.200
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what a university has.</v>

2494
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:42.750
<v Speaker 3>So there's not a lot in the scheme of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2495
02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what has it done though?</v>

2496
02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we invented the World Wide Web,</v>

2497
02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:49.860
<v Speaker 3>as we've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the medical imaging technology</v>

2498
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:53.640
<v Speaker 3>that we use comes from cern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pioneered the use of these very high</v>

2499
02:06:53.641 --> 02:06:57.900
<v Speaker 3>field magnet switch is what it needed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's engineering at the edge and</v>

2500
02:06:57.901 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 3>engineering at the edge generates</v>
<v Speaker 3>spinoffs and expertise to get used in</v>

2501
02:07:02.161 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 3>other fields.</v>

2502
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So it's cancer treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so called Hadron beam therapy.</v>

2503
02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:09.900
<v Speaker 3>So if you got a brain tumor now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite likely that you'll have one</v>

2504
02:07:09.901 --> 02:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>of these targeted particle beam</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapies,</v>

2505
02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:15.720
<v Speaker 3>which is like very highly targeted sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of chemotherapy.</v>

2506
02:07:15.721 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 3>It's not chemotherapy radiation you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>target in a beam into your head and</v>

2507
02:07:20.371 --> 02:07:24.480
<v Speaker 3>attack the tumor and those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are particle accelerators.</v>

2508
02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 3>So most pathway accelerators today here</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hospitals and in medicine,</v>

2509
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:33.440
<v Speaker 3>but they came from doing particle</v>
<v Speaker 3>physics that.</v>

2510
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:34.650
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2511
02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:39.670
<v Speaker 3>the of these big experiments at the edge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our capability are always immense,</v>

2512
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 3>which is why they're worth funding at</v>
<v Speaker 3>these very low levels.</v>

2513
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:48.460
<v Speaker 3>But it's not just the knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the engineering expertise that</v>

2514
02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:51.060
<v Speaker 3>there is a practical application for</v>
<v Speaker 3>every everyday.</v>

2515
02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 3>They're always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just finding out how to do hard</v>

2516
02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:56.950
<v Speaker 3>things is usually useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moral,</v>

2517
02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:00.370
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't just the Higgs Boson</v>
<v Speaker 3>particle that you guys had discovered.</v>

2518
02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>What is cork glue on plasma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2519
02:08:03.621 --> 02:08:04.540
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's um,</v>

2520
02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:08.320
<v Speaker 3>shortly after the billionth of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the big bang.</v>

2521
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:13.321
<v Speaker 3>So you end up with a soup of quarks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gluons quarks are the building blocks of</v>

2522
02:08:13.721 --> 02:08:17.320
<v Speaker 3>protons and neutrons and glue onto the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that stick them together.</v>

2523
02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:22.300
<v Speaker 3>And so a proton as to up quarks and down</v>
<v Speaker 3>quark and in each and stu down quarks</v>

2524
02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:24.340
<v Speaker 3>and up quark and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that the constituents,</v>

2525
02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:26.980
<v Speaker 3>the protons and neutrons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are their constituents of our</v>

2526
02:08:26.981 --> 02:08:31.150
<v Speaker 3>atomic nuclei and savy go if you get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high temperatures,</v>

2527
02:08:31.151 --> 02:08:33.880
<v Speaker 3>are high energies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the protons and neutrons falter</v>

2528
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:37.570
<v Speaker 3>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you end up with a soup of quarks</v>

2529
02:08:37.571 --> 02:08:42.160
<v Speaker 3>and gluons that's acquired gluon plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's insanely dense,</v>

2530
02:08:42.161 --> 02:08:43.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2531
02:08:43.241 --> 02:08:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high energy.</v>

2532
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:45.850
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2533
02:08:45.850 --> 02:08:48.470
<v Speaker 3>so you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've been exploring that bite.</v>

2534
02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Could we.</v>

2535
02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:53.960
<v Speaker 3>We don't only collide protons together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can collide a lead nuclei together or</v>

2536
02:08:54.011 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 3>silver nuclei together at the LHC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when you make these kind of suit,</v>

2537
02:08:58.870 --> 02:09:01.270
<v Speaker 3>civil nuclear matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

2538
02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:05.470
<v Speaker 3>very hot nuclear matter to explore that</v>
<v Speaker 3>physics to that and that nuclear</v>

2539
02:09:05.471 --> 02:09:09.550
<v Speaker 3>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was reading something about the</v>

2540
02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:14.660
<v Speaker 3>weight of that stuff that like a sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>cube.</v>

2541
02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:16.261
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

2542
02:09:16.261 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 3>what is the actual weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where defends our density is.</v>

2543
02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:21.600
<v Speaker 3>So don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2544
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing I remember is the sugar cube</v>

2545
02:09:24.321 --> 02:09:27.010
<v Speaker 3>of a neutron star material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2546
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:30.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many hundred million</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons I can,</v>

2547
02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:31.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends,</v>

2548
02:09:31.961 --> 02:09:33.680
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know where the quite glum</v>

2549
02:09:33.710 --> 02:09:34.940
<v Speaker 3>plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what number you're.</v>

2550
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:39.220
<v Speaker 3>There was something that was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things after the discovery they were</v>

2551
02:09:39.221 --> 02:09:44.221
<v Speaker 3>talking about the massive weight of</v>
<v Speaker 3>court gluon plasma in like almost</v>

2552
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:45.970
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible.</v>

2553
02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:46.811
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2554
02:09:46.811 --> 02:09:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the number but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something crazy.</v>

2555
02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:49.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2556
02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Now one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once these,</v>

2557
02:09:53.130 --> 02:09:54.490
<v Speaker 3>you got something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2558
02:09:54.491 --> 02:09:56.160
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty billion million.</v>

2559
02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cubic centimeter would weigh 40</v>

2560
02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 3>billion tons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2561
02:10:02.170 --> 02:10:04.990
<v Speaker 3>good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

2562
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know David actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2563
02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:11.380
<v Speaker 3>The dentist matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creating the big bang machine.</v>

2564
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clothes for engineering and</v>

2565
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 3>upgrades and upgrades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2566
02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing we trying to do is one of the</v>

2567
02:10:20.771 --> 02:10:24.790
<v Speaker 3>things in particle physics is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want as many collisions per second as</v>

2568
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:29.550
<v Speaker 3>you can generate and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a collision wherever.</v>

2569
02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:33.130
<v Speaker 3>What's got a bunch crossing Lhc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can vary,</v>

2570
02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's something like 25 Nano seconds</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on what it's really.</v>

2571
02:10:37.210 --> 02:10:41.390
<v Speaker 3>We get a lot of collisions per second</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the more collisions per second you</v>

2572
02:10:41.391 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 3>can get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more chance you have a make an</v>

2573
02:10:44.061 --> 02:10:48.020
<v Speaker 3>interest in things like higgs particles</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever else may be out there</v>

2574
02:10:48.170 --> 02:10:49.070
<v Speaker 3>waiting to be discovered.</v>

2575
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's possible there are other particles</v>

2576
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:54.770
<v Speaker 3>out there that we haven't yet discovered</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be within the reach of the</v>

2577
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:59.771
<v Speaker 3>LHC and if this one that was in Texas</v>
<v Speaker 3>had gotten built and it was more</v>

2578
02:11:00.021 --> 02:11:03.470
<v Speaker 3>powerful than the Lhc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have even more opportunity to do</v>

2579
02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:04.320
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2580
02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.540
<v Speaker 3>Now when these things are created by</v>
<v Speaker 3>these collisions,</v>

2581
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:11.150
<v Speaker 3>how long do they last?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2582
02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.970
<v Speaker 3>fractions of a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that the general rule in physics and</v>

2583
02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:20.570
<v Speaker 3>particle physics is that the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive it is and the more things it can</v>

2584
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:22.550
<v Speaker 3>decay into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the faster it'll do that.</v>

2585
02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 3>And so basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heavy things decay into light things</v>

2586
02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:29.150
<v Speaker 3>and so the only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stable particles,</v>

2587
02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:34.190
<v Speaker 3>things like electrons</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of the quarks and the up quarks</v>

2588
02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:37.430
<v Speaker 3>and down quarks is stable things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2589
02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.950
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everything tends to decay very fast.</v>

2590
02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.860
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking fractioned billions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second fractions.</v>

2591
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And how are they less than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they registering it's existence.</v>

2592
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is being used to measure it?</v>

2593
02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:56.090
<v Speaker 3>So what you see if you collide the adhc</v>
<v Speaker 3>we collide protons together,</v>

2594
02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:58.010
<v Speaker 3>then president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got loads of stuff in them,</v>

2595
02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:01.130
<v Speaker 3>loads of gluons quarks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2596
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 3>big mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all.</v>

2597
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:07.100
<v Speaker 3>So most of it's a load of particles or</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray now we should not interested in.</v>

2598
02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:10.730
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when let's say a couple of the glue on</v>

2599
02:12:10.731 --> 02:12:15.050
<v Speaker 3>was banging together and they can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>something interesting like a top quark</v>

2600
02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:17.640
<v Speaker 3>or a higgs particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a top court?</v>

2601
02:12:17.690 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very heavy.</v>

2602
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:21.980
<v Speaker 3>There's six quarks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's up and down chairman,</v>

2603
02:12:21.981 --> 02:12:26.981
<v Speaker 3>strange bottom and top farm and strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange was literally in the,</v>

2604
02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:32.050
<v Speaker 3>was it the fifties I discovered them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone said that's really strange and</v>

2605
02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.220
<v Speaker 3>strange and new kind of farcical.</v>

2606
02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:38.000
<v Speaker 3>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have six quarks and they're in three</v>

2607
02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 3>families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the up and down or one family,</v>

2608
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:42.470
<v Speaker 3>and then the chairman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger,</v>

2609
02:12:42.471 --> 02:12:44.660
<v Speaker 3>another family in the top and bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third family.</v>

2610
02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.290
<v Speaker 3>And so we for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the only thing the only fast because</v>

2611
02:12:48.291 --> 02:12:51.710
<v Speaker 3>we need to make up you and me are up</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarks down quarks and electrons,</v>

2612
02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:56.450
<v Speaker 3>but for some reason there are two</v>
<v Speaker 3>further copies of those which are</v>

2613
02:12:56.451 --> 02:12:58.490
<v Speaker 3>identical in every way except they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavier.</v>

2614
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:02.580
<v Speaker 3>So there's the charm and the strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>quark and if they're in a heavy electron</v>

2615
02:13:02.581 --> 02:13:05.090
<v Speaker 3>called immune,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a the top and the</v>

2616
02:13:05.091 --> 02:13:08.000
<v Speaker 3>bottom quark and another heavy electron</v>
<v Speaker 3>call the tail.</v>

2617
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:12.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that there's this weird pattern that</v>

2618
02:13:12.021 --> 02:13:13.610
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't.</v>

2619
02:13:13.730 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 3>Seems like you only needed the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>family to build a universe.</v>

2620
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for some reason there are two copies</v>

2621
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:25.250
<v Speaker 3>now when the heavy ones decay into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighter ones is the point.</v>

2622
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:27.260
<v Speaker 3>So when you make them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not around very long.</v>

2623
02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>And just answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that when they decay,</v>

2624
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:34.020
<v Speaker 3>throw their decay products out into our</v>
<v Speaker 3>detector.</v>

2625
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:39.240
<v Speaker 3>So we take a photograph of the cascade</v>
<v Speaker 3>of particles that comes from these</v>

2626
02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.060
<v Speaker 3>heavier particles decaying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the trick is to patch it all,</v>

2627
02:13:43.061 --> 02:13:45.900
<v Speaker 3>look to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and work out where everything</v>

2628
02:13:45.901 --> 02:13:47.730
<v Speaker 3>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2629
02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Now when they finally find these</v>
<v Speaker 3>unexpected particles,</v>

2630
02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.840
<v Speaker 3>then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the study of them.</v>

2631
02:13:54.841 --> 02:13:57.630
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the and everybody gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and go,</v>

2632
02:13:57.631 --> 02:13:58.800
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is that?</v>

2633
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:00.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

2634
02:14:00.121 --> 02:14:02.100
<v Speaker 3>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we want to know where the Higgs</v>

2635
02:14:02.101 --> 02:14:04.790
<v Speaker 3>particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know what it does is it gives them</v>

2636
02:14:04.791 --> 02:14:08.670
<v Speaker 3>access to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's fundamentally the thing that</v>

2637
02:14:08.671 --> 02:14:12.180
<v Speaker 3>gives mass to all the other things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe at the most fundamental</v>

2638
02:14:12.181 --> 02:14:13.010
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2639
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so electrons for example,</v>

2640
02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:18.160
<v Speaker 3>and the up and down quarks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2641
02:14:18.161 --> 02:14:20.820
<v Speaker 3>a mess from their interaction with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Higgs.</v>

2642
02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:23.940
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another reason we exist.</v>

2643
02:14:23.941 --> 02:14:25.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we go way back.</v>

2644
02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:27.900
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't exist if there wasn't mass</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the universe.</v>

2645
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And the Higgs is ultimately responsible</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that mess.</v>

2646
02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:35.790
<v Speaker 3>And I keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep caveat in it because then you get</v>

2647
02:14:35.791 --> 02:14:38.070
<v Speaker 3>other sorts of masks that are generated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2648
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:43.330
<v Speaker 3>but that the fundamental basic seed is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it where is from is from the Higgs and</v>

2649
02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:48.150
<v Speaker 3>so what we want to know is we want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how that thing behaves and the way</v>

2650
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:51.060
<v Speaker 3>you want to study it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want to make a lot of them so you</v>

2651
02:14:51.061 --> 02:14:55.170
<v Speaker 3>can take a lot of pictures of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>study it a lot and see exactly how it</v>

2652
02:14:55.171 --> 02:14:56.850
<v Speaker 3>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what we're doing.</v>

2653
02:14:57.210 --> 02:14:58.650
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're engaged in at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

2654
02:14:58.651 --> 02:15:03.450
<v Speaker 3>We're making high precision measurements</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way that particle behaves so we</v>

2655
02:15:03.451 --> 02:15:07.770
<v Speaker 3>can understand the laws of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that is the laws of nature.</v>

2656
02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.170
<v Speaker 3>How are those particles behave and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they doing.</v>

2657
02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:16.130
<v Speaker 3>But it is possible that some new form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>some new form of particles,</v>

2658
02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.750
<v Speaker 3>something else could be discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2659
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:24.160
<v Speaker 3>The we know about yet because we know</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost know that there,</v>

2660
02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>there are other particles out there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

2661
02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.110
<v Speaker 3>We almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2662
02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.950
<v Speaker 3>because I think called dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2663
02:15:28.951 --> 02:15:32.580
<v Speaker 3>So we look out into the universe and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that there's a lot of stuff there</v>

2664
02:15:32.581 --> 02:15:34.530
<v Speaker 3>that's interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitation Italy,</v>

2665
02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.300
<v Speaker 3>but he's not interacting strongly with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the matter out of which we are made and</v>

2666
02:15:39.301 --> 02:15:41.100
<v Speaker 3>the stars are made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

2667
02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:44.700
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost certain that that some form</v>

2668
02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:48.450
<v Speaker 3>of particle that that fits beautifully</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we see lots of different</v>

2669
02:15:48.451 --> 02:15:52.920
<v Speaker 3>observations the way galaxies rotate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>interact and even the oldest light in</v>

2670
02:15:52.921 --> 02:15:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the so called cosmic microwave</v>

2671
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:57.960
<v Speaker 3>background radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see the signature of that stuff in</v>

2672
02:15:57.961 --> 02:15:58.920
<v Speaker 3>that light as well.</v>

2673
02:15:59.430 --> 02:16:03.270
<v Speaker 3>So we think that there's some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>particle out there and to be honest,</v>

2674
02:16:03.271 --> 02:16:08.271
<v Speaker 3>we thought we would have detected it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at Lhc we have lots of theories</v>

2675
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:12.360
<v Speaker 3>called supersymmetric theories that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>predictions for all sorts of different</v>

2676
02:16:12.370 --> 02:16:15.780
<v Speaker 3>particles that would interact weekly</v>
<v Speaker 3>with normal matter.</v>

2677
02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 3>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2678
02:16:17.641 --> 02:16:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I think it's broadly seen as a surprise</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we haven't seen them the LAC.</v>

2679
02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.410
<v Speaker 3>So that just may well mean that either</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very,</v>

2680
02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:29.680
<v Speaker 3>they're a bit too massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we need more energy to make them.</v>

2681
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.980
<v Speaker 3>And we just haven't quite got enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2682
02:16:31.981 --> 02:16:34.330
<v Speaker 3>we're not making enough of them often</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to see them,</v>

2683
02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:36.640
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the reasons we're great</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the LHC.</v>

2684
02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:41.320
<v Speaker 3>So we also looked for them by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm directly,</v>

2685
02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 3>so we have experiments and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>

2686
02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:45.920
<v Speaker 3>we bury them in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2687
02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 3>so the cosmic rays from space don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>interfere with them.</v>

2688
02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:53.220
<v Speaker 3>And we're looking for the rare occasions</v>
<v Speaker 3>when these dark matter particles bumpin.</v>

2689
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 3>So the particles of matter in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>detector,</v>

2690
02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:58.480
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea would be this room's full of</v>

2691
02:16:58.481 --> 02:17:01.000
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the galaxy is swimming with that</v>

2692
02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>matter as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but interacts very weakly with this</v>

2693
02:17:05.710 --> 02:17:08.170
<v Speaker 3>matter so it doesn't bump into us very</v>
<v Speaker 3>often.</v>

2694
02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 3>So we're looking for the direct</v>
<v Speaker 3>detection of it and we're looking to</v>

2695
02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:14.950
<v Speaker 3>make those particles lhc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's everywhere,</v>

2696
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:17.640
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't interact with us very</v>
<v Speaker 3>weakly.</v>

2697
02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so interacts with the gravity and the,</v>

2698
02:17:20.310 --> 02:17:20.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2699
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:23.260
<v Speaker 3>the archetype or particle that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

2700
02:17:23.261 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't interact strongly as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>neutrino.</v>

2701
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:28.480
<v Speaker 3>So we do know about neutrinos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've detected those.</v>

2702
02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:33.780
<v Speaker 3>And there there is something like 60</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion per centimeter squared per</v>

2703
02:17:34.271 --> 02:17:38.200
<v Speaker 3>second passing through your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now from the sun,</v>

2704
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.570
<v Speaker 3>so they get made in nuclear reactions in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sun,</v>

2705
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:43.660
<v Speaker 3>but they go straight through your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then straight through the earth,</v>

2706
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:48.400
<v Speaker 3>pretty much occasionally one of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>bumps into something and we can detect</v>

2707
02:17:48.401 --> 02:17:51.760
<v Speaker 3>those cars were so many of them are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through,</v>

2708
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:52.680
<v Speaker 3>but we only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2709
02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one or two a day.</v>

2710
02:17:55.660 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 3>And the ideas that dark matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>encompasses an enormous percentage of</v>

2711
02:18:00.221 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2712
02:18:01.781 --> 02:18:06.781
<v Speaker 3>it's five times as much matter is dark</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter than is normal matter and the</v>

2713
02:18:08.741 --> 02:18:12.940
<v Speaker 3>number is 25 percent of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's roughly speaking,</v>

2714
02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 3>but five percent of the university's</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal matter stars in gas,</v>

2715
02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:20.660
<v Speaker 3>25 percent is dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2716
02:18:20.670 --> 02:18:21.400
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2717
02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:22.210
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no amount.</v>

2718
02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:24.880
<v Speaker 3>About 25 dark matter and about 70 is</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark energy.</v>

2719
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:26.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing,</v>

2720
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.780
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what the hell is that?</v>

2721
02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:32.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know know what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

2722
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:35.980
<v Speaker 3>what we talked about Einstein's theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

2723
02:18:35.981 --> 02:18:39.760
<v Speaker 3>So Einstein's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which works spectacularly well,</v>

2724
02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:43.090
<v Speaker 3>says that if you put stuff into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

2725
02:18:43.091 --> 02:18:46.090
<v Speaker 3>we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he walks and deforms and stretches</v>

2726
02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:50.950
<v Speaker 3>and it very precisely telogy given the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that you put in it,</v>

2727
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:55.870
<v Speaker 3>how much does it stretch and how does it</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretch and the the measurement we have</v>

2728
02:18:55.871 --> 02:18:57.090
<v Speaker 3>is how stretching.</v>

2729
02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So so we we observed the thing we</v>
<v Speaker 3>observe is how the universe is expanding</v>

2730
02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.460
<v Speaker 3>and how the expansion rate is changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how excited and how it's changed</v>

2731
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:09.100
<v Speaker 3>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have very precise measurements of</v>

2732
02:19:09.101 --> 02:19:11.380
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we can use this theory to tell</v>

2733
02:19:11.381 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 3>us what's in it given that we know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's responding to that stuff.</v>

2734
02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:18.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's how we discovered dark</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

2735
02:19:18.730 --> 02:19:22.300
<v Speaker 3>So we noticed that the university is</v>
<v Speaker 3>expansion rate is increasing.</v>

2736
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 3>So university accelerating in its</v>
<v Speaker 3>expansion,</v>

2737
02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly the opposite of what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought and this is in the 19 nineties</v>

2738
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:34.961
<v Speaker 3>that we discovered that so we can work</v>
<v Speaker 3>out what sort of stuff and how much of</v>

2739
02:19:35.151 --> 02:19:37.790
<v Speaker 3>that stuff you need to put in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe to make that happen.</v>

2740
02:19:38.390 --> 02:19:39.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's where we get these numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2741
02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 3>And was there resistance to that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was first proposed?</v>

2742
02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:44.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in it.</v>

2743
02:19:44.931 --> 02:19:47.100
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my friends that Brian Schmidt and</v>

2744
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:49.310
<v Speaker 3>got the Nobel prize for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2745
02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 3>I remember I talked to him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2746
02:19:51.951 --> 02:19:53.660
<v Speaker 3>he was a Postdoc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at the time,</v>

2747
02:19:53.661 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 3>so young researcher and he made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's making measurements of Supernova,</v>

2748
02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>the light from supernova explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so bright that you can see</v>

2749
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:01.790
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:04.130
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of light years away.</v>

2751
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:06.730
<v Speaker 3>And he noticed that if you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>

2752
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:11.720
<v Speaker 3>the light is stretched in the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we look at the stretch of light as it</v>

2753
02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:14.690
<v Speaker 3>travels across the universe and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe is expanding.</v>

2754
02:20:14.691 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>It stretches the lights so it changes</v>
<v Speaker 3>the color.</v>

2755
02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.700
<v Speaker 3>And he noticed that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>discrepancy,</v>

2756
02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:24.230
<v Speaker 3>which we said that the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the expansion rate is speeding up.</v>

2757
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 3>It's been speeding up from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think something like 7 billion years</v>

2758
02:20:28.611 --> 02:20:28.710
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

2759
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:30.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's been speeding up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2760
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:34.160
<v Speaker 3>so he thought that he's done something</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong because it,</v>

2761
02:20:34.470 --> 02:20:35.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2762
02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 3>so he checked it and checked it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>checked it and he couldn't find anything</v>

2763
02:20:38.001 --> 02:20:40.490
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he did what a good scientist does,</v>

2764
02:20:40.491 --> 02:20:43.400
<v Speaker 3>which he published it so that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else could find out what he'd done</v>

2765
02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:45.350
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that he thought it would be</v>

2766
02:20:45.351 --> 02:20:47.990
<v Speaker 3>the end of his career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought I'd be a laughing stock and</v>

2767
02:20:47.991 --> 02:20:49.510
<v Speaker 3>he got the Nobel prize because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2768
02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It is stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2769
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:54.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a great lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Means that if you,</v>

2770
02:20:54.361 --> 02:20:57.920
<v Speaker 3>if you're sure that you can't see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done wrong,</v>

2771
02:20:58.250 --> 02:21:00.410
<v Speaker 3>then you publish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to that thing about</v>

2772
02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:03.230
<v Speaker 3>humility we talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what we ultimately,</v>

2773
02:21:03.231 --> 02:21:07.400
<v Speaker 3>we're not trying to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to find out stuff and so</v>

2774
02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:11.180
<v Speaker 3>they're a good scientists will be really</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy if they set out to be wrong</v>

2775
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:12.920
<v Speaker 3>because they've learned something now.</v>

2776
02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:13.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

2777
02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:16.880
<v Speaker 3>it's good that you take that path</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he got the Nobel prize now when</v>

2778
02:21:16.881 --> 02:21:20.870
<v Speaker 3>he received the Nobel prize in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept started being discussed,</v>

2779
02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:23.810
<v Speaker 3>what was the initial reaction to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2780
02:21:23.811 --> 02:21:27.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because it's allowed in</v>

2781
02:21:27.291 --> 02:21:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Einstein's theory and it was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Einstein's original theory,</v>

2782
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 3>so it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a name,</v>

2783
02:21:32.001 --> 02:21:34.600
<v Speaker 3>it's called the cosmological constant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

2784
02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2785
02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:39.230
<v Speaker 3>it just allowed in the equations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Einstein actually introduced it,</v>

2786
02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>initially to,</v>

2787
02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:47.020
<v Speaker 3>because Einstein's equations strongly</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that the universe is expanding</v>

2788
02:21:47.601 --> 02:21:52.601
<v Speaker 3>or contracting and not just sat there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even before we'd observed anything,</v>

2789
02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Einstein had a theory that suggested</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the university just not static and</v>

2790
02:21:58.060 --> 02:22:00.590
<v Speaker 3>actually really strongly suggest that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a beginning,</v>

2791
02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:01.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2792
02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:06.680
<v Speaker 3>the theory itself on its own suggests</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can see if the university is</v>

2793
02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 3>stretching today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he must've been smaller in the</v>

2794
02:22:08.991 --> 02:22:09.380
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2795
02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything must have been closer</v>

2796
02:22:10.761 --> 02:22:11.810
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that,</v>

2797
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:13.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

2798
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a man magical George Lemaitre,</v>

2799
02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:19.190
<v Speaker 3>who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who works independently of Einstein,</v>

2800
02:22:19.191 --> 02:22:22.730
<v Speaker 3>but the same time in the early 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties before we even knew there were</v>

2801
02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:26.420
<v Speaker 3>other galaxies beyond the Milky Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they notice that the,</v>

2802
02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>the equation suggests the universe might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be stretching.</v>

2803
02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he wrote to Einstein and said,</v>

2804
02:22:31.831 --> 02:22:36.630
<v Speaker 3>your theory suggests there was a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>without a yesterday because he thought</v>

2805
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:39.600
<v Speaker 3>if everything's expanding now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it must've been closer together in</v>

2806
02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:42.720
<v Speaker 3>the past and so there might be a time</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was all together and he was a</v>

2807
02:22:42.721 --> 02:22:46.050
<v Speaker 3>priest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a Belgian priest.</v>

2808
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:49.560
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wrote about this now it's kind</v>

2809
02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:54.360
<v Speaker 3>of mindset a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that he was more predisposed</v>

2810
02:22:54.361 --> 02:22:58.110
<v Speaker 3>to accept what the equations were</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling him because a beginning,</v>

2811
02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:03.120
<v Speaker 3>an origin for priest is really a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing because it tells you the creation</v>

2812
02:23:03.121 --> 02:23:06.690
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an Einstein try to dodge it and put</v>

2813
02:23:06.691 --> 02:23:10.200
<v Speaker 3>this allowed term into his equation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the,</v>

2814
02:23:10.201 --> 02:23:12.050
<v Speaker 3>almost the stretchy tube.</v>

2815
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:13.620
<v Speaker 3>So say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if it's old,</v>

2816
02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:16.890
<v Speaker 3>if it's all kind of contract in or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2817
02:23:16.891 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 3>can I put something in to make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretch a bit to balance it all out so</v>

2818
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:24.660
<v Speaker 3>it can be eternal and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't make it eternal that way,</v>

2819
02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:26.430
<v Speaker 3>but eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he tried it,</v>

2820
02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:29.910
<v Speaker 3>they took it out and cold it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His biggest blunder,</v>

2821
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:34.170
<v Speaker 3>taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it in his biggest funder,</v>

2822
02:23:34.380 --> 02:23:39.380
<v Speaker 3>or at least some people think what he'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>done was missed the prediction of the</v>

2823
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:40.860
<v Speaker 3>big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2824
02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So by trying to fiddle around to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>static universe that stable,</v>

2825
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:48.810
<v Speaker 3>he missed what the equations were</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming.</v>

2826
02:23:48.811 --> 02:23:51.720
<v Speaker 3>His own theory was screaming to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that no,</v>

2827
02:23:51.721 --> 02:23:55.260
<v Speaker 3>the universe expands or contracts and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>missed it.</v>

2828
02:23:55.530 --> 02:23:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's probably what he meant</v>

2829
02:23:57.991 --> 02:24:01.320
<v Speaker 3>by biggest blunder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in any case he took it out and then</v>

2830
02:24:01.321 --> 02:24:04.230
<v Speaker 3>later in the 19 nineties it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notes there,</v>

2831
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's really small.</v>

2832
02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:08.610
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny effect,</v>

2833
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:13.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's still dominating the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and it will,</v>

2834
02:24:13.350 --> 02:24:15.090
<v Speaker 3>it will dominate even more in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

2835
02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:20.450
<v Speaker 3>So we think that we're in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will continue to expand essentially</v>

2836
02:24:20.851 --> 02:24:24.990
<v Speaker 3>doubling in size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fixed timescale in which is about 20</v>

2837
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:27.420
<v Speaker 3>billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So within every 20 billion years into</v>

2838
02:24:27.421 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 3>the future forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless something happens,</v>

2839
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:35.510
<v Speaker 3>the universe will continue to expand and</v>
<v Speaker 3>double in size to you.</v>

2840
02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's the dark energy is driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2841
02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:40.140
<v Speaker 3>but nobody knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

2842
02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:45.580
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the cutting edge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive problems in theoretical physics</v>

2843
02:24:46.350 --> 02:24:50.460
<v Speaker 3>and what is being done to try to get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>better grasp of what it is.</v>

2844
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's theoretical.</v>

2845
02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:54.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're making very precise</v>
<v Speaker 3>observations of it,</v>

2846
02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:57.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it looks like this constant,</v>

2847
02:24:57.510 --> 02:25:00.330
<v Speaker 3>so it looks like it's basically one a</v>
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>

2848
02:25:00.331 --> 02:25:02.760
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Einstein's equations and just really</v>

2849
02:25:02.761 --> 02:25:03.594
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>

2850
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So it looks like it's something that may</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a property of space itself,</v>

2851
02:25:07.841 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it looks like a very simple thing</v>

2852
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:15.570
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't change over time and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>stays there so,</v>

2853
02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:20.660
<v Speaker 3>so it requires theoretical advance as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2854
02:25:20.730 --> 02:25:23.620
<v Speaker 3>And so people are trying very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

2855
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.390
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy when you go from Galileo</v>
<v Speaker 3>to modern theoretical physics that</v>

2856
02:25:28.391 --> 02:25:33.391
<v Speaker 3>they're still in the midst of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what all this stuff is.</v>

2857
02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these,</v>

2858
02:25:36.371 --> 02:25:37.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2859
02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:40.930
<v Speaker 3>these are fundamental and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems and we're talking about the</v>

2860
02:25:40.931 --> 02:25:45.010
<v Speaker 3>origin and evolution of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is and it,</v>

2861
02:25:45.011 --> 02:25:47.170
<v Speaker 3>and tell us a particle physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2862
02:25:47.180 --> 02:25:50.110
<v Speaker 3>the way that these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

2863
02:25:50.111 --> 02:25:51.940
<v Speaker 3>we keep talking about this stuff in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

2864
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:57.150
<v Speaker 3>that's what the lhc studies he studies</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the stuff behaves right now.</v>

2865
02:25:57.640 --> 02:25:59.590
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very theoretical,</v>

2866
02:25:59.591 --> 02:25:59.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2867
02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.000
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to wrap their minds</v>
<v Speaker 3>around what this is and what the</v>

2868
02:26:04.001 --> 02:26:07.900
<v Speaker 3>properties of it or do you envision a</v>
<v Speaker 3>time where you can actually physically</v>

2869
02:26:07.901 --> 02:26:09.580
<v Speaker 3>measure this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have a,</v>

2870
02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:12.670
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real clear understanding of what it is</v>

2871
02:26:12.671 --> 02:26:16.660
<v Speaker 3>and what its properties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dark energy and I don't know.</v>

2872
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2873
02:26:17.681 --> 02:26:19.240
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are theories,</v>

2874
02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:21.820
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which should probably not right,</v>

2875
02:26:21.821 --> 02:26:25.510
<v Speaker 3>but they're not necessarily wrong here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are theories that try to link it</v>

2876
02:26:25.511 --> 02:26:29.190
<v Speaker 3>to the Higgs particle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Higgs particle which we've</v>

2877
02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.060
<v Speaker 3>discovered and can measure has some</v>
<v Speaker 3>properties that we think the dark energy</v>

2878
02:26:34.930 --> 02:26:38.350
<v Speaker 3>would need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll this inflation I mentioned way</v>

2879
02:26:38.351 --> 02:26:41.950
<v Speaker 3>back at the start of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has some of the properties that can</v>

2880
02:26:41.951 --> 02:26:44.290
<v Speaker 3>do that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

2881
02:26:44.291 --> 02:26:47.890
<v Speaker 3>there are faithfully tries to link them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we do have an observation of the</v>

2882
02:26:47.891 --> 02:26:48.350
<v Speaker 3>higgs.</v>

2883
02:26:48.350 --> 02:26:50.980
<v Speaker 3>We can study that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are they linked?</v>

2884
02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2885
02:26:52.570 --> 02:26:57.570
<v Speaker 3>but so it could be that we can study it</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's a very small weak</v>

2886
02:26:58.481 --> 02:27:01.860
<v Speaker 3>effects and it could be web direct</v>
<v Speaker 3>access.</v>

2887
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Food is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just these are big mysteries</v>

2888
02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.940
<v Speaker 3>that there's something really profound</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand about the way that</v>

2889
02:27:09.941 --> 02:27:14.380
<v Speaker 3>stuff in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Higgs actually interacts with space</v>

2890
02:27:14.381 --> 02:27:18.850
<v Speaker 3>and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So very naively the higgs should blow</v>

2891
02:27:18.851 --> 02:27:23.851
<v Speaker 3>the universe apart just very naively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's loads of energy in a very small</v>

2892
02:27:24.581 --> 02:27:27.820
<v Speaker 3>amount of space and huge amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy and the higgs field,</v>

2893
02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:31.270
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't do anything apart from</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving to things.</v>

2894
02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:35.890
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem to me it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly affect space,</v>

2895
02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:40.360
<v Speaker 3>but everything else that you put in</v>
<v Speaker 3>space directly affects it.</v>

2896
02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2897
02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.850
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are kind of issues there that we</v>

2898
02:27:45.851 --> 02:27:47.320
<v Speaker 3>don't and it just says we don't get it.</v>

2899
02:27:47.350 --> 02:27:49.510
<v Speaker 3>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't get it yet.</v>

2900
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:52.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just another one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably late there.</v>

2901
02:27:52.391 --> 02:27:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was to guess,</v>

2902
02:27:53.501 --> 02:27:55.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd say there's some link there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
02:27:55.421 --> 02:28:00.280
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on and solving</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them might solve the other two</v>

2904
02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:05.580
<v Speaker 3>inflation higgs dark energy something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people worldwide would you</v>

2905
02:28:05.921 --> 02:28:10.540
<v Speaker 3>estimate are trying to grasp this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and working on this?</v>

2906
02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:12.670
<v Speaker 3>A good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2907
02:28:12.671 --> 02:28:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably tens if that is tens of</v>

2908
02:28:16.330 --> 02:28:17.710
<v Speaker 3>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you count all the people who work at</v>

2909
02:28:17.711 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 3>cern and the particle physicists and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretical physicists,</v>

2910
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:23.870
<v Speaker 3>it'd be tens of thousands because</v>

2911
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so important to,</v>

2912
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:29.960
<v Speaker 2>for us to get an understanding of what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

2913
02:28:29.961 --> 02:28:34.961
<v Speaker 2>but yet so outside of the grasp of most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people including me,</v>

2914
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:37.640
<v Speaker 2>like I'm listening to you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I'm like,</v>

2915
02:28:37.641 --> 02:28:40.430
<v Speaker 2>thank God there's people like you thank</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2916
02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>thank quirks because people like you out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that are doing this,</v>

2917
02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:48.170
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you're speaking another</v>

2918
02:28:48.171 --> 02:28:50.930
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so strange to me.</v>

2919
02:28:51.070 --> 02:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very new stuff,</v>

2920
02:28:53.290 --> 02:28:53.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2921
02:28:53.781 --> 02:28:57.800
<v Speaker 2>even when I was at school and so when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was at university,</v>

2922
02:28:57.801 --> 02:29:01.760
<v Speaker 2>we hadn't discovered the top quark and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew it was there.</v>

2923
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:06.140
<v Speaker 2>We thought the Higgs might be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had no idea whether it was,</v>

2924
02:29:06.141 --> 02:29:06.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2925
02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:10.670
<v Speaker 2>so we were moving in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're moving quite fast.</v>

2926
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet you're right,</v>

2927
02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:16.040
<v Speaker 2>these are the most fundamental questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what,</v>

2928
02:29:16.041 --> 02:29:20.150
<v Speaker 2>why is there ultimately why is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe the way it is and even possibly</v>

2929
02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:23.840
<v Speaker 2>why is there a universe right where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were away from that yet,</v>

2930
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:28.870
<v Speaker 2>but if we're ever going to answer that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be by doing stuff like this and</v>

2931
02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:34.010
<v Speaker 2>this is all addressed in this live show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing this world live show</v>

2932
02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and certainly the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also the consequences of the not</v>

2933
02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:43.540
<v Speaker 2>the country has had knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cosmology is terrifying that as</v>

2934
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:44.930
<v Speaker 2>we've started with.</v>

2935
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:47.980
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've said it,</v>

2936
02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:52.970
<v Speaker 2>it raises questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes quite vivid questions that we</v>

2937
02:29:52.971 --> 02:29:55.250
<v Speaker 2>all have about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2938
02:29:55.251 --> 02:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing here like this?</v>

2939
02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 2>So I try and I think this goes all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back to me.</v>

2940
02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm really been into Carl Sagan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He always used to try this.</v>

2941
02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:09.320
<v Speaker 2>You try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to link it to things that people</v>

2942
02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 2>think about naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's why people are fascinated by</v>

2943
02:30:12.891 --> 02:30:15.580
<v Speaker 2>this stuff because they do actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

2944
02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:19.490
<v Speaker 2>It might not be with the right names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right words or the right facts even,</v>

2945
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:22.010
<v Speaker 2>but they're thinking about how did I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

2946
02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:25.400
<v Speaker 2>how did I come to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the future?</v>

2947
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Do we have a future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was our past year?</v>

2948
02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:30.620
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are universal questions.</v>

2949
02:30:30.621 --> 02:30:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I think there certainly are and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this with your live show,</v>

2950
02:30:34.731 --> 02:30:38.570
<v Speaker 2>you were saying that you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous visual aspect to it as well.</v>

2951
02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:40.390
<v Speaker 2>We have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2952
02:30:41.050 --> 02:30:44.060
<v Speaker 2>we have the biggest screen we can get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>every venue and it's led.</v>

2953
02:30:44.061 --> 02:30:46.470
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the state of the art modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>led screen,</v>

2954
02:30:46.471 --> 02:30:51.110
<v Speaker 2>so they're like Lego and you can build</v>
<v Speaker 2>them so you fill the venue with it so</v>

2955
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:55.880
<v Speaker 2>you know at Wembley arena than it's 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>meters wide by eight meters high.</v>

2956
02:30:55.881 --> 02:30:58.490
<v Speaker 2>It's enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must have a huge crew carrying all</v>

2957
02:30:58.491 --> 02:31:02.060
<v Speaker 2>this stuff for 16 or 18 people and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a rock and roll show.</v>

2958
02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Some of the venues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it in North America that in Canada</v>

2959
02:31:05.811 --> 02:31:09.770
<v Speaker 2>that there are a bit smaller venues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we just fill it with screen as much</v>

2960
02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:11.300
<v Speaker 2>as we can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the graphics,</v>

2961
02:31:11.301 --> 02:31:15.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the graphics I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have were done by a day neg who did x</v>

2962
02:31:15.501 --> 02:31:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Makena actually an interstellar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I chose,</v>

2963
02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I chose them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rang them up and goes,</v>

2964
02:31:22.621 --> 02:31:24.150
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please will you do this.</v>

2965
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:25.870
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one have you got?</v>

2966
02:31:25.900 --> 02:31:28.230
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's way lower than Chris Nolan.</v>

2967
02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:29.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it.</v>

2968
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:32.310
<v Speaker 2>They were really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just liked the idea of these</v>

2969
02:31:32.311 --> 02:31:34.110
<v Speaker 2>messages and these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

2970
02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:38.190
<v Speaker 2>they use the software that they use for</v>
<v Speaker 2>interstellar to create images of black</v>

2971
02:31:38.191 --> 02:31:43.191
<v Speaker 2>holes and they use general relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They coded it into the so that graphic</v>

2972
02:31:45.041 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can rate trace lights around</v>

2973
02:31:48.031 --> 02:31:51.810
<v Speaker 2>black holes and you can move the camera</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the black hole and it traces the</v>

2974
02:31:51.811 --> 02:31:54.720
<v Speaker 2>way or the light moves around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you remember those amazing,</v>

2975
02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:57.330
<v Speaker 2>the Gargantua,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black hole interstellar,</v>

2976
02:31:57.810 --> 02:31:59.490
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a simulation.</v>

2977
02:31:59.491 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not an artist's impression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a simulation of what Einstein's</v>

2978
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:05.220
<v Speaker 2>theory tells us a black coal will look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

2979
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:09.630
<v Speaker 2>And so I can use that to talk about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when you fall into a black hole.</v>

2980
02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:14.310
<v Speaker 2>What would you see watching someone fall</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and you can explain all that using</v>

2981
02:32:14.311 --> 02:32:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Einstein's theory now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that it's kind of a well known</v>

2982
02:32:18.211 --> 02:32:19.900
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bizarre idea that if,</v>

2983
02:32:20.210 --> 02:32:22.860
<v Speaker 2>if I was to fall into a black hole and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were watching,</v>

2984
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd never seen me fall in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd see time slow down my time,</v>

2985
02:32:28.081 --> 02:32:31.200
<v Speaker 2>slow down as you watched me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the end I just slow down,</v>

2986
02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.250
<v Speaker 2>slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down,</v>

2987
02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:37.290
<v Speaker 2>and then I get frozen on the event</v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon and just fade away as an image</v>

2988
02:32:37.310 --> 02:32:42.310
<v Speaker 2>or reddening image on the event horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So time passes at different rates as you</v>

2989
02:32:42.691 --> 02:32:46.650
<v Speaker 2>move closer to the black hole and</v>
<v Speaker 2>faraway because space and time of</v>

2990
02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:51.480
<v Speaker 2>distorted by the mass of the black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can I talk about all that,</v>

2991
02:32:51.481 --> 02:32:55.860
<v Speaker 2>but I talk about all that with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible image which we had.</v>

2992
02:32:56.400 --> 02:32:58.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so high resolution by the way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2993
02:32:58.441 --> 02:33:02.090
<v Speaker 2>It was higher resolution than they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>used for interstellar cause my screen's</v>

2994
02:33:02.100 --> 02:33:05.700
<v Speaker 2>so big so we need a special machine to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play it.</v>

2995
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:11.000
<v Speaker 2>You can buy the most expensive Mac pro</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world and it will not play this</v>

2996
02:33:11.581 --> 02:33:13.080
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

2997
02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:14.820
<v Speaker 2>From a Geek perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

2998
02:33:14.821 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a special video player</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play the damn thing.</v>

2999
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:21.720
<v Speaker 2>It was just like a series of CPU is all</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached together in some sort of a</v>

3000
02:33:21.721 --> 02:33:23.070
<v Speaker 2>super cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3001
02:33:23.071 --> 02:33:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those is a big sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>visualization graphics.</v>

3002
02:33:25.891 --> 02:33:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Things were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these files,</v>

3003
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

3004
02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Twenty gig video files because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many pixels.</v>

3005
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:33.630
<v Speaker 2>The pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really geeky in it.</v>

3006
02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:36.780
<v Speaker 2>The fix the regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six thousand 400 by 15,</v>

3007
02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:38.940
<v Speaker 2>36,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven screens.</v>

3008
02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3009
02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:45.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're huge files.</v>

3010
02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you coming to Los Angeles with this?</v>
