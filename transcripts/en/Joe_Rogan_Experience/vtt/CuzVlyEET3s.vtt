00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us get there,</v>

3
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:04.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that we know came from a place where when they were really</v>

5
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.901
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

7
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on with the world?</v>

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

9
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.781
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>how old were you?</v>

11
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you were when you had your first,</v>

12
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I think my parents might be fucking crazy thought.</v>

14
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.651
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>

15
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>These people are in charge of telling me what to do.</v>

16
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>This is nonsense.</v>

17
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>You're making you,</v>

18
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you're talking crazy talk here.</v>

19
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>

20
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 2>It happened for me.</v>

21
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

22
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the first time that I took,</v>

23
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.443
<v Speaker 2>LSD.</v>

25
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

26
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 2>and maybe before that,</v>

27
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>but when I took Lsd,</v>

28
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

29
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>when I took LSD for the first time,</v>

30
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I can remember when,</v>

31
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 2>whenever you take Lsd,</v>

32
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.431
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

34
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

36
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>when I took Lsd,</v>

38
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 2>what worries do I have?</v>

39
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm in fucking high school.</v>

40
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.891
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

41
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in there.</v>

42
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:47.684
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to,</v>

43
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 2>there's no demons to come swimming out of my brain and taught me with like all</v>

44
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 2>the myriad of things you get when you're older.</v>

45
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>There's this fucking nothing you would just open.</v>

46
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.881
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

47
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I might be upset cause like a cheerleader that came over to my house,</v>

48
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't figure out how to kiss her.</v>

49
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's like the biggest problem I'm having at the time.</v>

50
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

51
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.561
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

52
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:06.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.180
<v Speaker 2>at that time when I did it for the first time and had that initial experience,</v>

54
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 2>when you go back to your parents who've never taken it,</v>

57
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and if you mentioned it to them that you'd even taken it,</v>

58
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 2>they might want to put you in a drug rehab or they think you're insane or they</v>

59
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>think you're getting down the wrong track.</v>

60
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 2>You're forced into this place of like,</v>

61
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.433
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

62
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.363
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

63
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I w you guys don't even,</v>

64
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know you,</v>

65
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand this,</v>

66
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 2>this a new way of experiencing life,</v>

67
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

69
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of people who spend their whole lives never knowing</v>

70
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 2>that you don't have to take psychedelics to get to that place.</v>

71
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 2>There's other ways to get to that place.</v>

72
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

73
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a very strange thing.</v>

74
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>And those people who never get to that place,</v>

75
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones who are,</v>

76
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are,</v>

77
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.931
<v Speaker 2>are in control.</v>

78
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

79
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>So your life took a inexorable change when you did acid that was like the point</v>

80
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>where you look back and you said,</v>

81
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>this is the point where I went off into this direction.</v>

82
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

83
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>well I know I'd say that the,</v>

84
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

85
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.531
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

86
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that taking acid started with a series of like books.</v>

87
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It started with contact with like,</v>

88
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 2>the whole weirdness.</v>

90
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 2>My whole weird weirdness started with,</v>

91
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>or as I recall,</v>

92
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.681
<v Speaker 2>it started with me coming upon this book that my mom had called Raja Yoga by</v>

93
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Yogi mature Rocka,</v>

94
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>who by the way,</v>

95
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it was never a Yogi was just some English mistake.</v>

96
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

97
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Mind about being a Yogi.</v>

98
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 2>But it's a fascinating story.</v>

99
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>But the book,</v>

100
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

101
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time I'd ever read the idea.</v>

103
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

104
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 2>you there that you are an observer observing yourself,</v>

105
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

106
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you aren't necessarily the you,</v>

107
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 2>that you think the you,</v>

108
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 2>that can be observed is not you.</v>

109
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>You're the observer state,</v>

110
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 2>the mindfulness,</v>

111
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 2>the watch or that's when I,</v>

112
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>that's the first time I'd come upon the idea of what that's called,</v>

113
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 2>the amen.</v>

114
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>The thing that observes yourself,</v>

115
00:02:59.471 --> 00:02:59.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

117
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:00.761
<v Speaker 2>someone will say,</v>

119
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm really mad right now.</v>

120
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 2>The moment you say I'm mad,</v>

121
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you're creating a distinction.</v>

122
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

123
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>between the thing that's observing that you're mad.</v>

124
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's mad.</v>

125
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So that observer,</v>

126
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 2>that watcher,</v>

127
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that,</v>

128
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 2>that mindfulness is what,</v>

129
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:16.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>throughout my whole life I try to,</v>

131
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 2>go into that place of observing myself rather than being the thing.</v>

133
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's a game that you can play in.</v>

134
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>It really is quite helpful with a variety of,</v>

135
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:29.231
<v Speaker 2>of problems,</v>

136
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 2>especially if you get really angry.</v>

137
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 2>If you get really angry and you can stop yourself and just watch and there's</v>

138
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.421
<v Speaker 2>tools you can use.</v>

139
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:37.811
<v Speaker 2>In that book.</v>

140
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember it said as you walk around,</v>

141
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 2>start thinking he is walking.</v>

142
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 2>That was like one of the tools,</v>

143
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 2>like it's in a book and you're a character in a book.</v>

144
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So when you're going around,</v>

145
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

146
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>right now he's doing a podcast right now.</v>

148
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>He's talking.</v>

149
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

150
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>

151
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 2>these are activities designed to create this,</v>

152
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.730
<v Speaker 2>like the watcher,</v>

153
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 2>the state of presence of watching.</v>

154
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 2>So that started it.</v>

185
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>And then the narrator says,</v>

186
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Lsd can make you experience hallucinations,</v>

222
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the best thing that can happen to you in general.</v>

223
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause generally the track you're on has been set for you by people who never got</v>

224
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 2>off their track.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:05:55.781 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you end up the child of someone decided to have you in their twenties 2122</v>

228
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to know a lot of stuff.</v>

229
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to understand the universe that much unless they were like</v>

230
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>came from a really good family of like artists are intelligent people.</v>

231
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Chances are they're scared,</v>

232
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.871
<v Speaker 2>hungry,</v>

233
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>desperate,</v>

234
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

235
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.580
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be in the relationship anymore.</v>

236
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to be monogamous anymore.</v>

237
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 2>The idea of non monogamy to them might just seem insane.</v>

238
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.111
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

239
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>like who the fuck knows?</v>

241
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 2>But you're born into that planet.</v>

242
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

243
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the atmosphere you're born into.</v>

244
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're breathing when you're first born.</v>

245
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And that can set you on a weird path.</v>

246
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very sad path that you can get on.</v>

247
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully if you're lucky,</v>

248
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>you'll come across somebody,</v>

249
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 2>you knocks you off that fucking path.</v>

250

00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:47.101
<v Speaker 2>the sheet.</v>

295
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:47.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

296
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.001
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

297
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

298
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.351
<v Speaker 2>purple,</v>

299
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:50.011
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

300
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.720
<v Speaker 2>White Blotter of lips.</v>

301
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:52.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

302
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a million different names for the different types of acid,</v>

303
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

304
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 2>so this is just white.</v>

305
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.391
<v Speaker 2>You who knows what it was,</v>

306
00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was really good and I can remember I took it</v>

307
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>and you have to,</v>

308
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:03.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

309
00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:06.450
<v Speaker 2>it takes 30 to 45 minutes sometimes longer for it to kick in.</v>

310
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I still remember I was sitting in my friend's trailer in a trailer park in North</v>

311
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Carolina sitting in an empty back,</v>

312
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.790
<v Speaker 2>like when it like an empty Jacuzzi tub that was in this trailer.</v>

313
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting there and they're watching star wars and I'm sitting in this</v>

314
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 2>bathtub and all of a sudden the greatest,</v>

315
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the greatest feeling just started going through my legs and up into my</v>

316
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:30.090
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

317
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And it was a fucking sword fight.</v>

318
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.701
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

319
00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 2>a light saber fight.</v>

320
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Bam,</v>

321
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

322
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.791
<v Speaker 2>When I'm listening to that.</v>

323
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 2>But all of a sudden now,</v>

324
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the sounds echoey,</v>

325
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 2>like someone's turned an echo up on it.</v>

326
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:40.380
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

327
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

328
00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:40.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

329
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.980
<v Speaker 2>parents kind of bouncing around.</v>

331
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful and I feel so fucking good.</v>

332
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Started laughing.</v>

333
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:49.290
<v Speaker 2>It seems so funny.</v>

334
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Then I went outside and lay in the grass and staring at the sky.</v>

335
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Everything's beautiful.</v>

336
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 2>You put your hand in front of your face and it's just this rainbow of hands</v>

337
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>drifting in front of your face.</v>

338
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Everything's breathing.</v>

339
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 2>They're my friends come running out because they knew this is the first time I</v>

340
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 2>was tripping and they all start jumping over me.</v>

341
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 2>They're like jumping over me is,</v>

342
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm low and they're laughing and we're all fucking laughing and it's just</v>

343
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

344
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Then I remember they pulled their cock out.</v>

345
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 2>That's when they pulled that too.</v>

346
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 2>We all started fucking,</v>

347
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.230
<v Speaker 2>we fucked and fucked and then a dog came by and we grabbed the dog and started</v>

348
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>fucking the dog.</v>

349
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.793
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

350
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

351
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It was beautiful to the spirit of acid.</v>

352
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:32.960
<v Speaker 2>It's very now.</v>

353
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

354
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 2>there was no fucking happening.</v>

355
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of like laughing.</v>

356
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.231
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

357
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:42.231
<v Speaker 2>I remember going into my friend's shitty high school car and like sitting in</v>

358
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>like pulling the seat back and looking at the ceiling and I'm looking at the</v>

359
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>ceiling and it's fucking hieroglyphics or some kind of like ancient writing.</v>

360
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

361
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think I knew what Sanskrit was at the time,</v>

362
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>but I probably be like,</v>

363
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:54.961
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

364
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing Stan script some kind of runes are glyphs all over my friend's car</v>

365
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 2>that she's kind of breathing and warping and it's just beautiful.</v>

366
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

367
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.181
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

368
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 2>that was the first time.</v>

369
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:07.570
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

370
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>and once you've had that experience,</v>

371
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 2>how do you go back to a world,</v>

372
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 2>a normal kind of world?</v>

373
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.401
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

374
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

375
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

376
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.390
<v Speaker 2>It's cursed.</v>

377
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.543
<v Speaker 2>Swale</v>

378
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.473
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

379
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>they call him a futurist and he's responsible for many,</v>

380
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:22.651
<v Speaker 1>many patents.</v>

381
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.341
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant,</v>

382
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.174
<v Speaker 1>brilliant man.</v>

383
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

384
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>he is a huge proponent of the idea of the technological singularity.</v>

385
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind that is that one day artificial intelligence is going to</v>

386
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>literally and virtually come alive and we're going to merge with it somehow.</v>

387
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>We are either going to be downloaded into computers or consciousness is going to</v>

388
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 1>be replicated and indistinguishable from our current consciousness and that will</v>

389
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>be downloaded into computers.</v>

390
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And though our biological body will die,</v>

391
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>are our electronic signal.</v>

392
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>That is our consciousness that has been recreated.</v>

393
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

394
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>like you copy a Microsoft word file.</v>

396
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You will copy your mind,</v>

398
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 1>you will copy your consciousness,</v>

399
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>your soul.</v>

400
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You will copy something and you will put it into this whatever the fuck it is</v>

403
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>that holds all this stuff.</v>

404
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.680
<v Speaker 1>But what we're saying is that life is almost completely connected to technology</v>

405
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:18.691
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very,</v>

406
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.840
<v Speaker 1>very short time that this has happened 200 years ago.</v>

407
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>There were no cars,</v>

408
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>so in those 200 years we have been connected to cars who was,</v>

410
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:27.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

411
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>a really fascinating video that someone sent me that I put up on Twitter.</v>

412
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted it the other day.</v>

413
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 1>You can find it if you just scour through my Twitter,</v>

414
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's a time lapse video of,</v>

415
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>of cars moving back and forth on freeways and how it looks like blood and the</v>

417
00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

418
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.390
<v Speaker 1>How it looks like the pulsating of blood coming back and forth.</v>

420
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

421
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's clearly is the breath of breathing in and breathing out,</v>

422
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the heartbeats in and out the cars leave the house and come back to that house.</v>

424
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:01.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

425
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

426
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It really is like,</v>

427
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a type of life form.</v>

428
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

429
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>it happens so slowly.</v>

430
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 1>All this traffic sucks.</v>

431
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>My Dick,</v>

432
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:09.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

433
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>on the fucking,</v>

434
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>my car's dying shit and all these things that you,</v>

435
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>you micro manage that,</v>

436
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that scenario.</v>

437
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't see it as this pulsating thing of,</v>

438
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>of cars coming in and cars going out.</v>

439
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And how many of them go in the same God damn door</v>

440
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.090
<v Speaker 2>every day?</v>

441
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.661
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

442
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:24.901
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

443
00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And this is where the,</v>

444
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think about this all the time because the way for,</v>

445
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.940
<v Speaker 2>for things to work,</v>

446
00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:31.260
<v Speaker 2>the way they're working right now,</v>

447
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>which is for there to be capitalism in there to be super rich people and super</v>

448
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:39.780
<v Speaker 2>poor people in war and all the things that you know,</v>

449
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.240
<v Speaker 2>or rather distasteful or seem to be,</v>

450
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

451
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

452
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.720
<v Speaker 2>seem to be a destructive for that,</v>

453
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:46.260
<v Speaker 2>to exist.</v>

454
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Each of those little nodes of consciousness that represent that bloodstream have</v>

455
00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:54.600
<v Speaker 2>to think they're individuals and have to think they're more important than all</v>

456
00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:55.434
<v Speaker 2>the other ones.</v>

457
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.410
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a bunch of blood cells all thinking,</v>

458
00:12:58.411 --> 00:12:58.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

459
00:12:58.561 --> 00:12:59.251
<v Speaker 2>I got to get to work.</v>

460
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:01.110
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's wrong with this asshole in front of me?</v>

461
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.080
<v Speaker 2>And not realizing they're all part of this one super organism.</v>

462
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 2>And if somehow everyone's consciousness shifted from the idea of like,</v>

463
00:13:09.661 --> 00:13:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get to work to whatever the next thing would be,</v>

464
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:18.000
<v Speaker 2>which is I'm connected to this super mind that is the planet,</v>

465
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:18.870
<v Speaker 2>which I think is going to,</v>

466
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.220
<v Speaker 2>that's what the singularity will be.</v>

467
00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:21.720
<v Speaker 2>It will be some technologically,</v>

468
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

469
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.431
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:28.431
<v Speaker 2>applied empathy that allows everyone to connect their consciousness to mother</v>

471
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.491
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

472
00:13:29.491 --> 00:13:29.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

473
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:34.380
<v Speaker 2>That moment capitalism kind of ceases as we know it and capitalism of course,</v>

474
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:34.950
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

475
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>it's a symptom of something deeper.</v>

476
00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:37.470
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

477
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 2>that model,</v>

478
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 2>the model that's running everything is no longer possible.</v>

479
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.160
<v Speaker 1>And that model encourages a competition model,</v>

480
00:13:46.161 --> 00:13:51.161
<v Speaker 1>encourages people to push and strive and push beyond their comfort in order to,</v>

481
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:13:52.371 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 1>to create more action and create more money to create more,</v>

483
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.780
<v Speaker 1>more building,</v>

484
00:13:56.781 --> 00:13:58.130
<v Speaker 1>more construction,</v>

485
00:13:58.131 --> 00:13:58.760
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

486
00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.591
<v Speaker 1>more things,</v>

487
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:00.380
<v Speaker 1>more wars,</v>

488
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.191
<v Speaker 1>more prisons,</v>

489
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:02.024
<v Speaker 1>more la,</v>

490
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.470
<v Speaker 1>buying more things,</v>

491
00:14:03.471 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 1>more diseases.</v>

492
00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:05.790
<v Speaker 1>So we can have more realism.</v>

493
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

494
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.881
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>

495
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:08.930
<v Speaker 1>It all accelerates.</v>

496
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 1>They invented diseases.</v>

497
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.481
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

498
00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing man.</v>

499
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:13.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

500
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:13.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

501
00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:14.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.350
<v Speaker 1>the idea that everything moves in the same direction is that the single celled</v>

503
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:19.184
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

504
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.180
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

506
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:20.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

507
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.340
<v Speaker 1>or even how about we look at blood,</v>

508
00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:22.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:24.080
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about it looking like a,</v>

510
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.120
<v Speaker 1>like blood moving through arteries,</v>

511
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:26.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>blood is a single cell,</v>

513
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.450
<v Speaker 1>single cells of blood move as in the same as this huge animal that has a,</v>

515
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.220
<v Speaker 1>billions of cells and not just that,</v>

517
00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:41.570
<v Speaker 1>but is also a host for all sorts of bacteria and stuff that live inside of our</v>

518
00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:42.404
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

519
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.580
<v Speaker 1>But we have to,</v>

520
00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:47.000
<v Speaker 1>in order to keep it going in the same direction as those cells,</v>

521
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:52.150
<v Speaker 1>we have to have all these different little tools that we use sort of justify</v>

522
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

523
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>all these different little tools like the love of having your baby,</v>

524
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 1>the love of Orgasms,</v>

525
00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 1>the love of going on stage or of creating something,</v>

527
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 1>and you think about the one thing that's the most satisfying,</v>

529
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 1>outside of childbirth and in having your own children is creating,</v>

531
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

532
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.791
<v Speaker 1>people who don't create things I think as a whole are way less happy than people</v>

533
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:17.540
<v Speaker 1>who do create things.</v>

534
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And I know dudes that make pool cues.</v>

535
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I know dudes that make belts,</v>

536
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>they make custom wallets and there's a something that they get when they like,</v>

537
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:25.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I bought a wallet from this dude and you,</v>

539
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you buy a wallet from him and he sells you the wallet and he made it for you and</v>

540
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

541
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a smile that he has,</v>

542
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 1>like he created something,</v>

543
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:37.590
<v Speaker 1>he created a piece of artwork and someone else is appreciating a,</v>

544
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:38.031
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

545
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I love how you did this is wow,</v>

546
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 1>this is awesome work.</v>

547
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>It's so clean and well done.</v>

548
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:42.471
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

549
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:42.881
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

550
00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I like his effort and his,</v>

551
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 1>his creativity have gone into an actual object.</v>

552
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And to us that's very,</v>

553
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:50.181
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

554
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>very satisfying.</v>

555
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the comedy satisfaction that you get for performing.</v>

556
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all we,</v>

557
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:56.510
<v Speaker 1>you and I understand.</v>

558
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:56.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

559
00:15:56.641 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it.</v>

560
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's in music,</v>

561
00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:59.590
<v Speaker 1>it's probably just the same thing.</v>

562
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You create a song and then people love that song creating something.</v>

563
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Then what are you doing when you're creating something while you're doing the</v>

564
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>same fucking thing.</v>

565
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

566
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing the machine,</v>

567
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing it in your way and your way is making people happy and,</v>

568
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 1>and giving people some positive energy by your DVD.</v>

569
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 1>And there's an industry behind that and they come see what the clubs and this</v>

570
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>cause industry behind that.</v>

571
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Even behind putting gas in their cars and you know,</v>

572
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.041
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

573
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:25.281
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

574
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>

575
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how many different pieces are in place.</v>

576
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.191
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

577
00:16:29.191 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>if you take back,</v>

578
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

579
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>zoom in on the idea of what is creation and creation is taking something from</v>

581
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>the nothingness and bringing it into the something that's,</v>

582
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and so you sort of become the doorway for sending that come from the nothingness</v>

583
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.450
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

584
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.161
<v Speaker 1>something I said,</v>

585
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 1>when you're creating,</v>

586
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you're actually experiencing a as flow through from the infinite into the finite</v>

587
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and that I think that is the feeling that we love so much is that sense of</v>

588
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>feeling that that thing when you're working on jokes and all of a sudden it goes</v>

589
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>from being a drudge Tavis sudden it's like,</v>

590
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:00.764
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

591
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>

593
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.870
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you get sucked into this weird vacuum and you,</v>

594
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you've written for like two hours and it feels like a second.</v>

595
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

596
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 1>that that sense of being pulled into a momentary current or something's coming</v>

597
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:16.340
<v Speaker 1>out of you that's clearly not necessarily you.</v>

598
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.550
<v Speaker 1>That to me is like one of the ultimate.</v>

599
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:19.911
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

600
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:20.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate feeling.</v>

601
00:17:20.971 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 1>And I have the,</v>

602
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:27.401
<v Speaker 1>I think if you go by this idea of this attractor that Mckenna talks about her,</v>

604
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:32.090
<v Speaker 1>this thing that exists and hyper hyperspace that it's what it wants to come</v>

605
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:32.361
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

606
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I send it this universe that wants to express itself through us.</v>

607
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

608
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the compulsion that you're talking about.</v>

609
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an alternative viewpoint obviously.</v>

610
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

611
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>there's the cynical way of looking at it like,</v>

612
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:46.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

613
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:46.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

614
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

615
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:47.271
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

616
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural inclination that people have.</v>

617
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Monkeys are curious.</v>

618
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 1>This is what we do.</v>

619
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 1>We think about things.</v>

620
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.480
<v Speaker 1>And every joke that you have is just,</v>

621
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 1>is a cumulation of your life experiences and you're figuring out a little bit,</v>

622
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:00.654
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

623
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You're not tapping into the universal consciousness will be ranked back.</v>

624
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Pailin is on the line and we're going to have a nice little sit down with</v>

625
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>a future president of the United States.</v>

626
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's hope he doesn't fuck anybody,</v>

627
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 1>that he's not married to buy imaginary rituals.</v>

628
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.761
<v Speaker 1>The thing about it,</v>

629
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

630
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>The cynical point of view about the idea of creativity.</v>

631
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that point of view too.</v>

632
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to address it.</v>

633
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:30.741
<v Speaker 1>You can't always go hippie and one of the things I bet I bounced back and forth.</v>

634
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is either,</v>

635
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:32.514
<v Speaker 1>but it is a little,</v>

636
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I bounced back and forth with the idea of the imagination being a,</v>

637
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>almost like when you,</v>

638
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.470
<v Speaker 1>when you have imagination,</v>

639
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the imagination is the real force behind the,</v>

640
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 1>the evolution.</v>

641
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.860
<v Speaker 1>What imagination truly is is we think of as like,</v>

642
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.221
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

643
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I can see things.</v>

644
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I go and work around problems.</v>

645
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:53.724
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea.</v>

646
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 1>But when you imagine an idea,</v>

647
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>when you imagine a product,</v>

648
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you imagine how to design an engine for a car and you're the for,</v>

649
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

650
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 1>your Henry Ford or whoever the fuck made the first engine.</v>

651
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.041
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>

652
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:10.041
<v Speaker 1>your imagination has this idea for this thing and then you build it and design</v>

653
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:11.610
<v Speaker 1>it and boom,</v>

654
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.473
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

655
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.850
<v Speaker 1>That thought what there,</v>

656
00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 1>there was no thought of that before it existed.</v>

657
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not that people were running around thinking of the car and I know it's</v>

658
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 1>going to look like there was no thought of it.</v>

659
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You created this or it came to you.</v>

660
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>There was something from nothing,</v>

661
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.403
<v Speaker 1>something from,</v>

662
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 1>from what is that from the ether.</v>

663
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Something from these.</v>

664
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just these synapses firing in your mind,</v>

665
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 1>where is,</v>

666
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>what is the signal,</v>

667
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>what is the root of this signal to be so you know,</v>

668
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 1>mathematical about it and say,</v>

669
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.201
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

670
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>it's just human ingenuity and that's what it is.</v>

671
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 1>It's good old sticktuitiveness and your roll up your sleeves and yet figure out</v>

672
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>this world want that.</v>

673
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford created a great thing and you know,</v>

674
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>whilst dinner and Tosh,</v>

675
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I understand he was a great fella.</v>

676
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] neurons sweating.</v>

677
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

679
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know it's,</v>

680
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.280
<v Speaker 1>it is possible that the imagination is something that is information that is out</v>

681
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:04.801
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

682
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:05.231
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

683
00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the acacia records,</v>

684
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.050
<v Speaker 1>the idea of uh,</v>

685
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 1>that there's shit out there.</v>

687
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And then what we are is little antennas and that our,</v>

688
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:16.190
<v Speaker 1>when we tune into something,</v>

689
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 1>if we pick up this,</v>

690
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 1>this signal for the engine and someone picks it up,</v>

691
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

692
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Once that piece is in place,</v>

693
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.551
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

694
00:20:23.551 --> 00:20:25.450
<v Speaker 1>and then it flowers and blossoms like,</v>

695
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 1>like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking,</v>

696
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.473
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

697
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>a sunflower.</v>

698
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:29.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

699
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it all bursts out,</v>

700
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>exponentially in certain directions.</v>

702
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And then that starts creating more inventions with all,</v>

703
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>which also burst out.</v>

704
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.280
<v Speaker 1>But all of them emanate in the imagination initially.</v>

705
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.740
<v Speaker 1>All of them have to be thought up auto.</v>

706
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:48.741
<v Speaker 1>All of them have to be created by the human mind or what the human mind can tune</v>

707
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

708
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>There's no way into this universe as a human,</v>

709
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but through a pussy.</v>

710
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way.</v>

711
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Now there is no way for an idea to come into this universe except through a</v>

712
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:03.551
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

713
00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no way for an invention except it to come through our mind.</v>

714
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Our minds are the,</v>

715
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.300
<v Speaker 1>our minds are sort of the creative orifices through which all innovation,</v>

716
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 1>every invention,</v>

717
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>every idea comes.</v>

718
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It's through the human mind.</v>

719
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

720
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.410
<v Speaker 1>if you want to think that some day you just wake up and you get in the shower</v>

721
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and you get lucky enough for your neurons to fire a certain way where you figure</v>

722
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 1>out how to reduce the cost of making solar power panels and solve the uh,</v>

723
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:31.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

724
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the energy problem on the planet.</v>

725
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 1>If you want to think that that's an accident,</v>

726
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:35.140
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

727
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.801
<v Speaker 1>If it helps you.</v>

728
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it helps a lot of people to think that the universe springs from</v>

729
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 1>some kind of lightening pole adding plasma or the earth does or humor,</v>

730
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 1>biological life on the earth.</v>

731
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And some people like to think that their neurons get lucky in fire cause they</v>

732
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 1>squeeze their brow together in the right way and popped out an idea.</v>

733
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.660
<v Speaker 1>But I think you'll find that most of the great creators,</v>

734
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.110
<v Speaker 1>they don't think that you know when you write,</v>

735
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but is that because the best way to create is to not think about yourself?</v>

736
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.720
<v Speaker 1>The best way to create is like when you start thinking about yourself,</v>

737
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 1>the ego starts tripping over his own dick and you start thinking about like how</v>

738
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.264
<v Speaker 1>cool you are.</v>

739
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.540
<v Speaker 1>That's like when you see a guy on stage and the guy like obviously thinks she's</v>

740
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

741
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.380
<v Speaker 1>The worst it's the worst is the feeling is a feeling of gross.</v>

742
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Nist is a disconnect and that disconnect also disconnects him from creativity.</v>

743
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you see a guy on stage and he's just in the moment,</v>

744
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:25.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

745
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

746
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 1>He's just tuned into it.</v>

747
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 1>So compelling and so interesting.</v>

748
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.290
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

749
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's a trick,</v>

750
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.963
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

751
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe this idea that you know that we are tuning into the infinite and it</v>

752
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.420
<v Speaker 1>is maybe not,</v>

753
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe it just requires a certain state of mind to be creative.</v>

754
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And that state of mine is to avoid the ego.</v>

755
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Like the car.</v>

756
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't just invent the car,</v>

757
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 1>you invent the wheel first.</v>

758
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's because somebody sat there like,</v>

759
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:52.751
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

760
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:56.140
<v Speaker 1>I need to take stone or take heavy thing over here.</v>

761
00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

762
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

763
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I understand the intent of the movie.</v>

764
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also necessity.</v>

765
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Inventions come with necessity certainly is,</v>

766
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

767
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Antelopes on event and shit.</v>

768
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 1>They keep getting jacked by Jaguars left and right.</v>

769
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 1>They're stupid fucks.</v>

770
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 1>They never figure it out every year.</v>

771
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.370
<v Speaker 1>They never invented annual mobe car.</v>

772
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Whether you can just give the finger to the Jaguar,</v>

773
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>beeped the Horn and run over the Jaguar babies.</v>

774
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:17.734
<v Speaker 1>They seen the road.</v>

775
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it.</v>

776
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 1>We can and the one of the reasons why we can is because we're conscious because</v>

777
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:24.370
<v Speaker 1>we can think and,</v>

778
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but what is thinking?</v>

779
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>The real question is what are,</v>

780
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 1>what are all these things firing together,</v>

781
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>solving problems.</v>

782
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 1>What is all that really because some people can't solve shit.</v>

783
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:35.531
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

784
00:23:35.531 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear that there's a,</v>

785
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.160
<v Speaker 1>there's different types of people.</v>

786
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are super solvers and there's people that can barely solve</v>

787
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>taking a shit and wiping their ass correctly.</v>

788
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>There's people that can barely show up for work every day.</v>

789
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Everything they do is a fucking mass and they make more people that are just</v>

790
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:53.661
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

791
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Well if you think that there's an order to the whole thing,</v>

792
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 1>what are those fucks here for?</v>

793
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

794
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>are they here just until robots can become invented to do menial tasks?</v>

795
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

796
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

797
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

798
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.651
<v Speaker 2>What you do,</v>

799
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>this is what you do.</v>

800
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Especially you don't,</v>

801
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you think of an IC eat and when things get bad,</v>

802
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.900
<v Speaker 2>for sure they think of like the greatest idea ever.</v>

803
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:11.721
<v Speaker 2>And your brains though,</v>

804
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 2>didn't he get mad cow disease where ions will fuck you up.</v>

805
00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:16.371
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

806
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 2>if you cannibalize you candidate every the brain,</v>

807
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.850
<v Speaker 2>the brain,</v>

808
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.130
<v Speaker 2>just the legs,</v>

809
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.900
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

810
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 2>nature's balls and asshole rates are goes bitch,</v>

811
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you got a problem,</v>

812
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 2>people brains you fucking crazy.</v>

813
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Pella chips are delicious.</v>

814
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.861
<v Speaker 2>If you look at,</v>

815
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

816
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.143
<v Speaker 2>so the idea,</v>

817
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.460
<v Speaker 2>just to get back to this idea of like where do thoughts come from?</v>

818
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Well if you,</v>

819
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.010
<v Speaker 2>if you take things out of the temporal perspective and look at things as some</v>

820
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 2>unified whole,</v>

821
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 2>and by temporal you mean present and future.</v>

822
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

823
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at the whole thing is like from the perspective,</v>

824
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>if we could jump out of time and we could look at whatever this event was,</v>

825
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the big bang for now and the series of reactions that happened</v>

826
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 2>directly after the Big Bang and those first few seconds that the people at the</v>

827
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 2>particle accelerators want to understand.</v>

828
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And then you follow that all the way to the condensation of gas,</v>

829
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I guess that made matter.</v>

830
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 2>An event in the galaxies and the Gat.</v>

831
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And then you follow all the way that to the first,</v>

832
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

834
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 2>mix chemical soup that whatever that was.</v>

835
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And then the DNA starts forming out of that.</v>

836
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:24.830
<v Speaker 2>And then that DNA somehow gets encapsulated in a membrane and we have cells in</v>

837
00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the cells gain symbiotic relationships with other sounds and become</v>

838
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>multicellular organisms,</v>

839
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 2>which have symbiotic relationships.</v>

840
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.570
<v Speaker 2>And eventually you end up with us.</v>

841
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.780
<v Speaker 2>We still are at basically a DNA trail going all the way back to before DNA to</v>

842
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:38.811
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

843
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 2>all the way back to this explosion of light.</v>

844
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And so a thought is an idea of emerging from infinity,</v>

845
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 2>from the ultimate explosion.</v>

846
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.560
<v Speaker 2>The trillions of years ago and to the present moment.</v>

847
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:51.951
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

848
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 2>if that ain't come in from nowhere,</v>

849
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

850
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.191
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

851
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:55.491
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

852
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:56.870
<v Speaker 2>it's my neurons that did it.</v>

853
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:56.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

854
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 2>your neurons did it right now,</v>

855
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 2>but you're a chain of super reactions that led to this moment in time when you</v>

856
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 2>invented the thing you invented,</v>

857
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:05.480
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

858
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

859
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:07.040
<v Speaker 2>you're not just your neurons,</v>

860
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:12.041
<v Speaker 2>you're connected to that an entire ecosystem and you're connected to a infinite</v>

861
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:13.184
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

862
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

863
00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:14.270
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

864
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess when you start looking at things,</v>

865
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

866
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:17.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

867
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.840
<v Speaker 2>there's your 60 year lifespan,</v>

868
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I suppose things can start looking pretty grim and Penn and teller nourish.</v>

869
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 2>But if you really just step out of time and really look at what's going down,</v>

870
00:26:26.121 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

871
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy,</v>

872
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:28.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

873
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.140
<v Speaker 2>We got blasted out of some infinite passed and we're like yapping about it right</v>

874
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

875
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:33.760
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

876
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.111
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

877
00:26:34.111 --> 00:26:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it just keeps going over and over and over and over and over and over again.</v>

878
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you my new theory of reincarnation?</v>

879
00:26:39.061 --> 00:26:39.894
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

880
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's really intense because I thought at this and it freaked me out.</v>

881
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty horrible.</v>

882
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that common idea of reincarnation.</v>

883
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 2>If you subscribe to the theory is that you die and you're born again.</v>

884
00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You go through your childhood,</v>

885
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 2>did you grow up and then you die.</v>

886
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you get born as a cat,</v>

887
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe a butterfly,</v>

888
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

889
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.913
<v Speaker 2>Maybe an Amoeba.</v>

890
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was thinking.</v>

891
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had a dream once and in this dream I was a kid,</v>

892
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 2>a little girl,</v>

893
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.460
<v Speaker 2>and my mom was rubbing my head and I knew I was dying,</v>

894
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know what that meant except I knew it was bad and I could kind of</v>

895
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 2>feel myself fading out.</v>

896
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 2>There was this like white sort of thing happening and then I woke up out of the</v>

897
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:21.361
<v Speaker 2>dream like,</v>

898
00:27:21.361 --> 00:27:21.841
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

899
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.860
<v Speaker 2>what is shitty dream?</v>

900
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 2>So I was thinking like,</v>

901
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

902
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 2>what if that's what reincarnation is.</v>

903
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 2>What if when you die,</v>

904
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're driving home one night,</v>

905
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 2>you've had too many part lollipops.</v>

906
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 2>You're listening to coast to coast.</v>

907
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Someone says something shocking that makes you look away from the road.</v>

908
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 2>You swerve off,</v>

909
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you slam into a tree,</v>

910
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.783
<v Speaker 2>you wake up,</v>

911
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you're here back in your house like,</v>

912
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:44.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>

913
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 2>what is shitty dream,</v>

914
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 2>but you've really died.</v>

915
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:49.200
<v Speaker 2>You just re-incarnated again into an ultimate reality,</v>

916
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 2>an alternate reality,</v>

917
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:52.110
<v Speaker 2>so you literally can't die.</v>

918
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no break.</v>

919
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 2>This just goes on forever and ever and ever and ever.</v>

920
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 2>No break,</v>

921
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 2>no stopping,</v>

922
00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>no new age.</v>

923
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Going into the light and seeing your parents and your family and taking a,</v>

924
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 2>going into some new age,</v>

925
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 2>a cosmic spa where you get to shake off all your shitty Karma.</v>

926
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.530
<v Speaker 2>It never stops.</v>

927
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.180
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps happening again.</v>

928
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

929
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe like right now there's an earthquake and the ceiling collapses and all of</v>

930
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:19.140
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you're just some daydreaming cabby and Boston like,</v>

931
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:19.381
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

932
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:20.550
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking weird.</v>

933
00:28:20.551 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 2>I was just imagining I was a comedian in la,</v>

934
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:24.550
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean?</v>

935
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:24.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

936
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that's bizarre.</v>

937
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to change lives.</v>

938
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 1>You just snap and do another [inaudible] become the guy rides his body out.</v>

939
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 1>You snap into an alternate life with all your</v>

941
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.310
<v Speaker 2>memories embedded,</v>

942
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.980
<v Speaker 2>everything already embedded in there because it's an infinite,</v>

943
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.843
<v Speaker 2>it's an infinite,</v>

944
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

945
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:38.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

946
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

947
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

948
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.070
<v Speaker 1>it goes on forever.</v>

949
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.160
<v Speaker 1>What if your consciousness is living a bunch of different lives simultaneously</v>

950
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and you just can't,</v>

951
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't see them.</v>

952
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

953
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:45.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

954
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:48.530
<v Speaker 1>an office filled with cubicles and no one's poking their head over the top of</v>

955
00:28:48.531 --> 00:28:48.951
<v Speaker 1>the cubicle.</v>

956
00:28:48.951 --> 00:28:49.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

957
00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

958
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.860
<v Speaker 1>We're all rolling at the same time.</v>

959
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

960
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Or like the way I thought about it is like if you're,</v>

961
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:54.360
<v Speaker 2>if there was like some,</v>

962
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:54.580
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

963
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 2>it sounds really crazy,</v>

964
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but imagine that each of your fingers,</v>

965
00:28:58.021 --> 00:28:58.854
<v Speaker 2>it sounds insane,</v>

966
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>but imagine like each of your fingers had their own personality and their own</v>

967
00:29:02.371 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 2>like consciousness or something.</v>

968
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

969
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 2>and you could stick them through some kind of hole where they would forget they</v>

970
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>were attached to your hand and they would just think that they were their own</v>

971
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:13.080
<v Speaker 2>individual selves.</v>

972
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:13.711
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

973
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that's what we are.</v>

974
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 2>We're just like little fingers protruding into this dimension from some infinite</v>

975
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

976
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 2>But the product of protruding into this dimension as we get instantaneous</v>

977
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 2>amnesia and part of like dealing with a shock of coming into this dimension is</v>

978
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:30.870
<v Speaker 2>we forget our true identity and replace it with our ego structure.</v>

979
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

980
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.470
<v Speaker 1>We'll do it a four minutes and 14 seconds.</v>

981
00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:35.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll just end this because it's fascinating.</v>

982
00:29:35.031 --> 00:29:35.361
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

983
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dissing this guy at all and I fucking love this music and I love,</v>

984
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.490
<v Speaker 1>I love his song and I love that kind of music.</v>

985
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

986
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Toby Keith Song,</v>

987
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.181
<v Speaker 5>I don't have anything wrong.</v>

988
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 5>A patriotic songs at the end of it,</v>

989
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 5>listen to sky does this little speech and this is like this old old dude that's</v>

990
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:49.421
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.453
<v Speaker 5>I love my payment,</v>

994
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.560
<v Speaker 5>I left the way it is now and anybody that tried to change it has to come</v>

995
00:29:58.561 --> 00:29:58.711
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

996
00:29:58.711 --> 00:29:59.544
<v Speaker 5>Mate,</v>

997
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.690
<v Speaker 5>I should be on our head.</v>

998
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Jeez is this is America and a country boy is good enough from make sense?</v>

999
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.610
