<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just use your phone.</v>

10
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Just turned on my Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them,</v>

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>tell them what you were telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

12
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airpods Oh yeah.</v>

13
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new setting on the,</v>

14
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new,</v>

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an operating system where your airpods </v>

16
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>you turned onto this thing called live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>

17
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's listening to the microphone on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your iphone.</v>

18
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>So you can leave your phone in a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk out and you can use.</v>

19
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.693
<v Speaker 1>Just made your own bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that means that anybody that can </v>

20
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>then access your phone could probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>also listen if they have access to that.</v>

21
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.743
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how drive already said like</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you talk to anybody that knows </v>

22
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.643
<v Speaker 1>what's possible with electronics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can already turn your microphone on </v>

23
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>anytime they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pro.</v>

24
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:03.744
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in that book making Shit and </v>

25
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>there was certain bookmakers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't talk in a room that there was a</v>

26
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>phone in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart ones in the seventies.</v>

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.453
<v Speaker 1>Not talking on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there was a phone in the room </v>

28
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>they would leave the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least super paranoid.</v>

30
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.673
<v Speaker 1>They were 30 years ahead of that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you remember how they got Vincent </v>

31
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:25.794
<v Speaker 1>the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started bugging cars along the way </v>

32
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:28.404
<v Speaker 1>where he would walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would walk with his bathrobe like he </v>

33
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:31.284
<v Speaker 1>was crazy and he would give everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructions and he would do it on his </v>

34
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>walk so he couldn't get bugged anywhere.</v>

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So they started bugging the cars along </v>
<v Speaker 1>his walk route.</v>

36
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>That's how they got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get you with the mic?</v>

37
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of the same microphone.</v>

38
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:45.624
<v Speaker 1>They usually nfl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hear all those tackles and </v>

39
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>grunts in the old days they had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parabolic mic.</v>

40
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Takes vibrations from glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So I could just point this laser at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

42
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Which speakers on and they'll take </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're saying in a room and </v>

43
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>bounce it off the glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it.</v>

44
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by now,</v>

45
00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>which world class they can do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're listening to.</v>

46
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

47
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Anything and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I in the bathroom on the plane,</v>

48
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.353
<v Speaker 1>you have to assume that watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I used to go in there and do blast </v>

49
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>a coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always pull my pants down,</v>

50
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.133
<v Speaker 1>go through the whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was shit and that wasn't really </v>

51
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>shit and I just always thought it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>camera there.</v>

52
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.023
<v Speaker 1>Well you'd probably be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard things that are just hard </v>

53
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.263
<v Speaker 1>about vegas in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they had cameras in Vegas in the </v>

54
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.513
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all my vegas and the bathrooms </v>

55
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>have cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you do a blast,</v>

56
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you come out within 10 minutes of cops </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

57
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>When did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did the mob like officially get out</v>

58
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>of Vegas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with the mob is still in Vegas.</v>

59
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Just short spurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

60
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York last week and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized how much construction was going</v>

61
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.853
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

62
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 2>and I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of that is the mob still </v>

63
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>getting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had attacks for years,</v>

64
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 2>two percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it fits a $300,</v>

65
00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>million dollar job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do the math on that.</v>

66
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Speaker 2>You make it a big chunk on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>

67
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.263
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump didn't get rich because the </v>

68
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>construction business is huge and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to New York,</v>

69
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't give you accurate numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know the numbers are.</v>

71
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.590
<v Speaker 2>But look what the averages for a square </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot of concrete in New York.</v>

72
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And look what the averages in Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about that.</v>

73
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>The square foot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build a building in New York,</v>

74
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.233
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The concrete is fucking insane because </v>

75
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>so many hands are getting fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>greased.</v>

76
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't pay a job.</v>

77
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't pay.</v>

78
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like that one episode of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sopranos.</v>

79
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is break your balls.</v>

80
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 2>You would gc you don't want to pay me my</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

81
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.073
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent somebody from the Union and </v>

82
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 2>instead of me doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on through.</v>

83
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I gotta stop you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your book.</v>

84
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I got to call the unit to see if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid your dues.</v>

85
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>We check your tire pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can help.</v>

86
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Let's the windows on the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recently you got 30 trucks backed up and</v>

87
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you're not making any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they shake you down.</v>

88
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 2>That's the shame then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you paid me.</v>

89
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trucks go through.</v>

90
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would sign them.</v>

91
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.213
<v Speaker 2>We don't care who the driver is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't care if it's union or non </v>

92
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:27.844
<v Speaker 2>union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a dirty business at that </v>

93
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shade.</v>

94
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Now trump would be the GC on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pay your job runs smooth,</v>

95
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.713
<v Speaker 2>you don't pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two percent of them went to the mom </v>

96
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:41.124
<v Speaker 2>that concrete tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they had like another two percent </v>

97
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:48.541
<v Speaker 2>right off the top 200 bid rig bedroom </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed rigging.</v>

98
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Where we take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we give it to Joe Rogan.</v>

99
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>No matter what the price is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we inflate the price.</v>

100
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Even though Jamie comes in $3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper,</v>

101
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give Joe Rogan that three </v>
<v Speaker 2>and two more.</v>

102
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's going to kick that to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do the job,</v>

103
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's $3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

104
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Plus I'm going to take two percent off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of that $3,000,000</v>

105
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

106
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I noticed when I was a kid</v>

107
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 3>when I was working construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things I noticed,</v>

108
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:21.441
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the weird businesses that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>run almost exclusively by men like manly</v>

109
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:24.414
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the construction guys were burly </v>

110
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:31.701
<v Speaker 3>dudes with big fucking hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They worked hard and they were like,</v>

111
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 3>these were like rough guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were running a big business.</v>

112
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.003
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these other businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about businesses you think </v>

113
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:43.470
<v Speaker 3>about like computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think about like rugged,</v>

114
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.813
<v Speaker 3>burly guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but computers and construction or just </v>

115
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 3>as calm and like everybody needs a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

116
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Everybody needs a house like </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructions everywhere.</v>

117
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:57.741
<v Speaker 3>It's a gigantic business and it's run at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least in back in when I was working as a</v>

118
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.980
<v Speaker 3>laborer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was run by these big savages too.</v>

119
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Fucking big dangerous guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's gotten more diverse now because</v>

120
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 3>unions have made you hire more women.</v>

121
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 3>When I was no attrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three months and there was a female</v>

122
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.534
<v Speaker 3>supervisor who knew her shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Dad that was electrician when she was </v>

123
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:24.971
<v Speaker 3>a kid that was fucking day job and men </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a tough time working for.</v>

124
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I clicked with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was easy.</v>

125
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 3>She would leave me the fuck alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes men can't.</v>

126
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 3>They just have a real hard time with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman telling me I didn't.</v>

127
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mind that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

128
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 3>I liked her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's great at their job,</v>

129
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 3>they're great at their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of give a fuck what the gender</v>

130
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A weird thing that a lot of guys have,</v>

131
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:46.514
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

132
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>female trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that female trainers.</v>

133
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Female Yoel Romero.</v>

134
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 3>One of the best mother fuckers of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

135
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.050
<v Speaker 3>What is she trained them in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Man's fit.</v>

136
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Strengthen conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was strengthening conditioning.</v>

137
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Training him in this videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching Boston his ass.</v>

138
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like super savage know.</v>

139
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.503
<v Speaker 3>Make sure I'm right about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure my worried about that because </v>

140
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 3>if it's not well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's someone equally savage,</v>

141
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.750
<v Speaker 3>someone who's just fuck this super alpha</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

142
00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 3>No one's a super alpha like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

143
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 3>when we had them in the podcast I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

144
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was saying this guy has built,</v>

145
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not even a real person with 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours should get over.</v>

146
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.953
<v Speaker 3>I remember that night we both had spots </v>
<v Speaker 3>the store and I pulled you aside and I </v>

147
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really think?</v>

148
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you really think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's this guy,</v>

149
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.554
<v Speaker 3>shoot the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is this something that just think </v>

150
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 3>it's genetic super freak genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

151
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 3>when we went to eat at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to New York last week,</v>

152
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.753
<v Speaker 3>I purposely went to a SAR and Tina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a restaurant North Berg and don't </v>

153
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.713
<v Speaker 3>run by this dude named Jocko Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ to spaghetti with a tiny </v>

154
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 3>meatballs.</v>

155
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.823
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even finish it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of his waiters was a wrestler </v>

156
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 3>and listened to the podcast and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying he wasn't that good.</v>

157
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.070
<v Speaker 3>He was on the bottom floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ate the scraps and he.</v>

158
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.801
<v Speaker 3>But he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

159
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I know you're well from back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just last week.</v>

160
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Think about the other super athletes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have come out of Cuba,</v>

161
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 3>but that have gotten into mma and </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing.</v>

162
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hector Lombard,</v>

163
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

164
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might look at Hector lumbar because</v>

165
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 3>of some of his tough fights that he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC later in his career.</v>

166
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 3>But if you go back and watch Hector </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lombard Willingness,</v>

167
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 3>rod and shit and bell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tore.</v>

168
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Those were probably his prime years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the champion at Belterra.</v>

169
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean fucking smashing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smashing people at 185 pounds.</v>

170
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 3>And then he came over to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought one 85,</v>

171
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's a big ass one 80 fives in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC man.</v>

172
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean hector is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

173
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>He's five sex really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that.</v>

174
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's.</v>

175
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I think he's either my height or I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

176
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's either my hydro,</v>

177
00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:06.031
<v Speaker 3>he's an inch taller but he's so jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he was,</v>

178
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 3>when he was smashing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like earlier as career man,</v>

179
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to get him in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

180
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:12.940
<v Speaker 3>this guy needs to come over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

181
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 3>he's so athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

182
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's a judo player.</v>

183
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.941
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

184
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 3>look how fucking checked hector is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

185
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a judo player for Cuba,</v>

186
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.383
<v Speaker 3>but I'm telling you meant did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take all the steroids in the </v>

187
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to move.</v>

188
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh lumbar.</v>

189
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Josh Barnett Rather told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

190
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 3>Hector Lombard when he went to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>could just do muscle up after muscle up.</v>

191
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Never even trained it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's saw.</v>

192
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Jamie will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking hard to do a muscle up.</v>

193
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 3>He just grabs that bar.</v>

194
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 3>He's a super athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just had a lot of really,</v>

195
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 3>really rough fights against the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters in the world.</v>

196
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.273
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think that some of his best </v>

197
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 3>fights you could say like maybe he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested more and I think he certainly was</v>

198
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.973
<v Speaker 3>tested more here in the UFC then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't belt or certainly the caliber of </v>

199
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:03.894
<v Speaker 3>competition is far greater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also think fighters have like a </v>

200
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 3>window of opportunity for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For most of them.</v>

201
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 3>There's exceptions where they can extend</v>
<v Speaker 3>that window,</v>

202
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 3>that window,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the,</v>

203
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 3>the experts seem to think the windows </v>
<v Speaker 3>around nine years.</v>

204
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.013
<v Speaker 3>This is not a number that I invented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a number that I agree with in </v>

205
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:22.704
<v Speaker 3>terms of like the best you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to do it for nine </v>

206
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.034
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fate or the longevity of another </v>

207
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 3>running back a street and a half years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which blew my mind.</v>

208
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That blew my mind.</v>

209
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.080
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talk about all the greats.</v>

210
00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I'd go to a butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Campbell,</v>

211
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Jim Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys.</v>

212
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I thought about their injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How lucky you have to be.</v>

213
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Though.</v>

214
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.453
<v Speaker 3>The UFC is a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people actually did fight in </v>

215
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 3>the UFC for nine years straight so far </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a lot.</v>

216
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 3>There's been quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Lot,</v>

217
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.450
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time there's been a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of guys that have had great both pension</v>

218
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 3>by the fourth or fifth fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've moved on.</v>

219
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

220
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing.</v>

221
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's different in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to recuperate.</v>

222
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's different in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>style.</v>

223
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Like some guys just don't take much </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage,</v>

224
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like Ben Aspirin,</v>

225
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never fought in the UFC,</v>

226
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 3>but when you watch him fight in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other organizations,</v>

227
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 3>thing that's most interesting is that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't take any damage you could say is</v>

228
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>boring if you want to.</v>

229
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.153
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's super high level wrestling </v>

230
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 3>and you need to see how that shit would </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly against the best in the world.</v>

231
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why he's here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very excited about this,</v>

232
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 3>but he's a perfect example of like he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any problems.</v>

233
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 3>That guy has been fighting for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

234
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:46.590
<v Speaker 3>You talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says lucid as they come.</v>

235
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 3>He's articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart,</v>

236
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 3>very well educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reads books all the time.</v>

237
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>He'll send me recommendations for books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

238
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 3>very interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got those guys who like,</v>

239
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.473
<v Speaker 3>he could do it for a long fucking time </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's not taking a beating when </v>

240
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 3>you start taking a beating man pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

241
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.263
<v Speaker 3>some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes guys try to get back in there </v>

242
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 3>too soon and they're still hurting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

243
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a fight,</v>

244
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.504
<v Speaker 3>like a really bad knockout or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sometimes even just getting beaten </v>

245
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 3>up is we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get,</v>

246
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 3>if you don't get stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you incur more damage that way,</v>

247
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long ass fight than you would in a</v>

248
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>quick Kao,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

249
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.410
<v Speaker 3>like I'm in glory.</v>

250
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Valtellina deal,</v>

251
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.773
<v Speaker 3>you know that the zoo could joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was their champion and he won the </v>

252
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.064
<v Speaker 3>title against Mark Dumond after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight couldn't fight again because </v>

253
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 3>concussions were so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't look at a,</v>

254
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 3>the light from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an iphone charger,</v>

255
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.663
<v Speaker 3>like a laptop charger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That little light from that thing would </v>

256
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.293
<v Speaker 3>be blinding to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to be like in a dark room for </v>

257
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cbd Oil brought them out of it.</v>

258
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 3>When I think of fighters and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens during a fight,</v>

259
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.473
<v Speaker 3>I go back all the way to Bernard Hopkins</v>
<v Speaker 3>against Felix trailer that because you </v>

260
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 3>brought it up to my attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never even knew about that world.</v>

261
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.660
<v Speaker 3>He never came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

262
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.890
<v Speaker 3>who's the guy that went the distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's known?</v>

263
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Bella coola fights out of GSPS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't really.</v>

264
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:21.121
<v Speaker 3>Tough guy went five rounds with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's his name is Rory Macdonald.</v>

265
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Rory Rory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After that fight that he had,</v>

266
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.610
<v Speaker 3>he was never really the same title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robbie lawler for Robbie lawler fight.</v>

267
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 3>Fight to affect you in different ways to</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat and you take.</v>

268
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.683
<v Speaker 3>Affects you in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what the kid that Edson </v>

269
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Barboza fights with next time he comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

270
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 3>he took a ferocious beating against at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Edgar Edson,</v>

271
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 3>that last fight before allocated the and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Lee.</v>

272
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.351
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rory,</v>

273
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I got to disagree because after that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

274
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:56.100
<v Speaker 3>he looked fucking phenomenal in beltour </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his first wife.</v>

275
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Who was his first fight and belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or was it Paul Daley?</v>

276
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.220
<v Speaker 3>He fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

277
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 3>but then the next fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't mean he was a beast though.</v>

278
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.803
<v Speaker 3>Dude knew him as a monster man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Douglas Lema is a fucking straight up </v>

279
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 3>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the comedy sometimes.</v>

280
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.220
<v Speaker 3>Was it Paul Daley?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he manhandled Paul daily.</v>

281
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 3>It's very smart fight because he fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>really well on his feet first.</v>

282
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Threatened daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit on his feet and then took him</v>

283
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:20.104
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominated them on the ground and it was </v>

284
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:21.941
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

285
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a very impressive win.</v>

286
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 3>But then he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

287
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:30.090
<v Speaker 3>fighting Musashi I think was probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the,</v>

288
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know.</v>

289
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to test yourself.</v>

290
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 3>There's only one way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he knows better than anybody.</v>

291
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:36.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guys in it to test himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>now he knows that he can't beat massage </v>

292
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 3>at least at this point in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's a smart kid.</v>

293
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Then he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an animal to.</v>

294
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is.</v>

295
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 3>So I will not say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought that a lot of times after</v>

296
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't come back</v>

297
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree on some of them,</v>

298
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with him.</v>

299
00:14:55.221 --> 00:15:00.221
<v Speaker 1>The guy from Texas that took GSP to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoo and he never came.</v>

300
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people give it all.</v>

301
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.880
<v Speaker 1>You got to give it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got moment.</v>

302
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 1>It's either react after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is Kevin legally to come back?</v>

304
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So I quit that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always have those questions,</v>

305
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>which is a great fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

306
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.833
<v Speaker 1>Amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight I was most excited about this </v>

307
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.420
<v Speaker 1>weekend was Michael Gac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos conduit,</v>

308
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good buddy would call those of,</v>

309
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call of little.</v>

310
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Been around for a long fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just name is conduct,</v>

311
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.694
<v Speaker 1>but because he knows I'm his brother and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the biggest fans and the </v>

312
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.603
<v Speaker 1>Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd hire him from the UFC a long time </v>

313
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>ago because he's an assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's realized John,</v>

314
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 1>when you just give him a gun with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>silencer,</v>

315
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.750
<v Speaker 1>a pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him do the rest.</v>

316
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Go down and you could switch his mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick with $600,000</v>

317
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say that his UFC was his debut</v>

318
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:56.350
<v Speaker 1>against Brock Larson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that it was as debut.</v>

319
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Was that in the WEC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that was in the WEC.</v>

320
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I feel like his debut was against um,</v>

321
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.780
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

322

<v Speaker 1>I didn't do a little bungalow and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked him a question after that.</v>

347
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:20.664
<v Speaker 1>He was just frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that he's coming back to redeem </v>

348
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad.</v>

349
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.780
<v Speaker 1>He's never smoked and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was toughest battle.</v>

350
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

351
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.850
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a three foot bong.</v>

352
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

353
00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:34.584
<v Speaker 1>joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people that don't do podcasts </v>

354
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.710
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting on your podcast,</v>

355
00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:41.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a mind fuck because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm here.</v>

356
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here with Uncle Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

357
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 30,</v>

358
00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:47.790
<v Speaker 1>how many percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty one.</v>

359
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 1>That's so high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is alien.</v>

360
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

361
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.330
<v Speaker 1>this is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

362
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Just as a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that don't know the numbers,</v>

363
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>let's find out what the numbers actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

364
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.024
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>

365
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 1>What percentage thc was marijuana in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies?</v>

366
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was like eight to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

367
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny how.</v>

368
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in New York,</v>

369
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.813
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would go to Harlem and what we had </v>

370
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:22.461
<v Speaker 1>available to us was a Panama Red </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colombian gold.</v>

371
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I could be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be running other names.</v>

372
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.833
<v Speaker 1>And then you had from Jamaica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had this week called lamins bread </v>

373
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.183
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green weed came along and they </v>

374
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:36.684
<v Speaker 1>called it since Amelia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was copying a hundred and 48th </v>

375
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.124
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he will either sell your chocolate </v>

376
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.710
<v Speaker 1>pie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is lamb's bread,</v>

377
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.053
<v Speaker 1>or he would sell you a sense of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet he would put them together and call </v>

378
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Speaker 1>it the master mix and then if you bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 bags of the master mix,</v>

379
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.950
<v Speaker 1>she got one for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave you a punch card.</v>

380
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>This is why not go a real punch.</v>

381
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.023
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 83 slash 83.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was in the middle of the corner </v>

382
00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:04.344
<v Speaker 1>hanging out and the funny thing was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went back in [inaudible] 85 and he </v>

383
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:07.720
<v Speaker 1>looked me straight in the face and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

384
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 1>ain't no motherfucking weed on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>

385
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 1>No more dog crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it had just converted to crack,</v>

386
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch him.</v>

387
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I told you that watching Narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

388
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.500
<v Speaker 1>those first two episodes are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because it's like,</v>

389
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like some comments when you watch a</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV show,</v>

390
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.143
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to believe that one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Spanish guy that couldn't even </v>

391
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:30.670
<v Speaker 1>speak English said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

392
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.560
<v Speaker 1>there's not three cameras here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was fucking loose.</v>

393
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Desi Arnaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desi Arnaz invented that.</v>

394
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.080
<v Speaker 1>The three camera shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

395
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.313
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That desi loop production to all that </v>

396
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that said,</v>

397
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.820
<v Speaker 1>took her eight white people sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

398
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 1>get two more cameras.</v>

399
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's go underlay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

400
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.013
<v Speaker 1>the guy that did the principle Guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Narcos to share is a character who grew </v>

401
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:00.930
<v Speaker 1>weed in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about that,</v>

402
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 1>and I've never been even thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

403
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 1>but by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the science,</v>

404
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>so please Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't torture me.</v>

405
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.860
<v Speaker 1>He eliminated the male plant to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>female stronger.</v>

406
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>The only way you could grow that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert,</v>

407
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.714
<v Speaker 1>so he found water in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the only way you can go grow </v>

408
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.134
<v Speaker 1>in the desert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something about the climate to to </v>

409
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.900
<v Speaker 1>roof so that it's like the immaculate </v>
<v Speaker 1>conception when you get pregnant without</v>

410
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.583
<v Speaker 1>getting pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you eliminate the male plants or </v>

411
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.104
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know this information and we </v>

412
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:35.754
<v Speaker 1>have to hide this information from women</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no seeds and the reefer get </v>

413
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That started in the eighties.</v>

414
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you watched Narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

415
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.740
<v Speaker 1>it shows you how that whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>started</v>

416
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.103
<v Speaker 2>and they were pumping 15 metric tons a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year into the United States with this </v>

417
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>shit green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd became Mexican.</v>

418
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:59.851
<v Speaker 2>Green Weed was when we started smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to say that average was maybe 15.</v>

419
00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:06.631
<v Speaker 2>Then like the strongest and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeds down 21 percent.</v>

420
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.043
<v Speaker 2>They take me to the fucking mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that 28 or above and a bong you'd </v>

421
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:13.594
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started in your mum when you're </v>

422
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 2>fucking can't focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that feeling.</v>

423
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Speaker 2>At night when I listened to music,</v>

424
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big music will not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called you.</v>

425
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:25.663
<v Speaker 2>It was like October third and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to call you to tell you that I </v>

426
00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 2>love to participate in so broad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of my love for music,</v>

427
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:33.934
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is to go home at night or </v>

428
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.233
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I go to the office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I told you my house is dead at 20 </v>

429
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 2>to nine or 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my wife's in bed 10 minutes later.</v>

430
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Some nights I don't have a spa podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go to my office.</v>

431
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I bring a notebook on my ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my get stoned,</v>

432
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.243
<v Speaker 2>and I put it on the album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go down the album road and I just get </v>

433
00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:00.350
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and listen to that music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

434
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 2>That's my hobby and once a week I go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the album store and buying a while.</v>

435
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.113
<v Speaker 2>New Vinyl album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lately I would now that led Zepplin to </v>

436
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the greatest,</v>

437
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.320
<v Speaker 2>dirtiest filthiest opens up with a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of love.</v>

438
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just dirty lemon song and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heartbreak at.</v>

439
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 2>It's just dirty and then I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to fucking physical graffiti.</v>

440
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I love going into those foxholes way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that knightstone</v>

441
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that music.</v>

442
00:22:38.041 --> 00:22:38.874
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the first drug culture music </v>

443
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.780
<v Speaker 3>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

444
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.900
<v Speaker 3>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Zeppelin and pink floyd showed up,</v>

445
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.960
<v Speaker 2>but they went to India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grew long hand.</v>

446
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 2>They came back with those four items.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there was rumors of acid.</v>

447
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.610
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to the one robotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it revolve.</v>

448
00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:05.611
<v Speaker 2>One of those John Lennon spreads acid </v>
<v Speaker 2>bond that was there.</v>

449
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of musicians from that era</v>

450
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 3>that are great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't associated with drugs,</v>

451
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 3>but if you think of Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think of.</v>

452
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean Hendrix was always associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with drugs.</v>

453
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Janis Joplin always associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>

454
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good or bad.</v>

455
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.650
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting.</v>

456
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sound is so.</v>

457
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.890
<v Speaker 3>It lasts like it's so relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to some Zeplin today,</v>

458
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.670
<v Speaker 3>it's still so God damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were so good.</v>

459
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.660
<v Speaker 3>They were so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solon Zeplin</v>

<v Speaker 2>Zepplin too.</v>

464
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.403

<v Speaker 2>I got that office that I put on such a </v>

465
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:58.484
<v Speaker 2>part of my childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about my mom coming into the </v>

466
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:06.131
<v Speaker 2>room saying yelling lower that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>devil music saying weight bias.</v>

00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I mostly got bar on it and I would blast</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at fucking six.</v>

468
00:24:11.371 --> 00:24:12.540
<v Speaker 2>No morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the neighbors next door with Jehovah </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnesses and he would knock on my door.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You have to please lower your music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never loaded.</v>

471
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Lowered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that age I had a fissure stereo.</v>

472
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I already knew not to get </v>

473
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:28.990
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was already hit.</v>

474
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I never bought the album with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight track and the cassette.</v>

475
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.673
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought an amp and I bought on a </v>

476
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.130
<v Speaker 2>cassette deck and I had a turntable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would fucking blasted.</v>

477
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I got the speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

478
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:46.100
<v Speaker 2>I bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fell off a truck.</v>

479
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I love music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loud my store every time till this day,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

482
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I think of my mother banging on the door</v>
<v Speaker 2>for freshman year going if I got a knock</v>

483
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:04.634

<v Speaker 2>I'm throwing that out the window like </v>

485
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joining,</v>

486
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.860
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to walk up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoking and joy.</v>

487
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't smoke at the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like that.</v>

488
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 2>She had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We play an album albums,</v>

489
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 2>the record player.</v>

490
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still did you have a good needle?</v>

491
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Memory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd go over to houses,</v>

492
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 2>they had a special needle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you go to the NATO?</v>

493
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I just went and got new needles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to order them online.</v>

494
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Fucking impressive guy and I got fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool looking needle.</v>

495
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.103
<v Speaker 2>I still had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend that had a reel to reel </v>

496
00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.573
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a record player in my house for </v>

497
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

498
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.960
<v Speaker 2>You gotta reel to reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine had a real reel in high</v>

499
00:25:51.961 --> 00:25:53.510
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

500
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And the sound he bought the speakers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

501
00:25:56.181 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 2>He was a sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could hear like the musician pulling</v>

502
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>away from the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like was that good?</v>

503
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 2>So when he's playing this reel to reel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got like a,</v>

504
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 2>like a projector screen type deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

505
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.843
<v Speaker 2>he had a room like this and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a shelf and on the shelf he had </v>

506
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.673
<v Speaker 2>speakers and he had a real real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've connected and it will have </v>

507
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 2>two or three hours of music on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever he would have a party,</v>

508
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 2>he would just put on the reel to reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that time.</v>

509
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the threat that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reel to reel.</v>

510
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.930
<v Speaker 2>That's projector,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

511
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.860
<v Speaker 2>It's going to reel to reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the new threat.</v>

512
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 2>That's never made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it went from,</v>

513
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it went from albums to cassettes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking cds.</v>

514
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.943
<v Speaker 5>So if you put something through that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have to Kinda like do it like you </v>

515
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:50.544
<v Speaker 5>were working in the projection room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You take the magnetic from one of them </v>

516
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.444
<v Speaker 5>and it works almost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just really large cassette tape </v>

517
00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:57.354
<v Speaker 5>player.</v>

518
00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.250
<v Speaker 2>How he put the music on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget how he put the music on that.</v>

519
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Could you buy music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

520
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is recording</v>

521
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.153
<v Speaker 5>but not ness to it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could have recorded something on </v>

522
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 5>there if you had a cable to plug it into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

523
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 5>I forget how many copies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

524
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.343
<v Speaker 5>the same way you'd put your original </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be like on the left you tend to </v>

525
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:17.800
<v Speaker 5>feed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did it.</v>

526
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.633
<v Speaker 5>You'd need a copier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't do it with this machine </v>

527
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:20.604
<v Speaker 5>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that the same way people did with </v>

528
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:24.230
<v Speaker 5>VCR copies back in the early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

529
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.730
<v Speaker 5>tape to tape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd find the same thing,</v>

530
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:31.731
<v Speaker 5>how it would degrade each generation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get forms for your friend and it was</v>

531
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 5>like someone threw mud in your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tried to watch it.</v>

532
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:36.054
<v Speaker 5>The fuck is happening on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was so many generations of </v>

533
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:39.174
<v Speaker 5>copied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember when porn was wife's </v>

534
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.280
<v Speaker 5>like this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember,</v>

535
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.133
<v Speaker 5>but I heard about it and I remember that</v>
<v Speaker 5>movie about the dude from Hogan's </v>

536
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 5>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a,</v>

537
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

538
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 5>he was on Hogan's heroes and after </v>
<v Speaker 5>hoping his heroes,</v>

539
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.820
<v Speaker 5>he just went around making his own </v>
<v Speaker 5>homemade porn and he,</v>

540
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had one of these kinds of things.</v>

541
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:02.490
<v Speaker 5>When the home projector type deals,</v>

542
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.643
<v Speaker 2>porn came in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you went to the back of a dirty </v>

543
00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:10.730
<v Speaker 2>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playboy and Penthouse,</v>

544
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:15.140
<v Speaker 2>but anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would actually send you a projector</v>

545
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 2>with three movies for say 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95.</v>

546
00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a low end project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably going to work 10 times,</v>

547
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.300
<v Speaker 2>but at least you got to watch porn and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd send you a reel to reel.</v>

548
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:30.883
<v Speaker 2>That was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porn was so bad and I still remember a </v>

549
00:28:36.891 --> 00:28:37.724
<v Speaker 2>story with me and my friends chipping in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting the fucking reel to reel </v>

550
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.343
<v Speaker 2>with the thing and plugging it into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall and putting sheets on the windows </v>

551
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.530
<v Speaker 2>and it was just horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible born white chicks.</v>

552
00:28:54.531 --> 00:28:55.364
<v Speaker 2>They would find them off the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flapjack Teddy's somebody turned </v>

553
00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:03.821
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes off on a chest and this chick</v>
<v Speaker 2>was half on drugs and she had a suck the</v>

554
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.000
<v Speaker 2>guy's Dick in the most vivid picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>

555
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.020
<v Speaker 2>When she took the mayonnaise with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>

556
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:10.923
<v Speaker 2>like she was sucking this guy's Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy's Dick had been beat up and she </v>

557
00:29:15.351 --> 00:29:17.000
<v Speaker 2>took mayonnaise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miracle Whip.</v>

558
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.403
<v Speaker 2>That's why I never liked miracle whip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put it on the bread and made a Dick </v>

559
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dick and it was like me and three</v>

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.193
<v Speaker 2>the dollar 95 for shipping and handling </v>
<v Speaker 2>has an h and then they will take six </v>

575
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.730
<v Speaker 2>weeks to delivery so you would just sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you couldn't send it to your house,</v>

576
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.253
<v Speaker 2>so I would have to send it to Rogan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>house because I knew his mother and his </v>

577
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 2>grandmother worked all day so they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>never be home,</v>

578
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 2>so they would just drop the package off </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of the house.</v>

579
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.930
<v Speaker 2>If one of our mothers found that </v>
<v Speaker 2>baggage,</v>

580
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.773
<v Speaker 2>we'd be dead.</v>

581
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.533
<v Speaker 2>We'd be fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can You Imagine Your Mother Checkmate </v>

582
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.760
<v Speaker 2>with Miracle Whip on a piece of bread </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eats into the fucking your deck with</v>

583

<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

584
00:30:34.961 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 2>flinch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if,</v>

585
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:37.864
<v Speaker 2>what if they found their kid with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and his complaint </v>

586
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:41.680

<v Speaker 2>always going to be that little boy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're worried about you getting so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many pregnant because you're so stupid </v>

601
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.350

<v Speaker 2>16,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How good are you at that?</v>

605
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you were that young,</v>

606
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents are worried about you doing</v>

607
00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:38.040
<v Speaker 2>something dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your parents worried about you.</v>

608
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Getting pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also don't want you having sex.</v>

609
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.163
<v Speaker 2>I had the skinny girl friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I always had girls that were </v>

610
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 2>friends and then after the girls leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom would pull me aside and said,</v>

611
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

612
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:53.164
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's just a friend and I would have </v>

613
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:57.070
<v Speaker 2>stayed out of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it.</v>

614
00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were friends,</v>

615
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>but that was just one skinny girl.</v>

616
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.963
<v Speaker 2>But I used to bring home in the seventh </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade and my mother caught us one </v>

617
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 2>afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She called US making out.</v>

618
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 2>So she asked me as a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes from now on,</v>

619
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>do me a fucking favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she's here and I'm downstairs,</v>

620
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:15.750
<v Speaker 2>just leave the door open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom was one of those dog.</v>

621
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:17.523
<v Speaker 2>She was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do me a favor just from the Middle </v>

622
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.100
<v Speaker 2>East when I leave and lock the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm here,</v>

623
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.033
<v Speaker 2>just leave the door open and I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave it open the foot and then try to </v>

624
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 2>eight inches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six inches and she would have to come up</v>

625
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:36.240
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you with the fucking door open</v>

626
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.530
<v Speaker 2>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an animal at that age.</v>

627
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.863
<v Speaker 2>So at that age you for how we talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him yet because all I was doing was dry </v>

628
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>humping this girl.</v>

629
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 2>That's all I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't having sex.</v>

630
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I think I sent the one time we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>having sex,</v>

631
00:32:49.481 --> 00:32:50.314
<v Speaker 2>we were just making out dry humping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one day I had my mom had the bar </v>

632
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:58.901
<v Speaker 2>stool and she would just fucking come </v>
<v Speaker 2>home in the afternoon to see if I was at</v>

633
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>this broad and one dad in here and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought one up,</v>

634
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:04.484
<v Speaker 2>friends up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of her friends were there and I've </v>

635
00:33:07.591 --> 00:33:09.460
<v Speaker 2>been there just swap and split with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chip.</v>

636
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.470
<v Speaker 2>But I hear something on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something is going on.</v>

637
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.010
<v Speaker 2>But I kept dry humping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had earth,</v>

638
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>wind and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I love great fucking arm off.</v>

639
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.653
<v Speaker 2>That's the way of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving them in this check that you </v>

640
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

641
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.693
<v Speaker 2>I hear a lot of slip and the guy starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling and I ran downstairs and there </v>

642
00:33:33.561 --> 00:33:34.960
<v Speaker 2>was one of my mother's friends.</v>

643
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.510
<v Speaker 2>He used to be a bookie at my mother's </v>
<v Speaker 2>boss,</v>

644
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 2>so my mother goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get to the bottom of this.</v>

645
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I got to know what this kid's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>late.</v>

646
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.993
<v Speaker 2>So he volunteers at the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the side of the house to see if I'm </v>

647
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 2>getting laid to look in the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an air conditioner with a curtain.</v>

648
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.693
<v Speaker 2>He could never see it anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this girl pissed off my mom fie </v>

649
00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This went on for about a year and then I</v>

650
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:03.374
<v Speaker 2>started taking his shirt off and suck in</v>
<v Speaker 2>attendance and my dad came home when </v>

651
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 2>they caught him in a closet and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>

652
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And then my mom would give me shit for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little while.</v>

653
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.180
<v Speaker 2>I got to be 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>

654
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.083
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and this girl would watch the </v>

655
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:20.024

<v Speaker 2>Donny and Marie and I would get pissed </v>

656
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 2>off because she had a crush on fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donnie.</v>

657
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You're a kid and then one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we figured out,</v>

658
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:32.460

661
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:43.100
<v Speaker 2>nobody will know your grandmother works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother is definitely not coming home.</v>

662
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 2>So we used to play hooky and one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>they caught us and her and I had like,</v>

663

<v Speaker 3>You've got 15 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone sucking his dick,</v>

689
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.670
<v Speaker 3>some dirty little girl down the block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

690
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.953
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's all endure all the time and </v>

691
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 3>obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's driving you nuts.</v>

692

<v Speaker 3>How's your baby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your baby stuck with some tramp tramp.</v>

694
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hell on earth.</v>

695
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Having a daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun now.</v>

696
00:36:54.711 --> 00:36:56.380
<v Speaker 2>It's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She puts costume.</v>

697
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.880
<v Speaker 2>She loves daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She watches TV,</v>

698
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but there's an accommodation once to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the mall with her friends.</v>

699
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the letter you have to worry and it's </v>

700
00:37:05.721 --> 00:37:07.760
<v Speaker 2>not the same world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

701
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.403
<v Speaker 3>the world is not the same now and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to be the same when they're </v>

702
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.610
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting weirder and weirder.</v>

703
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting,</v>

704
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking earlier about bugs and </v>

705
00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:20.780
<v Speaker 3>searches and people being will turn your</v>
<v Speaker 3>microphones on.</v>

706
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.700
<v Speaker 3>It has a matter of time before there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no privacy.</v>

707
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's 100 years.</v>

708
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I think there's gonna be no </v>
<v Speaker 3>privacy with anything.</v>

709
00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think with your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're going to.</v>

710
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.583
<v Speaker 3>The next thing after cell phones is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be something that allows us to </v>

711
00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:43.090
<v Speaker 3>communicate way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna.</v>

712
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.963
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna within the next 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come up with some way </v>

713
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:49.760
<v Speaker 3>where we're going to be all communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>through what device.</v>

714
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be better than just </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

715
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.260
<v Speaker 3>We're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to share thoughts.</v>

716
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.780
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

717
00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.613
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hundred percent convinced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of this stuff is just </v>

718
00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:02.090
<v Speaker 3>getting everything accelerates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

719
00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.163
<v Speaker 3>It used to be really hard to get ahold </v>
<v Speaker 3>of somebody and now it's really easy to </v>

720
00:38:04.971 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Speaker 3>get ahold of somebody and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

721
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.413
<v Speaker 3>People figured out ways to turn people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>microphones on and record them and </v>

722
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.870
<v Speaker 3>people are putting tape over their </v>
<v Speaker 3>webcam.</v>

723
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I want you to look at while I'm checking</v>
<v Speaker 3>off like did they think someone's gonna?</v>

724
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Look through it from the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably can.</v>

725
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.420
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a matter of time before</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody can with everybody,</v>

726
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.880
<v Speaker 3>with everything you do is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be all,</v>

727
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.010
<v Speaker 3>all information available to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to happen.</v>

728
00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 3>We're so far away from where we were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies so far away,</v>

729
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 3>so far away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far away and that was our lifetime.</v>

730
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 3>We can remember the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

731
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 3>1973.</v>

732
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 3>I was six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

733
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

734
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.013
<v Speaker 3>I remember the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when the war ended thinking </v>

735
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:50.044
<v Speaker 3>when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is great that the war is over </v>

736
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 3>because now they know that war is bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they won't do any war anymore.</v>

737
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 3>The war is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

738
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 3>And then when the war started up again </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was,</v>

739
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I think I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Desert Storm kicked in,</v>

740
00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

741
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:06.070
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and my friend Jimmy,</v>

742
00:39:06.071 --> 00:39:11.071
<v Speaker 3>to tell you we had an apartment in.</v>

<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

748
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:23.824
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think we had a couch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just sit in there in the living room </v>

749
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:30.760
<v Speaker 3>watching these fucking missiles flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air and I'll never forget.</v>

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.010
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

801
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I remember us being out and them saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>Freddy Prince died.</v>

802
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:29.810
<v Speaker 2>He shot himself last night and I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember how cold it was,</v>

803
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 2>January or February.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking freezing,</v>

804
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.603
<v Speaker 2>but we were walking home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were 12 and what do we see in front </v>

805
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 2>of this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Passed out drunk.</v>

806
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Just hammered drunk on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>

807
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.770
<v Speaker 2>let's get the money out of his pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the bottle.</v>

808
00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bottle of dewar's or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

809
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 2>So our plan was to take a bottle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shake a bum.</v>

810
00:42:53.001 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

811
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 2>You roll a bum and we put our hands in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his pocket.</v>

812
00:42:57.591 --> 00:42:58.424
<v Speaker 2>He grabbed one of us like Gary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So next they don't have to realize it's </v>

813
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.183
<v Speaker 2>just started kicking him like we must </v>
<v Speaker 2>have kicked the maybe two times and we </v>

814
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:12.420
<v Speaker 2>ran away the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be chases Jesus shirt,</v>

815
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.410
<v Speaker 2>pet cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we lost them.</v>

816
00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you get all those weird things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I associate with like Freddy</v>

817
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.583
<v Speaker 2>Shadow himself at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must have mentioned it in the </v>

818
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:24.584
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was too busy going to school and it </v>

819
00:43:26.631 --> 00:43:31.631
<v Speaker 2>wasn't confirmed until the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how slow new was.</v>

820
00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.013
<v Speaker 2>Now you're getting news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get hit with 200 stories in 10 </v>

821
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened in prints?</v>

822
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.240
<v Speaker 2>What trump decided what the UFC is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

823
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.750
<v Speaker 2>What fucking Penny Marshall died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get natural all day.</v>

824
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>You really can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your child.</v>

825
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.130
<v Speaker 2>You've watched these two young girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow up.</v>

826
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever have days where you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>them somewhere?</v>

827
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Disney and it's so much information </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got to go back.</v>

828
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to us.</v>

829
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be happening to us.</v>

830
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Well for sure it's wearing you out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of it is really negative too.</v>

831
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.913
<v Speaker 2>That's another part of the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting to people is what's </v>

832
00:44:18.351 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and there's not much </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

833
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.250
<v Speaker 2>so what's interesting to people becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>being negative,</v>

834
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 2>being nasty about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about things,</v>

835
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.243
<v Speaker 2>bitching about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting starting twitter fights like </v>

836
00:44:31.651 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

837
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.843
<v Speaker 3>enjoy doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like they're looking for for </v>

838
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:35.844
<v Speaker 3>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wished there was a way where people </v>

839
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.391
<v Speaker 3>could choose to only engage online </v>
<v Speaker 3>without insulting people and just trying</v>

840
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 3>to get a rise out of people like a troll</v>
<v Speaker 3>free way of interacting,</v>

841
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:51.444
<v Speaker 3>but it's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got to kind of accept what it is </v>

842
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you accept what it is,</v>

843
00:44:55.770 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 3>you should be very wary about entering </v>
<v Speaker 3>to anything.</v>

844
00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 3>We're 60 percent of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing is negative.</v>

845
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.780
<v Speaker 3>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything in life where you're looking at</v>

846
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.410
<v Speaker 3>60 percent negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do it.</v>

847
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Like being informed is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's more than just being informed</v>

848
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 3>because how much of that information is </v>
<v Speaker 3>even valuable to you?</v>

849
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.153
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is just getting soaked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soaked into these fucking horrible </v>

850
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.230
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

851
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.083
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went down a rabbit hole the other day </v>

852
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:24.680
<v Speaker 3>reading about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

853
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.160
<v Speaker 3>these Scandinavian tourists that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>beheaded in Morocco,</v>

854
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.590
<v Speaker 3>in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These girls were hitchhiking and went,</v>

855
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible,</v>

856
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:35.300
<v Speaker 3>horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt.</v>

857
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.550
<v Speaker 3>And then I watched a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible</v>

858
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.680
<v Speaker 2>showroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

859
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I love your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

860
00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.590
<v Speaker 2>logo headshot going to Morocco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mind your fucking business.</v>

861
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Girls apparently did this all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

862
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.473
<v Speaker 2>Either you're talking about a guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking went somewhere and tried to </v>

863
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:55.630
<v Speaker 2>convert a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed up with a fucking Bible.</v>

864
00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You Mind Your Business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I send the fucking Bible via mail and</v>

865
00:46:00.101 --> 00:46:00.934
<v Speaker 2>do the best you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people will want to put themselves </v>

866
00:46:02.891 --> 00:46:06.850
<v Speaker 2>in danger's way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking hate that shit.</v>

867
00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like controlling my situation.</v>

868
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sound shallow.</v>

869
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:16.203
<v Speaker 2>I would love to be able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>passport and go to China and go to </v>

870
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going nowhere.</v>

871
00:46:20.561 --> 00:46:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Whether there's nothing fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

872
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

873
00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear a bomb when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking sleep and when I'm in Israel,</v>

874
00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.660
<v Speaker 2>talked to her the other day.</v>

875
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.430
<v Speaker 2>You gave bombs going off telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes on the phone.</v>

876
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Speaker 2>You can hear a bomb going off and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that.</v>

877
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't need none of that shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting yourself in harm's way,</v>

878
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I appreciate the balls.</v>

879
00:46:47.411 --> 00:46:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balls.</v>

880
00:46:49.031 --> 00:46:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Are you climbing a mountain agero?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate all that stuff,</v>

881
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's not in my percentage graph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in percentages.</v>

882
00:46:57.851 --> 00:46:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You understand me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

883
00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:04.471
<v Speaker 2>So it's just the other night I read to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get high at night guys.</v>

884
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I do comedy and to come down I smoke 55 </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Bong hits.</v>

885
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you don't have to say a joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>on twitter.</v>

886
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.630
<v Speaker 2>The joke is written when you read it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being,</v>

887
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you're saying this is a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>article,</v>

888
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it does have </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of humor in it.</v>

889
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:29.320
<v Speaker 2>There's an article of a hot chick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it says,</v>

890
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:30.154
<v Speaker 2>mother goes to court to complain about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher who fucked a 15 year old kid </v>

891
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 2>because his life has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has never been the same since she fucked</v>

892
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

893
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Show it as the kid's never going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>his dick.</v>

894
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:44.554
<v Speaker 2>Suck like that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine getting a teacher to </v>

895
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 2>blow your horn when you're in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school?</v>

896
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:49.684
<v Speaker 2>One of those dirty teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See a picture of a Joe Rogan with a </v>

897
00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:52.244
<v Speaker 2>fresh and a boat with a bikini.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you take this chick to the prom and </v>

898
00:47:56.321 --> 00:47:57.820
<v Speaker 2>she sucking your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan.</v>

899
00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.021
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

900
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I've never done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

901
00:48:00.941 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Like reluctant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His life is changed.</v>

902
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.063
<v Speaker 2>It's a joke dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to attack the two days and I </v>

903
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:12.040
<v Speaker 2>didn't reattach people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned it around on them.</v>

904
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I called them love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

905
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Merry Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had no where to go.</v>

906
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny that you could get caught </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>

907
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.240
<v Speaker 2>They forget what Comedians we are a a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>

908
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:31.020
<v Speaker 2>a tube that transport something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly into something that's still ugly,</v>

909
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:32.740
<v Speaker 2>but a little bit of funny to it.</v>

910
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I cracked a joke when I found my mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead on the floor to myself,</v>

911
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 2>which I knew she was never going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

912
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.133
<v Speaker 2>I got left back because I got back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never told and it was coming on a </v>

913
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a tower.</v>

914
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 2>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept asking me,</v>

915
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.573
<v Speaker 2>have you chosen to college yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a sophomore year for three </v>

916
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:53.530
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran the scam of my mother.</v>

917
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell her she thought I was a junior.</v>

918
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I was a sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as soon as I made that turn,</v>

919
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I picked her up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw arm was purple.</v>

920
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I kissed her forehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember popping up and going.</v>

921
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I knew this wasn't going to have a fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I before.</v>

922
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I dial nine one one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I dropped humor at that situation,</v>

923
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 2>that's how I fucking handle myself.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to argue with them for it's not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth it.</v>

939
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.054
<v Speaker 2>If they played the tape back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd laugh at yourself and feel </v>

940
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:28.364
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

946
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:52.480

<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

951
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not like somebody giving you money </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're pointing you in the house for</v>

952
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it Dell resurfaces from the grave,</v>

<v Speaker 1>How much does it really affect you at?</v>

957
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.143
<v Speaker 1>At least that's how I've always thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with all these shows is all </v>

958
00:51:29.901 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's CNN or Fox News,</v>

959
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 1>is that they're leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're leaning in somewhere.</v>

960
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 1>The lean in one there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you about the news,</v>

961
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:37.724
<v Speaker 1>but they're leaning on it in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just simply recording the </v>

962
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Fox News.</v>

963
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lean like,</v>

964
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.163
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you guys are talking </v>

965
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:49.190
<v Speaker 1>about when you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will tell you.</v>

966
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people talk to me about left and </v>

967
00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:54.650
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea because I don't even know</v>

968
00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:59.651
<v Speaker 1>where I stand on most issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what I did see in New York and</v>

969
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:00.854
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey last week take a guess of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did not see homeless people </v>

970
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.290
<v Speaker 1>really like because it's so cold.</v>

971
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I was homeless for Nineteen Days in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York in December,</v>

972
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:16.163
<v Speaker 1>December twelfth through the 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First I got a hotel room maybe 50 </v>

973
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:19.484
<v Speaker 1>percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but besides that I was homeless at one </v>

974
00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:26.800
<v Speaker 1>time in 1984.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually I ask people and you say,</v>

975
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.873
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw very small sections of not </v>

976
00:52:32.411 --> 00:52:33.244
<v Speaker 1>encampments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but homeless present percentage was </v>

977
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 1>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I asked somebody what that is.</v>

978
00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 1>How come I have somebody homeless people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out here?</v>

979
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 1>They said it's was because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals.</v>

980
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fucking know that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal was.</v>

981
00:52:47.271 --> 00:52:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

982
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 1>California is liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just try to be a human being.</v>

983
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense.</v>

984
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

985
00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Then what were the homeless go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we make more of them out here?</v>

986
00:52:57.201 --> 00:53:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he's saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you allow it to Las Vegas?</v>

987
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me that Las Vegas ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're homeless,</v>

988
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:08.790
<v Speaker 1>scares them a bus to California and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the ship.</v>

989
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.153
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the shipping is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>busting people like Alaska for a little </v>

990
00:53:12.381 --> 00:53:13.920
<v Speaker 1>while or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years.</v>

991
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 1>You saw the TV show wild wild country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that?</v>

992
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>It's on the niche is that I said rag </v>
<v Speaker 1>niche,</v>

993
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.240

994
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Oregon and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they did to,</v>

995
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:34.430
<v Speaker 3>they took over the town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all heard about it and watched it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>all those people vote.</v>

997
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.450
<v Speaker 3>And then they took over the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>

998
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:46.010
<v Speaker 3>They're like developed a real town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they took over this one area of</v>

999
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.230
<v Speaker 3>bust out how America moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's homelessness.</v>

1000
00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.093
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each year us city gives thousands of </v>

1001
00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:51.794
<v Speaker 3>homeless people one way bus tickets out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of town and 18 month Nathan nationwide </v>

1002
00:53:54.951 --> 00:53:55.784
<v Speaker 3>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Guardian reveals for the first </v>

1003
00:53:57.141 --> 00:53:59.450
<v Speaker 3>time what really happens at journey's </v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

1004

<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

1007
00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like they just move them away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they sit where they ship them?</v>

1008
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1009
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Looks like they're throwing them down in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miami and in La.</v>

1010
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in Colorado.</v>

1011
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 1>In Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would.</v>

1012
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.313
<v Speaker 1>The homeless people would commit crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured out what crimes they would </v>

1013
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:40.431
<v Speaker 1>get 60 days for and they would commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that crime,</v>

1014
00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.073
<v Speaker 1>plead guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the 60 days just to get a little </v>

1015
00:54:44.331 --> 00:54:49.160
<v Speaker 1>winter because in those days boulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>would give you tobacco.</v>

1016
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.930
<v Speaker 1>You were allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will give you tobacco,</v>

1017
00:54:52.931 --> 00:54:57.931
<v Speaker 1>but you had a role in that Boulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>County jail in 1991,</v>

1018
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:00.393
<v Speaker 1>Boulder County jail and some other jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're voted number one and two jails in </v>

1021
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and it became fucking commy this land </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Aspen Cardenas land.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like no cigarettes.</v>

1023
00:55:17.591 --> 00:55:18.424
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had to wear uniforms no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staying up till two in the morning when </v>

1027
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:33.320
<v Speaker 1>It got out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got out that it was too nice.</v>

1028
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:34.663
<v Speaker 1>So like I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeless people will commit a crime to </v>

1029
00:55:36.381 --> 00:55:37.310
<v Speaker 1>do 60 days.</v>

1030
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.233
<v Speaker 3>Can I ask you something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a person who's been in jail that </v>

1031
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:43.940
<v Speaker 3>would it motivate you more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an honest question.</v>

1032
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:44.803
<v Speaker 3>Would it motivate you more if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail and it was nice and comfortable </v>

1033
00:55:48.291 --> 00:55:49.124
<v Speaker 3>in there and you got to relax and calm </v>
<v Speaker 3>down or would it motivate you more if </v>

1034
00:55:52.371 --> 00:55:53.204
<v Speaker 3>they brought you into some communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>type jail as you described it with </v>

1035
00:55:55.551 --> 00:55:56.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd wear uniforms there.</v>

1036
00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.820
<v Speaker 3>No cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no fun.</v>

1037
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:03.290
<v Speaker 3>They limited your outside time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I did them both,</v>

1038
00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:04.873
<v Speaker 3>what would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think is a person who's been </v>

1039
00:56:06.501 --> 00:56:09.320
<v Speaker 3>through what would be most effective in </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitating you?</v>

1040
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:13.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea,</v>

1041
00:56:13.211 --> 00:56:16.550
<v Speaker 1>right and rehabilitative right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said to me,</v>

1042
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stay this fucking building for</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>

1043
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like Pablo jail.</v>

1044
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.343
<v Speaker 2>It's still jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to remember that you can not </v>

1045
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 2>leave the building for six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will let you go out to the front and a</v>

1046
00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:35.014
<v Speaker 2>cage one hour a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to figure out what you're </v>

1047
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:41.440
<v Speaker 2>going to do in a for 12 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cage.</v>

1048
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have more options here.</v>

1049
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I can lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do different parts of my body.</v>

1050
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I could shoot pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1051
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:48.131
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1052
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:48.401
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1053
00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boulder was very simple.</v>

1054
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Boldly got locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave you lemons.</v>

1055
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.820
<v Speaker 2>You either took them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only at my own clothes.</v>

1056
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:02.470
<v Speaker 2>So you called home at lunchtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan brought me my jeans,</v>

1057
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 2>my sneakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my tee shirts.</v>

1058
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.463
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing my own clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now they determined what you're in </v>

1059
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:10.510
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonviolent and violent.</v>

1060
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 2>If you're a nonviolent defender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you the world is yours.</v>

1061
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.473
<v Speaker 2>The violent ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that get lumped in with the </v>

1062
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 2>other ones.</v>

1063
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 2>So now the violent offenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1064
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:26.821
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you do as violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into one sector and that sector,</v>

1065
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 2>the longer you're in there in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more rewards you get.</v>

1066
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.633
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stay up till 10 and they got cable </v>

1067
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:38.340
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are red,</v>

1068
00:57:38.341 --> 00:57:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you stay up till 11 and they ain't got </v>
<v Speaker 2>cable TV.</v>

1069
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 2>If you're purple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stepped on one.</v>

1070
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 2>One Am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1071
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Boulder County jail was tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured I didn't drink milk.</v>

1072
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Milk is big in jail because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilders like milk.</v>

1073
00:57:55.151 --> 00:58:00.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like fucking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would trade you and you my milk for</v>

1074
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:03.060
<v Speaker 2>your Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1075
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:07.760
<v Speaker 2>So I was in there drinking fucking cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit because I fucking hate.</v>

1076
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:09.783
<v Speaker 2>Boulder was a paradise compared to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>jails all listen to this thanksgiving </v>

1077
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:16.150
<v Speaker 2>day when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I locked up.</v>

1078
00:58:16.151 --> 00:58:16.984
<v Speaker 2>Thanks every day at the guard came in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll never forget his name was ron </v>

1079
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:22.533
<v Speaker 2>and he opened up the cell door and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a phone that was anybody who needs </v>

1080
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:27.820
<v Speaker 2>to use the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the phone.</v>

1081
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.343
<v Speaker 2>I figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those days you had to press </v>

1082
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.603
<v Speaker 2>mind that sideline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pressed eight to see if I get long </v>

1083
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:36.820
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that press seven,</v>

1084
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.970
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five for a fucking long business.</v>

1085
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I got the call my peoples in Jersey for </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes a piece,</v>

1086
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just figure out different things.</v>

1087
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Then they send you to a place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody Lucia and stripped down and you</v>

1088
00:58:55.871 --> 00:58:56.704
<v Speaker 2>got to go take a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you come out and they put a finger </v>

1089
00:58:58.661 --> 00:59:03.661
<v Speaker 2>up your ass to see if that's contraband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give you a tidy whities and orange,</v>

1090
00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.990
<v Speaker 2>like a rubber glove on and then loop </v>
<v Speaker 2>their finger up.</v>

1091
00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

1092
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:15.970
<v Speaker 2>You putting the finger up my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It breaks you down with a man as much as</v>

1093
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Speaker 2>anything in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first break.</v>

1094
00:59:17.601 --> 00:59:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1097
00:59:23.581 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to Esl and those guys there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and are very nice.</v>

1098
00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:29.810
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like the Boulder County </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail guys.</v>

1099
00:59:29.811 --> 00:59:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Those guys would shake your bed and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get up,</v>

1100
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 2>turn your light on in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and say,</v>

1101
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 2>get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a search at two in the</v>

1102
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:42.320
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are not nice at all.</v>

1103
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Then I got transferred to Summit County </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>

1104
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 2>which was a fucking paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paradise.</v>

1105
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:52.423
<v Speaker 2>Paralyze handball all day outside TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>till two in the morning using your cell </v>

1106
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 2>black and white tvs and yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic cable.</v>

1107
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.570
<v Speaker 2>You could be up all night if you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to breakfast,</v>

1108
01:00:06.571 --> 01:00:07.404

<v Speaker 2>not you could sleep through breakfast </v>

01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:10.754

<v Speaker 2>And then from there they shipped me off </v>

1110
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:17.480
<v Speaker 2>to the Department of corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's the nitty gritty.</v>

1111
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 2>You think black people talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie theater at night.</v>

1112
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't go there.</v>

1113
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 2>Don't go that black people talk all </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1114
01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.493

<v Speaker 1>I'm getting busted for this.</v>

1156
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.543
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of how I grew up around those </v>

1157
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what you do.</v>

1158
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Bratt cannot ask a woman the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same question.</v>

1159
01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>A woman could ask a woman,</v>

1160
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.003

1209
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.713
<v Speaker 2>but it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about when I was 21 and </v>

1210
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:43.594
<v Speaker 2>22 Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get stoned to the gills and go </v>

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:48.844
<v Speaker 2>to the Museum of Natural History of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>museum or my hobbies back then since I </v>

1212
01:05:53.111 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 2>was such a loan and then people looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1213
01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.293
<v Speaker 2>I was always a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go over the bridge to either go </v>

1214
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:02.680
<v Speaker 2>to one of those museums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I would sit in the courtroom,</v>

1215
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I would go to a place that had a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian sandwich and I get a bag of wise</v>

1216
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 2>potato chips in the 16 ounce coke and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to any court room.</v>

1217
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Court starts at seven at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metropolitan downtown.</v>

1218
01:06:17.111 --> 01:06:21.310

<v Speaker 3>like a pickup game with a sandwich and a</v>

1224
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:40.933
<v Speaker 3>soda and potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people don't realize </v>

1225
01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:45.410
<v Speaker 3>you could just go to court and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do that.</v>

1226
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.420
<v Speaker 3>12 people I would learn how to set back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you do that anytime you walk and you</v>

<v Speaker 3>you go.</v>

1253
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.000
<v Speaker 3>If you're running into the mall and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know there he is a spot on the card.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they pick you up the handcuffs here </v>

1260
01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:27.544
<v Speaker 2>and they put you in the side of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guide tells you this whole white </v>

1261
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 2>version of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pursuit started on.</v>

1262
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:37.391
<v Speaker 2>The vive wanted subject was moving and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high rate of speed.</v>

1263
01:08:39.111 --> 01:08:39.944
<v Speaker 2>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1264
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.280
<v Speaker 2>if I just had to chase you for 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pitched them my you.</v>

1265
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:44.643
<v Speaker 2>It puts you in the fucking trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put you in the back seat in front </v>

1266
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cameras take pictures and they put a</v>

1267
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:52.890
<v Speaker 2>cot next to you on the drive there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a couple back,</v>

1268
01:08:52.891 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 2>hands to your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1269
01:08:55.491 --> 01:08:58.910
<v Speaker 2>That you hit the steering wheel or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something a couple times.</v>

1270
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Then you go in there and you sit in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding tank and then you fucking.</v>

1271
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 2>If you're with one another person use </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just shut your fucking mouth.</v>

1272
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 2>You want to call your lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call them lead.</v>

1273
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:14.894
<v Speaker 2>They want to call your lawyer because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want one of the other guys to get a </v>

1274
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:21.360
<v Speaker 2>lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then like that you have to get a pub.</v>

1275
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:24.560
<v Speaker 2>It's conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So me,</v>

1276
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:25.394
<v Speaker 2>you and Jamie got arrested right now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to shut my mouth and tell you I'm </v>

1277
01:09:29.321 --> 01:09:30.154
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call my attorney later because I know </v>

1278
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 2>for a fact Jamie's going to get a public</v>
<v Speaker 2>defender.</v>

1279
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>So now I can't get a public defender </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's conflict of interest.</v>

1280
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 2>So the state has to pay for a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>attorney for me.</v>

1281
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.813
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of people don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got arrested with two or three </v>

1282
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:49.010
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep your mouth shut.</v>

1283
01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call my attorney later.</v>

1284
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.570
<v Speaker 2>You have an attorney?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1285
01:09:51.571 --> 01:09:52.404
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name.</v>

1286
01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:54.203
<v Speaker 2>Jamie cap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But public defender now to public </v>

1287
01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.244
<v Speaker 2>defenders can represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a better chance of getting a </v>

1288
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:05.970
<v Speaker 2>better attorney and the state pays for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1289
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.050
<v Speaker 2>So next time you pay for your mortgage </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>

1290
01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:10.220
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This state,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is because the jerk off like me </v>

01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:17.354
<v Speaker 2>fucking he wants $800 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though the state will give him a </v>

1294
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:22.850
<v Speaker 2>$400 an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like wholesale,</v>

1295
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.713
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I at least I got a better type of </v>

1296
01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:26.600
<v Speaker 2>attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You game the system,</v>

1297
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.523
<v Speaker 2>you game the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is fucking crazy how I love </v>

<v Speaker 2>You will do your writing things down </v>

1299
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:36.224
<v Speaker 2>like you wouldn't even think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just automatically started </v>

1300
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:39.590
<v Speaker 2>writing down numbers and percentages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1301
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this shit.</v>

1302
01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is like a sport.</v>

1303
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:48.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's what he'll do hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the time we bring on a rape case,</v>

1304
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 2>you got to go up there and we lived the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and tell the dates and there was a</v>

1305
01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:55.580
<v Speaker 2>rape kit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very fucking tough.</v>

1306
01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro.</v>

1307
01:10:58.580 --> 01:10:59.413
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing is anything he cops to </v>

1308
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gonna come back and I'm like oh Jay</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uhm,</v>

1310
01:11:06.951 --> 01:11:11.810

<v Speaker 2>Make them fucking super eight films down</v>

<v Speaker 2>there in Miramar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>

1312
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:15.123
<v Speaker 2>Wherever the fuck he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you see somebody get </v>

1313
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:22.140
<v Speaker 2>sued because they work the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying nothing bad yet.</v>

1314
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what your advisors and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around you Italia.</v>

1315
01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.213
<v Speaker 2>He uses hot water for the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>life because even if he gets that down </v>

1316
01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 2>to like an assault charge and he has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>serve eight months,</v>

1317
01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 2>12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really eight.</v>

1318
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Once he gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the civil suits are going to come at</v>

1319
01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:42.264
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1320
01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:43.483
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1321
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:44.543
<v Speaker 2>And then he has to pull an old jim moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Florida where they can't touch you </v>

1322
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 2>punch or some bullshit money at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1323
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:52.643
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1324
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:55.873
<v Speaker 6>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not unrelated to what we're </v>

1325
01:11:58.161 --> 01:12:01.100
<v Speaker 6>talking about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this has happened I think since we've</v>

1326
01:12:01.101 --> 01:12:01.934
<v Speaker 6>been live.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm Kevin Spacey uploaded this video on </v>

1327
01:12:04.671 --> 01:12:05.504
<v Speaker 6>his youtube channel where he's in </v>
<v Speaker 6>character as Frank Underwood and since </v>

1328
01:12:08.901 --> 01:12:09.734
<v Speaker 6>this has come out today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's now been indicted on rape charges </v>

1329
01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.340
<v Speaker 6>and Matt Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe.</v>

1330
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Felony rape charge.</v>

1331
01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:16.483
<v Speaker 6>So it's his plea to get his job back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This might have come out without him </v>

1332
01:12:20.001 --> 01:12:21.410
<v Speaker 6>knowing that was gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1333
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:22.283
<v Speaker 6>I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if you wanted to watch it and see </v>

1334
01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:25.340
<v Speaker 6>what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Should we watch it?</v>

1335
01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.730
<v Speaker 6>If it watching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to kickstart tube.</v>

1336
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:29.660
<v Speaker 6>It's fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ish.</v>

1337
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.180
<v Speaker 6>Ish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it should be definitely fair use.</v>

1338
01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.650
<v Speaker 6>We can always watch it minute or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that in a second seven.</v>

1339
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.970
<v Speaker 6>See what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's washing his hands.</v>

1340
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I know what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

1341
01:12:46.581 --> 01:12:49.700
<v Speaker 2>They may have tried to separate us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we have is too strong.</v>

1342
01:12:49.701 --> 01:12:51.550
<v Speaker 2>It's too powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mean.</v>

1343
01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.780
<v Speaker 2>After all we shared everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I,</v>

1344
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.303
<v Speaker 2>I told you my deepest darkest secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you exactly what people are </v>

1345
01:12:59.871 --> 01:13:03.470
<v Speaker 2>capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shocked you with my honesty,</v>

1346
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but mostly I challenged you and made you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think and you trusted me even though you</v>

1347
01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:15.320
<v Speaker 2>knew you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not done.</v>

1348
01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:20.321
<v Speaker 2>No matter what anyone says and besides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you want.</v>

1349
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.863
<v Speaker 2>You want me back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course she believed everything and </v>

1350
01:13:27.621 --> 01:13:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I've just been waiting with bated breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

1351
01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:30.514
<v Speaker 2>He confess at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just dying to have me declare </v>

1352
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:36.350
<v Speaker 2>that everything said is true and that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got what I deserved.</v>

1353
01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that be easy if it was all so </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple?</v>

1354
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Only you and I both know it's never that</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

1355
01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:44.714
<v Speaker 2>Not In politics and not in the live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't believe the worst with </v>

1356
01:13:47.851 --> 01:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1357
01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.550
<v Speaker 6>We'll see Karen characters 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be dead in the show.</v>

1358
01:13:52.551 --> 01:13:53.384
<v Speaker 6>Correct?</v>

1359
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that strange to watch?</v>

1360
01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.560
<v Speaker 6>It seems a little off his game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1361
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean it metal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

1362
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:07.510
<v Speaker 6>When I was playing Frank Underwood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he seems a little off like.</v>

1363
01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:09.790
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're a little tense on that one.</v>

1364
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.713
<v Speaker 6>Let's see.</v>

1365

<v Speaker 6>Fox News according to Fox News,</v>

1378
01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:48.964
<v Speaker 6>but this is where everywhere else too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He shared this video as he's announced </v>

1379

<v Speaker 6>that he's facing felony sexual assault </v>

<v Speaker 3>I really think to be that good at </v>

1385
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:23.150
<v Speaker 3>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be out of your fucking mind.</v>

1386
01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Spacey's bad mother Fucker when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to acting,</v>

1387
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:30.860
<v Speaker 3>all the horrible things he's done aside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

1388
01:15:30.861 --> 01:15:33.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a quality about someone that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that good,</v>

1389
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:35.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just got to like a certain </v>

1390
01:15:36.051 --> 01:15:40.430
<v Speaker 3>amount of insanity to be apologizing for</v>
<v Speaker 3>his actions.</v>

1391
01:15:40.431 --> 01:15:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Everything he did is horrendous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it means to be surprised that you're</v>

1392
01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:46.670
<v Speaker 3>seeing him seem crazy there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1393
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.350
<v Speaker 3>that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's too.</v>

1394
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.393
<v Speaker 3>He's too good to not be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I would assume that they're all </v>

1395
01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:53.120
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not crazy.</v>

1396
01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1397
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:55.330
<v Speaker 3>when someone is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1398

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to like Daniel Day Lewis doesn't </v>

01:15:58.401 --> 01:15:59.360
<v Speaker 3>seem to be crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1400
01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:02.540
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to be obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to be obsessed with work.</v>

1401
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.943
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of those brilliant </v>

1402
01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:11.100
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers are out of their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just his out of his mind as Germany.</v>

1403
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did when I was a kid.</v>

1404
01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.600
<v Speaker 3>My grandparents did.</v>

1405
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:17.550
<v Speaker 2>Shepherds are very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent dogs,</v>

1406
01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but they all have a cork know I record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1407
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:27.660
<v Speaker 2>my mom wouldn't Luda hers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a female bleed once a month,</v>

1408
01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 2>which made him even fucking crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I was a kid,</v>

1409
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:35.130
<v Speaker 2>my mom had one that you can go to next </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a purse,</v>

1410
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.030
<v Speaker 2>but buddy stink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had one of my buddies thinking he had</v>

1411
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.130
<v Speaker 2>a German shepherd that was pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic.</v>

1412
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You could walk in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a great time.</v>

1413
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I date and make a move for the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he built all our friends in the ass.</v>

1414
01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>He didn't like when people laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every one of them.</v>

1415
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 2>So every one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the extreme of what we do,</v>

1416
01:16:56.621 --> 01:17:00.250

<v Speaker 1>coppola to use a fake horse head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

1523
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:06.150
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like the</v>

1524
01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:06.983
<v Speaker 3>mockup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His scouts founder horse ready for </v>

1525
01:23:08.981 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 3>slaughter at a dog food plant in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jersey.</v>

<v Speaker 3>horse anyway.</v>

1531
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 3>That's probably better than not using </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1532
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>easiest way.</v>

1689
01:31:09.181 --> 01:31:10.014
<v Speaker 1>Like if you landed on general hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be in a general husband for 30 </v>

1692
01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:18.733
<v Speaker 1>People been on it for a long time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

1696
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.113
<v Speaker 5>There was a thing that happened in soap </v>
<v Speaker 5>operas and it happened while I was a </v>

1697
01:31:33.341 --> 01:31:34.174
<v Speaker 5>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Luke and laura transcended general </v>

1698
01:31:37.271 --> 01:31:41.200
<v Speaker 5>hospital and became a thing all </v>
<v Speaker 5>throughout the world.</v>

1699
01:31:41.230 --> 01:31:41.941
<v Speaker 5>There's people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1700
01:31:41.941 --> 01:31:42.774
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people didn't make sense because </v>

1701
01:31:44.741 --> 01:31:47.850
<v Speaker 5>the dude's hair was weird and strange </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple.</v>

1702
01:31:47.851 --> 01:31:49.840
<v Speaker 5>I did the scene with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were weird.</v>

1703
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:51.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did the sCene with him.</v>

1704
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:54.280
<v Speaker 5>She was a little too hot for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make a whole lot of sense,</v>

1705
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.353
<v Speaker 5>but it worked for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it caught fire culturally and became a </v>

1706
01:31:58.781 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 5>big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I</v>

1739
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:26.344
<v Speaker 3>on from 12 to one was a big time soap </v>
<v Speaker 3>opera and there was a bar in New York </v>

1740
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:33.970
<v Speaker 3>and there was a bar in New Jersey and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>

1741
01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 3>if you walked in there from 12 to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you said a word,</v>

1742
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.203
<v Speaker 3>somebody would tell you to shut the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and it was 98 percent men and they </v>

1743
01:33:44.651 --> 01:33:48.910
<v Speaker 3>would serve lunch and it was when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to was the midtown lounge,</v>

1744
01:33:48.911 --> 01:33:52.870
<v Speaker 3>but there was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a lunchtime soap opera that</v>

1745
01:33:52.871 --> 01:33:53.704
<v Speaker 3>men left ed jobs for construction guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would sit there and watch this </v>

1746
01:33:58.421 --> 01:34:01.480
<v Speaker 3>soap opera to tv's like it was a yankee </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1747
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they will go back to work.</v>

01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I have to get thiS train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

1749
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:09.880

<v Speaker 3>That was a thing.</v>

1750
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:12.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a big thing at one point and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>still remember,</v>

1751
01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you dated a girl and she stayed in on</v>

<v Speaker 3>wednesdays to watch dynasty bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stated on dynasty night if that </v>

1753
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.943

1758
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.540
<v Speaker 3>market for those kind of soap operas </v>

<v Speaker 1>All those guys were all coming up </v>
<v Speaker 1>together at that time in New York,</v>

1821
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>so it was a good bunch of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1822
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do remake a lot of fucking </v>

1823
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.760
<v Speaker 1>television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is fucking ridiculous thing.</v>

1824
01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:12.800
<v Speaker 1>They make so many shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it like.</v>

1825
01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Is it that hard to come up with a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>line of thought?</v>

1826
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:17.844
<v Speaker 1>like how many more va zombie shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna have to have a new zombie </v>

1827
01:38:20.641 --> 01:38:21.474
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1828
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I think they're making world war z as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>team in China,</v>

1829
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a walking dead in China now.</v>

1830
01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I Think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1831
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 1>that I think I know what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1832
01:38:33.721 --> 01:38:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Bad things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:37.560
<v Speaker 1>like you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were growing up.</v>

1834
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the fuck you grew up.</v>

1835
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.193
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say boston for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one fucking sandwich shop and </v>

1836
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:44.383
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to and guide because he made </v>
<v Speaker 1>you legit sandwich and all of a sudden </v>

1837
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.230
<v Speaker 1>another guy opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was cool,</v>

1838
01:38:52.231 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but now subway came and now the safeway </v>
<v Speaker 1>started making sandwiches,</v>

1839
01:38:56.401 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 1>so now nobody's making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with movies and tv.</v>

1840
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so much content we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't keep up with.</v>

1841
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:06.264
<v Speaker 1>It caN't keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't keep up with the amount of </v>

1842
01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:11.940
<v Speaker 1>content that's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you try to remake a show,</v>

1843
01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really make a ton of shit,</v>

1844
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but they forget the main element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the heart aspect of it.</v>

1845
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

<v Speaker 1>on amazon prime.</v>

1855
01:39:42.781 --> 01:39:43.614

1867
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:20.040

<v Speaker 1>but before you do that,</v>

1868
01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that extra step bothers the shit out of </v>

<v Speaker 1>the desert and they were making </v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000,000</v>

1893
01:41:47.051 --> 01:41:50.590

1895
01:41:54.311 --> 01:41:55.144

<v Speaker 1>but it's also really hard to test back </v>

1896
01:41:57.461 --> 01:42:02.461
<v Speaker 1>then and they weren't testing back </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing and strongest weed.</v>

1899
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:09.423
<v Speaker 1>Someone had explained to me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between strains that were </v>

1900
01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:17.000
<v Speaker 1>raised in Afghanistan and strains that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from other places.</v>

1901
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dean or friends from the store.</v>

1902

<v Speaker 1>So he denies that.</v>

1904
01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:26.014
<v Speaker 1>I guess the word they use is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word and he keeps trying to get that </v>

1905
01:42:29.621 --> 01:42:31.390
<v Speaker 1>seat,</v>

01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't bring pipe</v>

1934
01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 5>so I got to bring the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sent me.</v>

1935
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.350
<v Speaker 5>If I got to come down off the 11th floor</v>
<v Speaker 5>and walk two blocks,</v>

1936
01:43:57.351 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 5>I got to smoke the whole fuck of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>drawing,</v>

1937
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:01.280
<v Speaker 5>so I got to go back to my room and pass </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1938
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how strong the witness I </v>
<v Speaker 5>could just kills me.</v>

1939
01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Especially now that I'm not eating them </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore,</v>

1940
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:10.010
<v Speaker 5>just kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mama finds me.</v>

1941
01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:11.603
<v Speaker 5>I go back to the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I watched three episodes or somebody I </v>

1942
01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.960
<v Speaker 5>think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scientists making wheat now.</v>

1943
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got real botanists involved.</v>

1944
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:25.520
<v Speaker 5>There's money in it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that it's opening up in Canada,</v>

1945
01:44:25.521 --> 01:44:29.630
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be really weird because in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada they're making it legal,</v>

1946
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.010
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's legal now,</v>

1947
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.053
<v Speaker 5>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure rj reynolds is that who </v>

1948
01:44:34.131 --> 01:44:34.964
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just dumped a shit ton of money </v>

1949
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.213
<v Speaker 5>and to some marijuana production in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada that's going to file suit in the </v>

1950
01:44:40.461 --> 01:44:41.180
<v Speaker 5>United States.</v>

1951
01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:42.013
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's too much money involved in it </v>

1952
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:46.220
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to be good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to Be good for capitalism.</v>

1953
01:44:46.221 --> 01:44:47.054
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be good for people getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana as long as regular people </v>

1954
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:51.164
<v Speaker 5>could sell marijuana to let fucking rj </v>
<v Speaker 5>reynolds as long as they don't put some </v>

1955
01:44:55.491 --> 01:44:56.720
<v Speaker 5>restrictions like they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>put.</v>

1956
01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:57.873
<v Speaker 5>Was it you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie told me about what they were </v>

1957
01:44:58.551 --> 01:44:59.384
<v Speaker 5>trying to do in Ohio where they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to make it set up where you </v>

1958
01:45:01.791 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could grow weed,</v>

1959
01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 5>but only a couple companies could grow </v>
<v Speaker 5>it so that we would be legal,</v>

1960
01:45:06.951 --> 01:45:08.660
<v Speaker 5>but only a couple of companies would </v>
<v Speaker 5>monopolize.</v>

1961
01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:10.730
<v Speaker 5>And then everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this.</v>

1962
01:45:11.110 --> 01:45:13.760
<v Speaker 5>I ended up passing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that's terrible.</v>

1963
01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.790
<v Speaker 5>It's sad that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that mean that's such a corruption.</v>

1964
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.960
<v Speaker 5>That's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1965
01:45:17.961 --> 01:45:18.794
<v Speaker 5>you can have tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're the only ones who grow these </v>

1966
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:22.100
<v Speaker 5>tomatoes.</v>

1967
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 5>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a tomato.</v>

1968
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:24.913
<v Speaker 5>That's a law against nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying that nature can't take </v>

1969
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:27.884
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't put a seed in the ground and </v>

1970
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:30.950
<v Speaker 5>grow my own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

1971
01:45:30.951 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 5>Is it legal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's illegal.</v>

1972
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's it different than corn?</v>

1973
01:45:34.130 --> 01:45:35.360
<v Speaker 5>How's it different than a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1974
01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.420
<v Speaker 5>a pear tree?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

1975
01:45:37.421 --> 01:45:40.340
<v Speaker 5>it's a legal life form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a life form,</v>

1976
01:45:40.341 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to grow it,</v>

1977
01:45:42.090 --> 01:45:44.450
<v Speaker 5>and if you say can't grow it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got a corrupt system.</v>

1978
01:45:44.451 --> 01:45:45.284
<v Speaker 5>You got some bullshit law that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>weaseled in because you greased up some </v>

1979
01:45:48.981 --> 01:45:51.560
<v Speaker 5>assholes and the other people don't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>as much money as you do.</v>

1980
01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.533
<v Speaker 5>It's the only reason why that ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens or people are so desperate to </v>

1981
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:56.443
<v Speaker 5>get legal weed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they let some dickhead dominate the </v>

1982
01:45:59.001 --> 01:46:00.740
<v Speaker 5>entire industry?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some greedy.</v>

1983
01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1984
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 5>The deal is it's legal or it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>legal.</v>

1985
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise we're in some sort of a weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>dictatorship.</v>

1986
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:11.600
<v Speaker 5>You know this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just dEcide it's legal,</v>

1987
01:46:11.601 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 5>but you're the only one who gets to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

1988
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:14.900
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a plant.</v>

1989
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.883
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you owned all the pine trees </v>

1990
01:46:18.321 --> 01:46:21.740
<v Speaker 5>in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't make my country my pine trees.</v>

01:46:21.741 --> 01:46:23.300
<v Speaker 5>You want to buy pine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're buying it from me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I find you with a fucking christmas </v>
<v Speaker 5>tree.</v>

1993
01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:27.940

<v Speaker 5>It's crazy though.</v>

1994
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:31.100
<v Speaker 5>What happened last week?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1995
01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 5>New york who said he's wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>legalize weed.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants to make it recreationally.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Stupid to shoot down.</v>

1998
01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:40.430
<v Speaker 5>You should be making money off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It exists.</v>

1999
01:46:40.431 --> 01:46:42.350
<v Speaker 5>No matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're a capitalist,</v>

2000
01:46:42.351 --> 01:46:44.720
<v Speaker 5>if you're a person who believes in free </v>
<v Speaker 5>market,</v>

2001
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.510
<v Speaker 5>you already have whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you already have pills.</v>

2002
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.620
<v Speaker 5>People can get high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not so just.</v>

2003
01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.780
<v Speaker 5>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop with the child is arguments.</v>

2004
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Give the fucking people freedom and make</v>
<v Speaker 5>money off it.</v>

2005
01:46:54.661 --> 01:46:57.030
<v Speaker 5>You dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what everybody should be doing.</v>

2006
01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.290
<v Speaker 5>They should make it legal and profit off</v>
<v Speaker 5>of and they.</v>

2007
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:02.100
<v Speaker 5>It shouldn't stop with that either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She'd go to mushrooms,</v>

2008
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:04.470
<v Speaker 5>should go to a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should set up clinics,</v>

2009
01:47:04.690 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 5>set up places where people can go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through mushroom therapy.</v>

2010
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:09.210
<v Speaker 5>People that have suffered there coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>back from the war.</v>

2011
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know there's,</v>

2012
01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different bands for </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>

2013
01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:16.790
<v Speaker 5>People that are getting ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2014
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pass away.</v>

2015
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 5>They have extreme anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot that is alleviated by mushrooms.</v>

2016
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:23.663
<v Speaker 5>People that have gone through extensive </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer treatment and realize their </v>

2017
01:47:26.461 --> 01:47:27.294
<v Speaker 5>terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the best things for these people </v>

2018
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:29.904
<v Speaker 5>as mushrooms that helps them ease their </v>
<v Speaker 5>pain and suffering and their last dying </v>

2019
01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:34.434
<v Speaker 5>days and it doesn't seem to have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative effects other than the </v>

2020
01:47:37.501 --> 01:47:39.450
<v Speaker 5>occasional person losing their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>marbles,</v>

2021
01:47:39.451 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 5>which is going to happen no matter what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

2022
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:42.743
<v Speaker 5>It's something that should be studied </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's something that should be free </v>

2023
01:47:45.031 --> 01:47:47.250
<v Speaker 5>and it could benefit people so it should</v>
<v Speaker 5>be fucking legal.</v>

2024
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:52.550
<v Speaker 5>I think if everYbody modeled with </v>
<v Speaker 5>colorado's going peoples see it,</v>

2025
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:54.403
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of naysayers and just </v>

2026
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:56.634
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't understand that in Colorado </v>

2027
01:47:59.221 --> 01:48:01.740
<v Speaker 5>you get tax rebates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>

2028
01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:03.480
<v Speaker 5>colorado's real estate went through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking roof.</v>

2029
01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:05.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2030
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Speaker 5>this is something that I hope most </v>
<v Speaker 5>states go for.</v>

2031
01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.910
<v Speaker 5>I know that there's a backend angle to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2032
01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 5>It's a gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this,</v>

2033
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:16.200
<v Speaker 5>it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It depends what you do with it.</v>

2034
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:19.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd only argument is traffic fatalities.</v>

2035
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:24.380
<v Speaker 5>this the only argument and I we had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of increase in traffic fatalities,</v>

2036
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:30.380
<v Speaker 5>but what I've read is it depends on who </v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem is.</v>

2037
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to find the study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's absolutely correct.</v>

2038
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:34.703
<v Speaker 5>Some say there's been an increased,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some say the incurrence increase </v>

2039
01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:39.000
<v Speaker 5>corresponds to the population increase.</v>

2040
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.160
<v Speaker 5>I've read that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true,</v>

2041
01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.100
<v Speaker 5>but that kind of makes sense that if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get more people in the city,</v>

2042
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:45.890
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have more people </v>
<v Speaker 5>driving,</v>

2043
01:48:45.891 --> 01:48:47.570
<v Speaker 5>going to have more traffic accidents </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods.</v>

2044
01:48:47.571 --> 01:48:48.404
<v Speaker 5>So if the number just goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the population has increased by 14 </v>

2045
01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:54.030
<v Speaker 5>percent or whatever it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would kind of make sense.</v>

2046
01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:56.760
<v Speaker 5>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's be honest,</v>

2047
01:48:56.761 --> 01:48:57.594
<v Speaker 5>some people don't drive very well when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're high and if you're out there </v>

2048
01:48:59.911 --> 01:49:02.100
<v Speaker 5>driving high and space now and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking idiot,</v>

2049
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:05.040
<v Speaker 5>you might slam into a car that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>entirely possible too.</v>

2050
01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:07.440
<v Speaker 5>And to deny that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seem silly,</v>

2051
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 5>but I think that it's like everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>

2052
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:10.673
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are responsible </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and there's people that aren't </v>

2053
01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:13.403
<v Speaker 5>and there's people that are good drivers</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's people that aren't his </v>

2054
01:49:15.031 --> 01:49:15.864
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That drive is tracted as people that </v>

2055
01:49:16.861 --> 01:49:17.850
<v Speaker 5>don't pay attention to shit.</v>

2056
01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:19.530
<v Speaker 5>And then there's people that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know,</v>

2057
01:49:19.531 --> 01:49:23.250
<v Speaker 5>whether they're high or sober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would rather have you driving a lot of</v>

2058
01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:24.084
<v Speaker 5>people driving sober.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't fuck with your phone </v>

2059
01:49:25.621 --> 01:49:27.090
<v Speaker 5>when you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen you drive,</v>

<v Speaker 1>80.</v>

2131
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:11.263

<v Speaker 1>that means you're about to hit </v>

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.433
<v Speaker 1>while you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a rag or a tee shirt and get some </v>

2158
01:54:26.691 --> 01:54:27.524
<v Speaker 1>ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best wet rag with ice in it is </v>

2159
01:54:30.501 --> 01:54:31.334
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just rub it on your face real quick and </v>

2160
01:54:32.961 --> 01:54:33.794
<v Speaker 1>you wakes you right the fuck up and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasts for a few minutes and just do it </v>

2161
01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:36.644
<v Speaker 1>again a few minutes later and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine the whole way home if you can keep </v>

2162
01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:39.974
<v Speaker 1>ice and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2163
01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:42.830
<v Speaker 1>like a wash cloth or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with ice in it and it gets wet.</v>

2164
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:45.440
<v Speaker 1>JusT keep rubbing your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than anything.</v>

2165
01:54:45.441 --> 01:54:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I useD to smack myself in the face when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting up early in the morning to</v>

2166
01:54:49.041 --> 01:54:51.430
<v Speaker 1>do newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was delivering newspapers.</v>

2167
01:54:51.450 --> 01:54:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Then I would do gigs at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking tired,</v>

2168
01:54:54.171 --> 01:54:55.700
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be coming back,</v>

2169
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:56.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at midnight from thiS gig and I knew I </v>

2170
01:54:57.891 --> 01:54:58.724
<v Speaker 1>had to get up at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM to deliver newspapers depending upon </v>

2171
01:55:00.831 --> 01:55:01.664
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would just smack myself in the </v>

2172
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:05.780
<v Speaker 1>face because I was falling asleep at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>

2173
01:55:06.170 --> 01:55:07.003
<v Speaker 1>I would just feel my eyes getting heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm opening them up and I couldn't </v>

2174
01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:10.694
<v Speaker 1>keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking whack whack yourself in </v>

2175
01:55:12.771 --> 01:55:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts for like a couple of minutes.</v>

2176
01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:16.543
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gee,</v>

2177
01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole face would be stinging,</v>

2178
01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:20.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like seriously slap myself really </v>

2179
01:55:21.881 --> 01:55:25.790
<v Speaker 1>hard in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never fucking coffee guy.</v>

2180
01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Like as a kid I mangled and cuban coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight away from it.</v>

2181
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.713
<v Speaker 1>So when I first started triple runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have my kid at two in the </v>

2182
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:40.400
<v Speaker 1>afternoon on sunday and I would get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and boise,</v>

2183
01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Idaho at 1130 on</v>

2184
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:47.720
<v Speaker 2>my car would be filled with gas and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

2185
01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have four or five bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no dogs.</v>

2186
01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 2>And I would go to a gas station and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest mountain.</v>

2187
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Do they ever had an airline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would go for six hours.</v>

2188
01:55:59.131 --> 01:55:59.964
<v Speaker 2>I would eat no doz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the worst experiences I ever </v>

2189
01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.960
<v Speaker 2>had was I was falling asleep like I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>done and it was fucking 10 below zero,</v>

2190
01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.673
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I pulled over on the side of the </v>

2191
01:56:10.981 --> 01:56:13.440
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned my lights on,</v>

2192
01:56:13.590 --> 01:56:14.423
<v Speaker 2>I put the brake lights on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kicked the seat back and laid down </v>

2193
01:56:17.941 --> 01:56:20.190
<v Speaker 2>with the heat blasting and the car was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2194
01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And at one point sharon and I opened up </v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes and I thought I had lost control</v>

2195
01:56:26.501 --> 01:56:29.070
<v Speaker 2>of the call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In your mind,</v>

2196
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you feel like if I lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember holding onto the steering</v>

2197
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.084
<v Speaker 2>wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has my heart almost stopped and </v>

2198
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:36.800
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank god and get fucking hit here.</v>

2199
01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:41.520
<v Speaker 2>well that was a no dose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is way before red bull,</v>

2200
01:56:41.521 --> 01:56:43.110
<v Speaker 2>red bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that shit is.</v>

2201
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.450
<v Speaker 2>But I still remember doing coke all </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and shooting a short film fox.</v>

2202
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:53.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'll never forget the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave me two red bulls.</v>

2203
01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I drank two of them and I still fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep and I.</v>

2204
01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:57.110
<v Speaker 2>This is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go red bull.</v>

2205
01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:00.100
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is a red bull.</v>

2206
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking red bull onto dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it is,</v>

2207
01:57:08.011 --> 01:57:09.510
<v Speaker 2>John Jones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit that's going on.</v>

2208
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what's happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ufc is moving from vegas.</v>

2209
01:57:12.001 --> 01:57:15.600
<v Speaker 2>So this last night when I got home from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy store,</v>

2210
01:57:15.601 --> 01:57:16.560
<v Speaker 2>break it down for me.</v>

2211
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:19.890
<v Speaker 5>Jeff novitsky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on and break it down scientifically</v>

2212
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:22.140
<v Speaker 5>on thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people are calling bullshit,</v>

2213
01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:23.213
<v Speaker 5>including daniel.</v>

2214
01:57:24.130 --> 01:57:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I talked to call me on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2215
01:57:26.050 --> 01:57:28.780
<v Speaker 3>he tested positive again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you believe this shit?</v>

2216
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:31.810
<v Speaker 3>And they get a little fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out about it from cormay me.</v>

2217
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.760
<v Speaker 3>He told them they're going to move the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight to la.</v>

2218
01:57:33.761 --> 01:57:34.361
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2219
01:57:34.361 --> 01:57:35.021
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2220
01:57:35.021 --> 01:57:36.640
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that move With the fight down.</v>

2221
01:57:36.650 --> 01:57:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2222
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>this can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't seem real like I don't believe</v>

2223
01:57:42.371 --> 01:57:44.020
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked at his core age,</v>

2224
01:57:44.050 --> 01:57:49.050
<v Speaker 3>twitter and I said he tested positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and then I looked at when,</v>

2225
01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.510
<v Speaker 3>what this is like first thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning and he's like,</v>

2226
01:57:52.511 --> 01:57:55.240
<v Speaker 3>keep ti again again,</v>

2227
01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:56.373
<v Speaker 5>but from what I understand from reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ariel helwani is a transcript of his </v>

2228
01:58:01.571 --> 01:58:02.404
<v Speaker 5>interview with andy foster and hearing </v>
<v Speaker 5>what jeff novitsky has had to say about </v>

2229
01:58:07.451 --> 01:58:10.620
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it is is the numb the.</v>

2230
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:11.583
<v Speaker 5>The amount of it is so infinite decimal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's the exact same metabolite that </v>

2231
01:58:17.051 --> 01:58:17.884
<v Speaker 5>he had been screened for that he tested </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive for a year ago and that this </v>

2232
01:58:22.001 --> 01:58:27.001
<v Speaker 5>shit could stay in a system in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of sizes of the molecule.</v>

2233
01:58:27.341 --> 01:58:28.174
<v Speaker 5>It's like some $500,</v>
<v Speaker 5>million of a grain of sand or something </v>

2234
01:58:31.181 --> 01:58:35.270
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google what the actual number of the cow</v>

2235
01:58:35.271 --> 01:58:36.104
<v Speaker 5>small molecule is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so andy foster has said again this </v>

2236
01:58:41.411 --> 01:58:42.244
<v Speaker 5>transcription of this interview that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>did with ariel helwani that it's the </v>

2237
01:58:45.101 --> 01:58:45.934
<v Speaker 5>same metabolite for the same substance </v>
<v Speaker 5>they tested positive for that is as the </v>

2238
01:58:49.661 --> 01:58:50.494
<v Speaker 5>same instance that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number of it and it indicates that </v>

2239
01:58:55.241 --> 01:58:57.490
<v Speaker 5>this is something he's already been </v>
<v Speaker 5>punished for.</v>

2240
01:58:57.610 --> 01:58:58.443
<v Speaker 5>The same exact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's already gone through his steps and </v>

2241
01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 5>this is just an infant testimony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>small metaBolite.</v>

2242
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:06.543
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I would love to hear someone who </v>

2243
01:59:10.091 --> 01:59:10.924
<v Speaker 5>doesn't think that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thinks there might be some way to </v>

2244
01:59:13.631 --> 01:59:14.464
<v Speaker 5>game the system and the big thought that</v>
<v Speaker 5>people always bring up when it comes to </v>

2245
01:59:17.921 --> 01:59:21.220
<v Speaker 5>this stuff as micro dosing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone micro dosing like you're the one</v>

2246
01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:22.054
<v Speaker 5>who told me about that first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were telling me about a somebody </v>

2247
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Alex Rodriguez who is taking a gummy </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear testosterone and he was so he would</v>

2248
01:59:31.661 --> 01:59:34.900
<v Speaker 5>be up for the seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eighth and ninth inning,</v>

2249
01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:38.800
<v Speaker 5>but by the time the 10th and then came,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they tested him,</v>

2250
01:59:39.370 --> 01:59:43.780
<v Speaker 5>it would be out of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I would imagine the testing is better</v>

2251
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:46.900
<v Speaker 5>now and this is one of the things is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that novitsky wants to get into that.</v>

2252
01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:47.753
<v Speaker 5>The testing is far superior now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're able to piCk up these </v>

2253
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:53.770
<v Speaker 5>metabolites in much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much smaller quantities.</v>

2254
01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.820
<v Speaker 5>So this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this test is from december nine.</v>

2255
01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:58.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see what his tech here it is </v>

2256
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:01.533
<v Speaker 5>leading up to that apparently was </v>
<v Speaker 5>cleaned before that said we were </v>

2257
02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:05.464
<v Speaker 5>notified early this month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have an issue he has had over his most </v>

2258
02:00:07.691 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 5>recent tests were very small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

2259
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:13.950
<v Speaker 5>I'll pack describe how small it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A of a longterm,</v>

2260
02:00:13.951 --> 02:00:18.951
<v Speaker 5>a tablet substance called d h empty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>known as oral terryn Nepal trendable,</v>

2261
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.800
<v Speaker 5>which is the reason for his most recent </v>
<v Speaker 5>suspension a year and a half ago.</v>

2262
02:00:24.801 --> 02:00:26.500
<v Speaker 5>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very small amounT.</v>

2263
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:27.980
<v Speaker 5>But there was a number that.</v>

2264
02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.400
<v Speaker 5>Where does it say the number?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was an ak rife or.</v>

2265
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:35.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like how much smaller.</v>

2266
02:00:35.951 --> 02:00:38.440
<v Speaker 5>It isn't a grain of rice is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can't find it.</v>

2267
02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2268
02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:42.513
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2269
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I get how everybody would be fuck and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pissed.</v>

2270
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:50.350
<v Speaker 5>I get how everybody would think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a cheater.</v>

2271
02:00:50.351 --> 02:00:53.470
<v Speaker 5>He's cheating again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get the you would think that,</v>

2272
02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:57.040
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if that's true and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not true,</v>

2273
02:00:57.070 --> 02:00:57.903
<v Speaker 5>it would be ashamed to accuse him of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it is the same stuff that was in his </v>

2274
02:01:02.171 --> 02:01:05.230
<v Speaker 5>system that was ruled to be from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tainted supplement.</v>

2275
02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pickle is 1000000000000th of a gram.</v>

2276
02:01:10.781 --> 02:01:11.614
<v Speaker 5>Novitsky said if you put one grain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt on the table and split it up into </v>

2277
02:01:15.461 --> 02:01:18.680
<v Speaker 5>$50 million pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pickle.</v>

2278
02:01:18.681 --> 02:01:22.120
<v Speaker 5>Graham is one of those pieces of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>gram of salt,</v>

2279
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:23.643
<v Speaker 5>which is insane.</v>

2280
02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:27.840
<v Speaker 5>so that grain of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a $50,</v>

2281
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:29.590
<v Speaker 5>million times larger or smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2282
02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.110
<v Speaker 5>It's crAzy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's very,</v>

2283
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:31.571
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2284
02:01:31.571 --> 02:01:36.130
<v Speaker 5>very small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if this is true and they believe it's</v>

2285
02:01:36.131 --> 02:01:36.964
<v Speaker 5>true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the guy who runs California state </v>

2286
02:01:38.501 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 5>athletic commission,</v>
<v Speaker 5>andy foster,</v>

2287
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I have a great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great deal.</v>

2288
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.420
<v Speaker 5>Tremendous amount of respect for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy.</v>

2289
02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Very proactive with weight cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very proactive with weight classes,</v>

2290
02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:51.350
<v Speaker 5>very proactive with a lot of the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's really good.</v>

2291
02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:52.573
<v Speaker 5>If he believes that this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientifically been proven to be from </v>

2292
02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:58.670
<v Speaker 5>the same exact thing that he already </v>
<v Speaker 5>been punished for,</v>

2293
02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 5>I agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just that that guy knows what the fuck</v>

2294
02:02:02.361 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 5>he's talking about and he's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as novitsky.</v>

2295
02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:07.130
<v Speaker 5>So are these people that are all saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's legit.</v>

2296
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:08.383
<v Speaker 5>Here's the question though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have other people been still punished </v>

2297
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:18.050
<v Speaker 5>for the exact same crime?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have other people tested positive?</v>

2298
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:18.883
<v Speaker 5>Again for the exact same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This I do not know and I don't know if </v>

2299
02:02:22.461 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 5>people are looking into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there is any preferential treatment,</v>

2300
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 5>that would be where the argument would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

2301
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:30.080
<v Speaker 5>Preferential treatment is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>tainted.</v>

2302
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:30.914
<v Speaker 5>Supplements are legItimate problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean novitsky showed us hundreds and </v>

2303
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of supplements you could buy at</v>
<v Speaker 5>any store that has,</v>

2304
02:02:39.190 --> 02:02:40.023
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamins and muscle builders and all </v>

2305
02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:44.990
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of things that test positive</v>
<v Speaker 5>for steroids.</v>

2306
02:02:44.991 --> 02:02:47.030
<v Speaker 5>There's a shit ton of them out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2307
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:49.750
<v Speaker 5>You can get a lot of stuff in these </v>
<v Speaker 5>systems.</v>

2308
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:52.640
<v Speaker 5>But then there's also people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking steroids.</v>

2309
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:55.600
<v Speaker 5>So how do you know who the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find out who's,</v>

2310
02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:56.690
<v Speaker 5>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take shit,</v>

2311
02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:57.733
<v Speaker 5>don't take anything unless it's third </v>
<v Speaker 5>party tests that don't take anything </v>

2312
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 5>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't take anything squirrely.</v>

2313
02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes people do and it's fucked </v>
<v Speaker 5>up that you know,</v>

2314
02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:08.330
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mayBe they lack a supplement,</v>

2315
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:11.450
<v Speaker 5>maybe they've had good results with it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they get one bad batch.</v>

2316
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:14.780
<v Speaker 5>That's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to know that this was from</v>

2317
02:03:14.781 --> 02:03:15.614
<v Speaker 5>December 9th.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what the levels of that </v>

2318
02:03:18.351 --> 02:03:23.351
<v Speaker 5>drug they found where before the summer </v>
<v Speaker 5>night it takes a long time ago.</v>

2319
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Well I understand so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every time your urine,</v>

2320
02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:29.300
<v Speaker 5>the level should get lower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lower,</v>

2321
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:30.263
<v Speaker 5>lower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what they're saying is this is </v>

2322
02:03:32.361 --> 02:03:33.194
<v Speaker 5>the lowest detectable number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's no lower than they should </v>

2323
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:40.220
<v Speaker 5>have found this before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not higher.</v>

2324
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe not.</v>

2325
02:03:41.451 --> 02:03:44.820
<v Speaker 5>Depending on the city is numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way it's been explained to me,</v>

2326
02:03:44.821 --> 02:03:46.370
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a fucking scientist,</v>

2327
02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:47.503
<v Speaker 5>but the way it's been explained to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>this number is so small that it could </v>

2328
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:54.230
<v Speaker 5>conceivably be tested in one test and </v>
<v Speaker 5>not tested another test.</v>

2329
02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 5>And then also as the testing procedures </v>
<v Speaker 5>get more and more thorough,</v>

2330
02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.593
<v Speaker 5>they get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're detecting things they couldn't </v>

2331
02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:02.264
<v Speaker 5>detect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even just a year ago I gets </v>

2332
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.490
<v Speaker 5>continued.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the technology is continuing to grow</v>

2333
02:04:07.670 --> 02:04:11.090
<v Speaker 5>and they're getting much better at </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding how to use it and how to.</v>

2334
02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:11.973
<v Speaker 5>How to advance it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not as simple as you test </v>

2335
02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:17.930
<v Speaker 5>positive a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you test negative today like they.</v>

2336
02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:18.813
<v Speaker 5>They might have better methods of </v>
<v Speaker 5>detection today than they had a year </v>

2337
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:23.090
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got arrested today.</v>

2338
02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 5>Joel judge is going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joe rogan,</v>

2339
02:04:26.481 --> 02:04:27.314
<v Speaker 5>I'm released on bail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the da wants you to take a urine </v>

2340
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:33.350
<v Speaker 5>test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Samples come back dirty.</v>

2341
02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 5>The first year was free.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know who joe is going to go</v>

2342
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.500
<v Speaker 2>in there and you're thc levels are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be off the chain.</v>

2343
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:43.950
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be off the chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be up to chain.</v>

2344
02:04:44.490 --> 02:04:45.323
<v Speaker 2>When they come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to coin and they don't </v>

2345
02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 2>know joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what it was.</v>

2346
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:50.184
<v Speaker 2>Now this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next time we test you behind in 26 </v>

2347
02:04:55.441 --> 02:04:59.280
<v Speaker 2>percent because we know you're using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is in 1997.</v>

2348
02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:00.253
<v Speaker 2>The lady told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know if you use that and I stayed </v>

2349
02:05:03.811 --> 02:05:05.760
<v Speaker 2>through the program and I went down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2350
02:05:05.761 --> 02:05:06.331
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2351
02:05:06.331 --> 02:05:07.164
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I joined the voluntary group </v>

2352
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:15.200
<v Speaker 2>and my buddy sent me an eighth of weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember smoking a joint and going</v>

2353
02:05:15.481 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 2>back and the guys like dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you smoke a joint before you came in</v>

2354
02:05:19.951 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>for the test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like levels.</v>

2355
02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:28.670
<v Speaker 5>ThIs is I'm telling you about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is</v>

2356
02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:29.653
<v Speaker 2>funny joke and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to see the test before the </v>

2357
02:05:32.631 --> 02:05:36.440
<v Speaker 2>ninth and I want to see the test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most recent test,</v>

2358
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:38.510
<v Speaker 2>those levels had to go down.</v>

2359
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:39.663
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand what you're saying to us </v>

2360
02:05:41.290 --> 02:05:42.340
<v Speaker 5>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

2361
02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Unless he did the steroid during non </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition season,</v>

2362
02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.380
<v Speaker 2>which they're allowed to do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2363
02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:50.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not.</v>

2364
02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:52.360
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They never know what they know.</v>

2365
02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:55.390
<v Speaker 5>They can never take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a banned list of things they can</v>

2366
02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:58.630
<v Speaker 5>never ever have in their system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say if you're up fighting,</v>

2367
02:05:58.960 --> 02:05:59.860
<v Speaker 5>they'll still test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

2368
02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:02.500
<v Speaker 5>Say if you don't have a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not in camp,</v>

2369
02:06:02.501 --> 02:06:05.980
<v Speaker 5>you don't have a bout lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They still still tested joey diaz.</v>

2370
02:06:05.981 --> 02:06:07.570
<v Speaker 5>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on in the bathroom.</v>

2371
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:08.583
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get some get some fluids </v>
<v Speaker 5>from you now I don't know if they using </v>

2372
02:06:11.110 --> 02:06:15.880
<v Speaker 5>just urine or if urine and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure what the protocol,</v>

2373
02:06:15.881 --> 02:06:16.714
<v Speaker 5>but I do know that it's very thorough </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're catching people for things </v>

2374
02:06:19.361 --> 02:06:21.130
<v Speaker 5>that they would have never caught them </v>
<v Speaker 5>for in the past,</v>

2375
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:24.010
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of the things about this</v>
<v Speaker 5>test.</v>

2376
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:28.030
<v Speaker 5>It could possibly be as it's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>explained to me that this,</v>

2377
02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:28.883
<v Speaker 5>this number is so fucking small that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they might not even been able to detect </v>

2378
02:06:33.551 --> 02:06:37.090
<v Speaker 5>it a year ago at this number,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this insanely small number.</v>

2379
02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:38.043
<v Speaker 5>There's new levels of detection now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas he would be completely negative </v>

2380
02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:45.910
<v Speaker 5>x amount of time in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they can test it and they could find</v>

2381
02:06:45.911 --> 02:06:50.890
<v Speaker 5>that insanely 50 million of a grain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt size particle.</v>

2382
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:51.743
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so fucking small that they weren't </v>

2383
02:06:53.711 --> 02:06:57.160
<v Speaker 5>able to catch something like that x </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of time in the past,</v>

2384
02:06:57.161 --> 02:06:57.994
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a year ago or two years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now they can and then the future </v>

2385
02:06:59.801 --> 02:07:00.634
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be even better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to keep getting better at </v>

2386
02:07:01.841 --> 02:07:03.460
<v Speaker 5>this stuff as they advanced the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

2387
02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:05.710
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as it's been explained to me,</v>

2388
02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:06.603
<v Speaker 5>what you're seeing heRe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're seeing here is not evidence </v>

2389
02:07:08.951 --> 02:07:09.784
<v Speaker 5>of new drug use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's evidence that the testing is far </v>

2390
02:07:13.001 --> 02:07:17.260
<v Speaker 5>better and that he has the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 5>metabolite anD he definitely did have it</v>

2391
02:07:17.261 --> 02:07:20.780
<v Speaker 5>in the system because they're finding it</v>
<v Speaker 5>a year later in these te,</v>

2392
02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:21.471
<v Speaker 5>te,</v>
<v Speaker 5>te,</v>

2393
02:07:21.471 --> 02:07:22.600
<v Speaker 5>te,</v>
<v Speaker 5>te tiny amount.</v>

2394
02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:24.100
<v Speaker 5>His body hasn't completely gotten rid of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it yet.</v>

2395
02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.133
<v Speaker 5>Still in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is how long has that stuff </v>

2396
02:07:26.981 --> 02:07:30.760
<v Speaker 5>stays in your system?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've said through normal detection,</v>

2397
02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:33.700
<v Speaker 5>I believe google this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure this is correct,</v>

2398
02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 5>but through normal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's not?</v>

2399
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:40.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean from whatever the time they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wrote this stuff out.</v>

2400
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe they were saying it can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>detected up to 18 months,</v>

2401
02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:45.453
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as this technology gets better and they </v>

2402
02:07:47.621 --> 02:07:49.930
<v Speaker 5>can detect smaller and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 5>particles,</v>

2403
02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 5>it's potentially possible that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>might extend.</v>

2404
02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:53.913
<v Speaker 5>So you might not just be 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be 19 or 20 or who knows how </v>

2405
02:07:56.861 --> 02:07:58.450
<v Speaker 5>long it takes for your body to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that shit.</v>

2406
02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:02.350
<v Speaker 2>The other guys like columbia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gustafson and guys,</v>

2407
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:03.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look at this is where there's </v>

2408
02:08:06.101 --> 02:08:07.080
<v Speaker 2>smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's fire.</v>

2409
02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2410
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:10.630
<v Speaker 2>and they have a point to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a point though,</v>

2411
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:15.631
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not mad at them for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of the show of John Jones.</v>

2412
02:08:15.730 --> 02:08:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am too.</v>

2413
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:21.270
<v Speaker 2>For what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him to death and I saw him at the</v>

2414
02:08:21.271 --> 02:08:23.500
<v Speaker 2>albuquerque game show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We lacked.</v>

2415
02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to think anymore.</v>

2416
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to think.</v>

2417
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.720
<v Speaker 2>This one really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2418
02:08:34.570 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and I feel bad at you and I both know </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the card of the year.</v>

2419
02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:40.123
<v Speaker 2>It's a phenoMenal cause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The card when peOple fly in and then </v>

2420
02:08:43.871 --> 02:08:47.440
<v Speaker 2>make plans around that and they do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of stuff around it.</v>

2421
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what this is like for them.</v>

2422
02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>They just lost this saturday night </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

2423
02:08:53.670 --> 02:08:54.503
<v Speaker 5>Well in vegas it takes a big hit too </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this was going to be taking </v>

2424
02:08:57.091 --> 02:08:57.924
<v Speaker 5>place in vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those people are going to be in </v>

2425
02:08:58.711 --> 02:08:59.544
<v Speaker 5>town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be a tremendous amount of </v>

2426
02:09:00.781 --> 02:09:04.680
<v Speaker 5>money for the casinos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it was a lot of money for them.</v>

2427
02:09:04.681 --> 02:09:07.560
<v Speaker 5>There is a big thing to have there and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger arena,</v>

2428
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:10.290
<v Speaker 5>so they're moving it to the forum which </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a smaller place.</v>

2429
02:09:10.710 --> 02:09:11.970
<v Speaker 5>The foreman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inglewood is,</v>

2430
02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:15.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much smaller it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tb mobile arena,</v>

2431
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:16.263
<v Speaker 6>but he said he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dana was saying he could make about </v>

2432
02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:19.774
<v Speaker 6>$6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the gate at and t mobile arena and </v>

2433
02:09:21.401 --> 02:09:23.470
<v Speaker 6>he's going to be lucky to make a million</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the forum.</v>

2434
02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.500
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2435
02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:26.553
<v Speaker 5>it's different prices to in vegas and </v>
<v Speaker 5>also the fact that it's such short </v>

2436
02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:29.603
<v Speaker 5>timing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what they do with the </v>

2437
02:09:30.481 --> 02:09:32.610
<v Speaker 5>original tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how it works.</v>

2438
02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.060
<v Speaker 5>This is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The very first ufc I ever did,</v>

2439
02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.460
<v Speaker 5>the very first ufc ever work was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>dothan,</v>

2440
02:09:38.461 --> 02:09:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ufc 12,</v>

2441
02:09:40.050 --> 02:09:41.430
<v Speaker 5>but was supposed to be in New York </v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

2442
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:43.620
<v Speaker 5>They cAncelled It in New York state that</v>
<v Speaker 5>would let them do it.</v>

2443
02:09:43.621 --> 02:09:44.290
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2444
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:47.400
<v Speaker 5>they switched the whole thing overnight </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to dothan,</v>

2445
02:09:47.401 --> 02:09:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Alabama wouldn't take one of them </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicopter plane</v>

2446
02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.470
<v Speaker 5>and flying a fucking dope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was weird.</v>

2447
02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:56.030
<v Speaker 5>It was weird back then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2448
02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.673
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2449
02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:00.980
<v Speaker 5>that's the only time I've ever heard of </v>
<v Speaker 5>something changing this close to.</v>

2450
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:03.170
<v Speaker 5>That was one day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is one week.</v>

2451
02:10:03.171 --> 02:10:05.240
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard of an event changing </v>
<v Speaker 5>like this before.</v>

2452
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:09.080
<v Speaker 5>Not that I can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck is happening.</v>

2453
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:12.410
<v Speaker 5>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they seem very confident that you're</v>

2454
02:10:12.411 --> 02:10:15.830
<v Speaker 5>not dealing with someone who's taking a </v>
<v Speaker 5>drug.</v>

2455
02:10:15.831 --> 02:10:16.664
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with the very same drug </v>

2456
02:10:18.531 --> 02:10:19.364
<v Speaker 5>that he took x amount of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still in a system the drug has already </v>

2457
02:10:23.031 --> 02:10:26.330
<v Speaker 5>been punished for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that people get mad,</v>

2458
02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:28.040
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2459
02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.720
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to accuse someone of </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that they're not really guilty</v>

2460
02:10:32.721 --> 02:10:33.554
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely guilty of taking it the </v>

2461
02:10:34.851 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 5>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are accusing them of being stupid</v>

2462
02:10:38.151 --> 02:10:41.180
<v Speaker 5>and taking it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's true.</v>

2463
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:46.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know for a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm reading from actual experts</v>

2464
02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:50.480
<v Speaker 5>leads me to believe that they're making </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense,</v>

2465
02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:53.023
<v Speaker 5>but I would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to talk to someone who </v>

2466
02:10:54.441 --> 02:10:55.274
<v Speaker 5>disagrees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows more about it than me to </v>

2467
02:10:56.571 --> 02:10:59.060
<v Speaker 5>really form an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my opinion is like,</v>

2468
02:10:59.061 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had to Bet,</v>

2469
02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:02.150
<v Speaker 5>I would say he probably didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>

2470
02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:03.313
<v Speaker 5>but I would like to talk to someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's like a real fucking expert who </v>

2471
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:09.290
<v Speaker 5>could break down exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process is,</v>

2472
02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:10.124
<v Speaker 5>who can tell you if it is even possible </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this could be from another </v>

2473
02:11:13.431 --> 02:11:14.700
<v Speaker 5>ingestion somewhere along.</v>

2474
02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.433
<v Speaker 1>The sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad thing about this whole situation is </v>

2475
02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:25.860
<v Speaker 1>what they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really from the bottom was a great card.</v>

2476
02:11:26.610 --> 02:11:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great car.</v>

2477
02:11:27.361 --> 02:11:30.720

<v Speaker 1>nobody even talks about it.</v>

2478
02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned bj penn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2609
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:50.670
<v Speaker 5>It's just stupid that in this case it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>this case.</v>

2610
02:17:50.671 --> 02:17:52.940
<v Speaker 5>It's approximate their own vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2611
02:17:52.941 --> 02:17:57.090
<v Speaker 5>that's a with emergency meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's save vegas.</v>

2612
02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.510
<v Speaker 5>The tourism board of vegas must be </v>
<v Speaker 5>steaming.</v>

2613
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:01.380
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Ask this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>google this.</v>

2615
02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:03.773
<v Speaker 5>Find out who's disputing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If anybody dispute if anybody makes any </v>

2616
02:18:07.351 --> 02:18:09.510
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's a scientist or something like</v>

2617
02:18:09.511 --> 02:18:13.430
<v Speaker 5>that who says that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 5>microdosing or that it did.</v>

2618
02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:14.573
<v Speaker 5>What the California state athletic </v>
<v Speaker 5>commissions understanding of it is not </v>

2619
02:18:18.121 --> 02:18:18.954
<v Speaker 5>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out if there's anYbody that </v>

2620
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:24.270
<v Speaker 5>has written anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm upset.</v>

2621
02:18:24.330 --> 02:18:27.900
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted this fight to take place </v>
<v Speaker 5>without any bullshit behind it.</v>

2622
02:18:27.930 --> 02:18:29.910
<v Speaker 5>I just want it to be a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

2623
02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:30.953
<v Speaker 5>It's an amazing matchup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think gustafson especially against </v>

2624
02:18:33.841 --> 02:18:35.370
<v Speaker 5>glover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to share has never looked better.</v>

2625
02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.560
<v Speaker 5>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's long as john.</v>

2626
02:18:37.561 --> 02:18:38.394
<v Speaker 5>He's got crazy footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the first guy to ever take jon </v>

2627
02:18:41.491 --> 02:18:42.324
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a fucking tough fight regardless </v>

2628
02:18:44.671 --> 02:18:46.360
<v Speaker 5>of whether or not john prepared much for</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2629
02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:50.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he did prepare as good as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could have a gustafson's better,</v>

2630
02:18:50.491 --> 02:18:52.590
<v Speaker 5>I think than he was when that fight took</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

2631
02:18:52.591 --> 02:18:56.310
<v Speaker 5>I really do think he's better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking phenomenal.</v>

2632
02:18:56.370 --> 02:18:57.203
<v Speaker 5>it's an amazing fight and john's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be so motivated to try to get </v>

2633
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:02.340
<v Speaker 5>stripped away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets tripped.</v>

2634
02:19:02.341 --> 02:19:03.174
<v Speaker 5>All the different things that he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked up to have a chance of </v>

2635
02:19:05.341 --> 02:19:07.110
<v Speaker 5>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be so motivated,</v>

2636
02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:10.020
<v Speaker 5>but you also have to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible amount of pressure.</v>

2637
02:19:10.021 --> 02:19:11.010
<v Speaker 5>He's going to be under two.</v>

2638
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:14.340
<v Speaker 5>Historically though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy who shines under pressure,</v>

2639
02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:17.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean stop shogun and it's first title </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight when he was,</v>

2640
02:19:17.491 --> 02:19:19.050
<v Speaker 5>what was he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty two or something like thAt.</v>

2641
02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.193
<v Speaker 5>He's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John's always been good at fighting top </v>

2642
02:19:23.641 --> 02:19:25.800
<v Speaker 5>level competition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>good at handling the stress,</v>

2643
02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:28.670
<v Speaker 5>but this is you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a different kind of stress.</v>

2644
02:19:28.671 --> 02:19:30.080
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucked up stress.</v>

2645
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:32.000
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a big fight.</v>

2646
02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:33.193
<v Speaker 5>This is a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus I fucked up and everybody knows I </v>

2647
02:19:35.511 --> 02:19:38.780
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and this is not even the </v>
<v Speaker 5>current fuck up.</v>

2648
02:19:38.781 --> 02:19:42.080
<v Speaker 5>It's reminding him over the past fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's the other stuff,</v>

2649
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:44.840
<v Speaker 5>the car accident and all the other crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

2650
02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:49.430
<v Speaker 5>All of it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but He has an opportunity at redemption.</v>

2651
02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:53.720
<v Speaker 5>It's just when you know how much is on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the line because he's undefeated,</v>

2652
02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:55.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Except for matt hamill fight,</v>

2653
02:19:55.731 --> 02:19:59.650
<v Speaker 5>which we know he was destroying hamill </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was disqualified.</v>

2654
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't a real loss like somebody beat </v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

2655
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.760
<v Speaker 5>He's beaten everybody that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>unprecedented outside of khabib number.</v>

2656
02:20:05.761 --> 02:20:07.370
<v Speaker 5>go ahead off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody beats everybody.</v>

2657
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:08.353
<v Speaker 5>John's beaten everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's going to be a certain amount </v>

2658
02:20:09.951 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 5>of people that are looking forWard for </v>
<v Speaker 5>him to fail and he feels that too.</v>

2659
02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:15.260
<v Speaker 5>So a lot going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2660
02:20:15.261 --> 02:20:18.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot going on in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And gustafson is fucking good.</v>

2661
02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 5>You received a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knocked out clover to cheryl with.</v>

2662
02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like some video game shit man.</v>

2663
02:20:25.430 --> 02:20:28.280
<v Speaker 5>It was like he was in mortal kombat was </v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous.</v>

2664
02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:29.233
<v Speaker 5>His footwork,</v>

2665
02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.600
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>not just a way,</v>

2844
02:30:08.421 --> 02:30:09.254
<v Speaker 3>like a boss employee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was talking to me in a way where I </v>

2845
02:30:12.261 --> 02:30:14.990
<v Speaker 3>was going to have to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never,</v>

2872
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:23.023
<v Speaker 5>taking things out and fixing things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy lived there and he had a </v>

2873
02:31:24.841 --> 02:31:25.674
<v Speaker 5>mountain dew jug filled with malt liquor</v>

2939
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:31.330
<v Speaker 2>want a union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They felt like the union guys,</v>

2940
02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:33.340
<v Speaker 2>they had it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

2941
02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:36.510
<v Speaker 2>it was too expensive and people didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to know,</v>

2942
02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.600

<v Speaker 3>They don't have shit in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get a really cheap car.</v>

3056
02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:56.000
<v Speaker 3>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pickup truck.</v>

3057
02:39:56.001 --> 02:39:57.370
<v Speaker 3>No radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

3058
02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:00.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that baffles me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to fucking get the Idaho.</v>

3059
02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:02.990
<v Speaker 3>How about the fucking guy killed his </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole family.</v>

3060
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:05.750
<v Speaker 3>How about that guy got kIlled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wife killed his kids.</v>

3061
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:09.510
<v Speaker 3>You hear about that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck jesus christ,</v>

3062
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:12.920
<v Speaker 3>and he looked so normally you see a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of him and as mr came,</v>

3063
02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.080
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

3064
02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:15.960
<v Speaker 1>mrs heyman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you look at him,</v>

3065
02:40:15.961 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the picture him with his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>

3066
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that guy looks so fucking far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of killing his own kid.</v>

3067
02:40:21.390 --> 02:40:22.223
<v Speaker 1>How is he capable of killing his wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people out there that </v>

3068
02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:26.233
<v Speaker 1>just fucking broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're broken and you and if you're a </v>

3069
02:40:29.281 --> 02:40:30.660
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about that.</v>

3070
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:32.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

3071
02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:33.293
<v Speaker 1>That's the bIggest difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest difference is women have to </v>

3072
02:40:36.391 --> 02:40:37.224
<v Speaker 1>constantly be in fear of a violent man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas men rarely are in fear of a </v>

3073
02:40:41.611 --> 02:40:43.260
<v Speaker 1>violent woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it doesn't happen.</v>

3074
02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It happened to my friend phil hartman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife shot him while he was asleep.</v>

3075
02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:48.960
<v Speaker 1>That did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority,</v>

3076
02:40:48.961 --> 02:40:49.794
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at the numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are afraid of the opposite </v>

3077
02:40:52.681 --> 02:40:54.270
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's women that are afraid of men.</v>

3078
02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:55.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a different environment.</v>

3079
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different dynamic.</v>

3080
02:40:57.810 --> 02:41:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not like anything that we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever really,</v>

3081
02:41:00.001 --> 02:41:00.834
<v Speaker 1>truly appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know how to handle yourself in </v>

3082
02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:05.430
<v Speaker 1>that case that happened in Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he killed,</v>

3083
02:41:05.431 --> 02:41:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Is there any past the best of violence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3084
02:41:08.730 --> 02:41:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just snapped one day,</v>

3085
02:41:10.831 --> 02:41:11.664
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense that this guy </v>

3086
02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:15.180
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3087
02:41:15.181 --> 02:41:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that flows you off is her</v>
<v Speaker 1>car folded.</v>

3088
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.823
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which meant he had to take her right </v>

3089
02:41:23.041 --> 02:41:25.090
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive to Idaho,</v>

3090
02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:26.003
<v Speaker 1>which has to be 11 to 12 hours and drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>back 770 miles away and drive back </v>

3091
02:41:33.661 --> 02:41:34.494
<v Speaker 1>without nobody noticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible gas station </v>

3092
02:41:37.021 --> 02:41:40.770
<v Speaker 1>attendants recognizing a truck with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child in the back.</v>

3093
02:41:41.250 --> 02:41:42.083
<v Speaker 1>You know they have to do a search of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every gas station camera to see if he </v>

3094
02:41:46.531 --> 02:41:48.120
<v Speaker 1>pulled up and they didn't find him.</v>

3095
02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:49.153
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they've even gone that </v>

3096
02:41:51.481 --> 02:41:52.314
<v Speaker 1>deep so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got to figure out our cell </v>

3097
02:41:55.081 --> 02:42:00.081
<v Speaker 1>phone ended up fucking mailbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand where people get</v>

3098
02:42:00.901 --> 02:42:05.901
<v Speaker 1>the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so tough.</v>

3099
02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.190
<v Speaker 1>The ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>

3100
02:42:08.210 --> 02:42:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between cell phones,</v>

3101
02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:14.910
<v Speaker 1>drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cam pictures.</v>

3102
02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Think about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

3103
02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:20.040
<v Speaker 1>How they find that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

3104
02:42:20.250 --> 02:42:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's way more difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

3105
02:42:21.751 --> 02:42:24.930
<v Speaker 1>But a rural area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural areas,</v>

3106
02:42:24.931 --> 02:42:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you can still get away with the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3107
02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:27.393
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3108
02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Look at that chick that was jogging from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the university of whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It didn't stiffen up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was in another country,</v>

3168
02:45:36.841 --> 02:45:37.674
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like olivia,</v>

3169
02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:38.873
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I paid more than I've ever played in my </v>

3170
02:45:39.451 --> 02:45:43.200
<v Speaker 3>life right now actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That got my blood done recently.</v>

3171
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Got everything checked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's groovy,</v>

3172
02:45:44.851 --> 02:45:48.330
<v Speaker 3>but I was dehydrated so I've been making</v>
<v Speaker 3>a point to drink more water.</v>

3173
02:45:50.010 --> 02:45:52.230
<v Speaker 3>What if I keep myself d hide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>

3174
02:45:52.231 --> 02:45:53.064
<v Speaker 3>Could I drink during the show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I want if I do that subconsciously </v>

3175
02:45:55.231 --> 02:45:58.260
<v Speaker 3>to limit my needing to pee during three </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour conversations.</v>

3176
02:45:58.470 --> 02:46:00.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so either.</v>

3177
02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:05.500
<v Speaker 3>I drink water all fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I won't go to the dentist.</v>

3178
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:08.580
<v Speaker 3>A doctor for a physical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always says,</v>

3179
02:46:08.581 --> 02:46:09.820
<v Speaker 3>drink more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You die.</v>

3180
02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:10.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3181
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:12.110
<v Speaker 1>he used to always just drink more water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hurt.</v>

3182
02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3183
02:46:12.970 --> 02:46:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I sleep with water next to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is big d,</v>

3184
02:46:16.430 --> 02:46:19.190
<v Speaker 1>get up and have a sip of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get up pee,</v>

3185
02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:20.173
<v Speaker 1>drink a fucking gown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water because of the sleep apnea </v>

3186
02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:26.630
<v Speaker 1>machines to put a fluid in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3187
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I just bring a bottle of water with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>next door,</v>

3188
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:30.883
<v Speaker 1>right to the bedroom at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important if you read </v>

3189
02:46:33.261 --> 02:46:34.094
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason.</v>

3190
02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:35.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3191
02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:38.210
<v Speaker 1>because when you're over 50 you pee </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

3192
02:46:38.930 --> 02:46:39.763
<v Speaker 1>but there's a rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look it up when you're by </v>

3193
02:46:41.751 --> 02:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>yourself next time in the hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why you should sleep.</v>

3194
02:46:45.980 --> 02:46:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Diet hydrated when you're over 50 big </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why.</v>

3195
02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I can,</v>

3196
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:54.610
<v Speaker 1>whenever I gO to yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like,</v>

3197
02:46:54.611 --> 02:46:55.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to make a conscious effort to </v>

3198
02:46:57.621 --> 02:47:00.800
<v Speaker 1>take that fluid back in because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat so much.</v>

3199
02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:01.633
<v Speaker 1>One of those hot yoga classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't make a real like </v>

3200
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:06.140
<v Speaker 1>conscious drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thirsty,</v>

3201
02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:07.213
<v Speaker 1>you got to make kind of a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to get those fluids back in your </v>

3202
02:47:09.201 --> 02:47:10.034
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you probably should take some </v>

3203
02:47:10.371 --> 02:47:13.420
<v Speaker 1>electrolytes to some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrolytes up.</v>

3204

<v Speaker 1>I just blast the fucking banana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I blast to bananas.</v>

3206
02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:21.770

<v Speaker 1>you eat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you work.</v>

3210
02:47:29.930 --> 02:47:31.430
<v Speaker 1>No pump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no calories,</v>

3211
02:47:31.431 --> 02:47:34.060

02:47:37.491 --> 02:47:38.324
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all that's just going to kill </v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking people 20 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monster energy and all those energy </v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't kill people on.</v>

3216
02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.010
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing is just coffee before </v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of workout.</v>

3217
02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:53.233
<v Speaker 1>Just coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that before I go to the </v>

3218
02:47:55.251 --> 02:47:57.490
<v Speaker 1>store?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3219
02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>before I go to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd drink a four express shots.</v>

3220
02:48:05.050 --> 02:48:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I usually drink one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either shameless plug,</v>

3221
02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:10.880
<v Speaker 1>caveman nitros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even my wife ago.</v>

3222
02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:16.100
<v Speaker 1>How big is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I put that cancer sugar in there and</v>

3223
02:48:18.381 --> 02:48:21.740
<v Speaker 1>I fucking get sugar free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar saccharin again,</v>

3224
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that fucking call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>

3225
02:48:23.361 --> 02:48:24.194
<v Speaker 1>music is sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just me and four cups of express </v>

3226
02:48:27.601 --> 02:48:28.434
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's going through my </v>

3227
02:48:28.941 --> 02:48:30.950
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have the ball,</v>

3228
02:48:30.951 --> 02:48:31.784
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I take a toke off the pipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to cook the espresso upper level </v>

3229
02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and I pop a nicotine gum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

3230
02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:39.393
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm juiced up by the time I get to the </v>

3231
02:48:40.971 --> 02:48:44.370
<v Speaker 1>comedy store because that's when I put </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself through the nicotine.</v>

3232
02:48:44.420 --> 02:48:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Nicotine guM is supposed to be legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like from what I understand,</v>

3233
02:48:47.511 --> 02:48:50.690
<v Speaker 1>nicotine itself is a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>nootropic.</v>

3234
02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:51.613
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've analyzed the cognitive benefits </v>

3235
02:48:53.571 --> 02:48:55.880
<v Speaker 1>of nicotine on its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's addictive.</v>

3236
02:48:55.881 --> 02:48:56.714
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nicotine gum is very healthy for </v>

3237
02:48:58.941 --> 02:48:59.774
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there was a way it giVes you a </v>

3238
02:49:00.291 --> 02:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3239
02:49:00.970 --> 02:49:05.970
<v Speaker 1>If there was a way to blast nicotine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe chew it like a tobacco,</v>

3240
02:49:06.831 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>like a clean tobacco.</v>

3241
02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Just to give you a little push off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cliff.</v>

3242
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not bad for you.</v>

3243
02:49:13.621 --> 02:49:16.230
<v Speaker 2>I remember one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that it really shocked</v>

3244
02:49:16.231 --> 02:49:18.930
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cops were looking for me,</v>

3245
02:49:18.931 --> 02:49:19.764
<v Speaker 2>so I jumped on a bus in san francisco in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1985 and I didn't even know the buses </v>

3246
02:49:23.881 --> 02:49:28.881
<v Speaker 2>going was going to a place called reno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never heard of the marina and when</v>

3247
02:49:29.391 --> 02:49:30.224
<v Speaker 2>those days you could smoke on a bus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>met a kids from whatever Egypt and he </v>

3248
02:49:35.311 --> 02:49:38.820
<v Speaker 2>smoked with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that time I was never touched tobacco</v>

3249
02:49:38.821 --> 02:49:41.550
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never even consider it.</v>

3250
02:49:41.551 --> 02:49:45.240
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'm cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigars were the worst thing in the world</v>

3251
02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:46.074
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember we smoked a joint with </v>

3252
02:49:48.991 --> 02:49:51.720
<v Speaker 2>hash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We end tobacco in it.</v>

3253
02:49:52.350 --> 02:49:53.740
<v Speaker 2>We Thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

3254
02:49:54.090 --> 02:49:56.460
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 85.</v>

3255
02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:59.430
<v Speaker 2>We smoked a joint on a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3256
02:49:59.430 --> 02:50:04.250
<v Speaker 2>My lungs were going to fucking cave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the tobacco and the hash east,</v>

3257
02:50:04.350 --> 02:50:09.350
<v Speaker 2>because the problem with ashes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you smoke hash,</v>

3258
02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:13.730
<v Speaker 2>it doubles in your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean it?</v>

3259
02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:17.430
<v Speaker 2>The smoke doubles in your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it do that?</v>

3260
02:50:17.770 --> 02:50:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look like johnny fucking scientists.</v>

3261
02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Next time we'll have these smart guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes on this show as well.</v>

3262
02:50:26.210 --> 02:50:28.320
<v Speaker 2>I usually smoke hash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a pen.</v>

3263
02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:32.160
<v Speaker 2>You know those pens that people put </v>
<v Speaker 2>jewelry on fire,</v>

3264
02:50:32.250 --> 02:50:36.630
<v Speaker 2>put it under glass and put it under a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glass and you smoke it clean because the</v>

3265
02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:37.513
<v Speaker 2>way that we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That straight the ash and there was </v>

3266
02:50:41.011 --> 02:50:44.400
<v Speaker 2>something else with double up in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking lungs.</v>

3267
02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.590
<v Speaker 2>That's why you call so hard.</v>

3268
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:49.330
<v Speaker 3>I remember when it expands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expands,</v>

3269
02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:51.670
<v Speaker 3>expands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was a super square,</v>

3270
02:50:51.671 --> 02:50:53.350
<v Speaker 3>I never did any drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never smoked pot,</v>

3271
02:50:53.351 --> 02:50:55.670
<v Speaker 3>never did anything and I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an a,</v>

3272
02:50:55.700 --> 02:50:58.240
<v Speaker 3>an agent's room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're in montreal.</v>

3273
02:50:58.270 --> 02:50:59.103
<v Speaker 3>It was me and my manager and this agent </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a friend of ours and he had a </v>

3274
02:51:03.251 --> 02:51:07.780
<v Speaker 3>piece of hash that he lit on like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thumbtack under glass.</v>

3275
02:51:07.781 --> 02:51:10.220
<v Speaker 3>He blows and it blows on it and he puts </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lid on it.</v>

3276
02:51:10.221 --> 02:51:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching him and then he smokes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hash out of it and I was like,</v>

3277
02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:15.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm seeing this guy do </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

3278
02:51:15.730 --> 02:51:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like a scene in hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out here.</v>

3279
02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:21.540
<v Speaker 3>He's doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's smoking drugs like says hash.</v>

3280
02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:24.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what I thought of hash that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking movie midnight express.</v>

3281
02:51:24.491 --> 02:51:25.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

3282
02:51:25.421 --> 02:51:26.254
<v Speaker 3>you gotta go to jail for life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to jerk off on the glass </v>

3283
02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:30.190
<v Speaker 3>like you're gonna have to fight someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill them.</v>

3284
02:51:30.670 --> 02:51:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Midnight express is about smoking hash </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Turkey.</v>

3285
02:51:33.570 --> 02:51:34.403
<v Speaker 3>That's in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hash was a serious fucking drug like </v>

3286
02:51:38.081 --> 02:51:40.510
<v Speaker 3>this guy was doing heroin like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing hash.</v>

3287
02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:41.860
<v Speaker 3>You might as well be doing heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3288
02:51:41.861 --> 02:51:43.300
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe she's doing this in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of me.</v>

3289
02:51:46.450 --> 02:51:47.283
<v Speaker 3>Smoking hash and front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people with a glass scares the fuck </v>

3290
02:51:49.841 --> 02:51:50.674
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a for someone who doesn't do </v>

3291
02:51:52.331 --> 02:51:55.060
<v Speaker 3>anything like that's a big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hit of a joint.</v>

3292
02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:56.380
<v Speaker 3>He took a hit of a joint and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3293
02:51:56.381 --> 02:51:58.210
<v Speaker 3>god likes to smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that before.</v>

3294
02:51:58.810 --> 02:52:03.810
<v Speaker 3>You light a piece of hash and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a thumb tack and put it under that glass</v>

3295
02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:06.250
<v Speaker 3>and get there and suck it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>glass.</v>

3296
02:52:06.251 --> 02:52:07.084
<v Speaker 3>You creaTe a drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your speech sniffing and exhaust fume </v>

3297
02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:12.730
<v Speaker 3>the fuck are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know anything about me,</v>

3298
02:52:12.731 --> 02:52:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you know I've seen some people do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs shit.</v>

3299
02:52:15.810 --> 02:52:16.643
<v Speaker 3>When I was in New York and when I got up</v>
<v Speaker 3>early and there's a movie called sugar </v>

3300
02:52:19.121 --> 02:52:20.340
<v Speaker 3>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want sugar hill.</v>

3301
02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Sugar hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the sugarhill gang related.</v>

3302
02:52:25.300 --> 02:52:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Sugar hill is a movie that is possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>wesley snipes.</v>

3303
02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:30.513
<v Speaker 3>Best movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was when they were the drug </v>

3304
02:52:33.791 --> 02:52:36.080
<v Speaker 3>dealers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drug dealers can.</v>

3305
02:52:36.190 --> 02:52:39.040
<v Speaker 3>the alexander opens up the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3306
02:52:39.041 --> 02:52:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Because she plays the mother and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them oldeR belt and he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Make me hold the belt mama,</v>

3308
02:52:44.831 --> 02:52:47.080
<v Speaker 3>because you're the oldest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold the belts.</v>

3309
02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I could shoot this goddamn Maryland </v>
<v Speaker 3>mama's sick.</v>

3310
02:52:49.570 --> 02:52:50.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3311
02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:53.860
<v Speaker 3>This is his best movie by fucking fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a good movie.</v>

3312
02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta wrap this up.</v>

3313
02:52:56.740 --> 02:52:59.800
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do it how we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to kick open the new year?</v>

3314
02:53:00.370 --> 02:53:02.120
<v Speaker 3>We didn't lay a bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

3315
02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Nothing about fucking John Jones </v>
<v Speaker 3>gusteson.</v>

3316
02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:09.120
<v Speaker 3>If he had a better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't give me a breakdown here that</v>

3317
02:53:09.130 --> 02:53:10.890
<v Speaker 3>John Jones versus gustafson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3318
02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:11.793
<v Speaker 3>I'm stuck on both fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I want to tell people that I </v>

3319
02:53:14.681 --> 02:53:16.820
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't bet me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can bet either.</v>

3320
02:53:17.470 --> 02:53:19.120
<v Speaker 3>They're both very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matchups,</v>

3321
02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:20.710
<v Speaker 3>very good mattress sideboard.</v>

3322
02:53:20.710 --> 02:53:23.110
<v Speaker 3>You have to give her an advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's so much bigger and because</v>

3323
02:53:23.111 --> 02:53:26.290
<v Speaker 3>she just doesn't seem to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just smashing people.</v>

3324
02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:27.543
<v Speaker 3>She's got really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good technique and she's super </v>

3325
02:53:30.551 --> 02:53:33.970
<v Speaker 3>powerful and she's really big and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a lot of success.</v>

3326
02:53:34.660 --> 02:53:35.493
<v Speaker 3>And then amanda is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is without a doubt the hardest hitting </v>

3327
02:53:37.730 --> 02:53:38.990
<v Speaker 3>bantamweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking cool.</v>

3328
02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:42.150
<v Speaker 3>SMash her man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has a gate camp.</v>

3329
02:53:42.250 --> 02:53:46.400
<v Speaker 3>She's long shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She keeps people in the end,</v>

3330
02:53:46.401 --> 02:53:47.430
<v Speaker 3>the punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll.</v>

3331
02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:49.020
<v Speaker 3>She's gonna test sideboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3332
02:53:49.140 --> 02:53:49.973
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find out whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>she could hurt her and then we find out </v>

3333
02:53:52.270 --> 02:53:54.100
<v Speaker 3>if she could hurt her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kid get crazy.</v>

3334
02:53:54.370 --> 02:53:55.930
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows because Amanda Nunez </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

3335
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:59.230
<v Speaker 3>If she hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cyborg can get crazy,</v>

3336
02:53:59.231 --> 02:54:02.320
<v Speaker 3>but if she can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hits harder than holly.</v>

3337
02:54:02.321 --> 02:54:03.154
<v Speaker 3>I think in my humble opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think holly is a great kicker and </v>

3338
02:54:06.911 --> 02:54:08.110
<v Speaker 3>holly is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3339
02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:09.333
<v Speaker 3>she's really good at movement and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very durable and a holly managed to go </v>

3340
02:54:12.641 --> 02:54:14.380
<v Speaker 3>the full distance with cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3341
02:54:14.470 --> 02:54:15.460
<v Speaker 3>it was a hard fight.</v>

3342
02:54:15.490 --> 02:54:17.110
<v Speaker 3>It was a hard fight and she lost that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3343
02:54:17.710 --> 02:54:18.543
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3344
02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:19.493
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between holly and Amanda </v>

3345
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:22.503
<v Speaker 3>Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like one shot power is </v>

3346
02:54:24.221 --> 02:54:26.840
<v Speaker 3>better for nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

3347
02:54:26.860 --> 02:54:29.110
<v Speaker 3>holly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she fought germane to me,</v>

3348
02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:31.110
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she fought jermaine,</v>

3349
02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:34.160
<v Speaker 3>she knocked her down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knocked her down,</v>

3350
02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:35.980
<v Speaker 3>a straight left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She hurt her,</v>

3351
02:54:36.010 --> 02:54:37.810
<v Speaker 3>she heard her a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had kicked her.</v>

3352
02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:38.793
<v Speaker 3>She hit her with a question Mark kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and had kicked her and germane to </v>

3353
02:54:40.991 --> 02:54:42.310
<v Speaker 3>random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is really good,</v>

3354
02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:44.770
<v Speaker 3>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy duty moy thai fighter,</v>

3355
02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.260
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't want to fight cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holly did sidebar.</v>

3356
02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Just the biggest and the best in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like,</v>

3357
02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:51.603
<v Speaker 3>you look at our success ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at the way she beats girls </v>

3358
02:54:54.041 --> 02:54:55.300
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's so powerful,</v>

3359
02:54:55.301 --> 02:54:56.134
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that amanda is the toughest fight for </v>

3360
02:54:58.010 --> 02:54:58.930
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

3361
02:54:58.931 --> 02:54:59.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

3362
02:54:59.501 --> 02:55:02.350
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to cyborgs,</v>

3363
02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:03.980
<v Speaker 3>fight with gina carano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gina</v>

3364
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:05.930
<v Speaker 5>carano one point in time was on top of </v>
<v Speaker 5>her on the ground.</v>

3365
02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:10.040
<v Speaker 5>She didn't sustain it and she lost the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight and cyborg eventually smashed her.</v>

3366
02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:12.980
<v Speaker 5>But gina had her moments in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3367
02:55:12.981 --> 02:55:13.814
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think gina was ever the one shot </v>

3368
02:55:15.651 --> 02:55:17.870
<v Speaker 5>cracker that amanda is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

3369
02:55:17.871 --> 02:55:19.790
<v Speaker 5>cyborg is way better than she was back </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

3370
02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.070
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so was amanda.</v>

3371
02:55:22.071 --> 02:55:22.850
<v Speaker 5>Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3372
02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:24.350
<v Speaker 5>coming off of their cal pennington </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>

3373
02:55:24.351 --> 02:55:25.184
<v Speaker 5>you watched that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She dominated raquel pennington and I </v>

3374
02:55:27.381 --> 02:55:29.540
<v Speaker 5>think we're one of the toughest girls in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the division.</v>

3375
02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:31.860
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's a hard woman and she,</v>

3376
02:55:31.980 --> 02:55:34.250
<v Speaker 5>she beats a lot of really good fighters </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she,</v>

3377
02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:35.113
<v Speaker 5>she gave holly holm all she could handle</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then got a split decision loss to </v>

3378
02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:43.550
<v Speaker 5>holly holm in holly's debut in the ufc </v>
<v Speaker 5>and she's fucking good.</v>

3379
02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:46.460
<v Speaker 5>And Amanda Nunez handled her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was very,</v>

3380
02:55:46.461 --> 02:55:47.240
<v Speaker 5>very impressive.</v>

3381
02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:49.780
<v Speaker 5>Who scary like dismantling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's beating her up.</v>

3382
02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:50.633
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

3383
02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:52.790
<v Speaker 5>like she's on another level now as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>champion.</v>

3384
02:55:52.791 --> 02:55:55.010
<v Speaker 5>She's gotten even better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was always really good.</v>

3385
02:55:55.250 --> 02:55:57.860
<v Speaker 5>she was always really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as a champion,</v>

3386
02:55:57.861 --> 02:56:00.830
<v Speaker 5>she got even better when she beat ronda </v>
<v Speaker 5>rousey and 48 seconds.</v>

3387
02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:04.070
<v Speaker 5>That was the big coming out party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like here we are baby.</v>

3388
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:06.530
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's the best bantam weight ever,</v>

3389
02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:07.693
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of her ability to knock girls </v>

3390
02:56:09.651 --> 02:56:11.630
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she's the scariest of all time.</v>

3391
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:13.250
<v Speaker 5>She's the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3392
02:56:13.430 --> 02:56:16.220
<v Speaker 5>sidebar can't make 1:35.</v>
