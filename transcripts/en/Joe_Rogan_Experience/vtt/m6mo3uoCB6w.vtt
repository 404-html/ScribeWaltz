00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you see them shifting off of</v>

2
00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I was on an oil platform in between Iran</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iraq and the middle of nowhere on</v>

4
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the ocean now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a mile long platform,</v>

5
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>half American marines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half Iraqi soldiers.</v>

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And we're teaching the Iraqis how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard their oil.</v>

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

8
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iraqi barracks,</v>

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I got to tour them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so nice.</v>

10
00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Like those dudes were shooting off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the platform.</v>

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the fish that we're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit they would fish those fish and</v>

12
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>then eat the fish.</v>

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A</v>

14
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>lot of filth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Thursday.</v>

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

16
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's just negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda man.</v>

17
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Love Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the American say.</v>

18
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>That</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent fact</v>

19
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime for</v>

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Shady Kagan</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty though where mattresses were all</v>

21
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.981
<v Speaker 1>brown and brody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give a shit like we do about it</v>

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>because they don't give a shit or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the money.</v>

23
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we were,</v>

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>we were training them and providing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with supplies.</v>

25
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>So at the time they did have access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

26
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>like we gave them a bunch of water</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles and we're like,</v>

27
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.261
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put this,</v>

28
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was all over.</v>

29
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They will throw the water bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just all over the floor as opposed</v>

30
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>to like putting them in the refrigerator</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Americans had provided.</v>

31
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:32.361
<v Speaker 1>So probably like really dissing chanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>country got conquered.</v>

32
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Everyone they know get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

33
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.100

<v Speaker 1>why are you telling me how to do my</v>

34
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:40.230

35
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>react to just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like example of what we do to another.</v>

36
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>You could see it south the north to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>south and people call you a Yankee.</v>

37
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>People call me Yankees before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worse than a Yankee Dude.</v>

38
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm a foreigner because my family came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other countries.</v>

39
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't here when your bullshit was</v>

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:05.710

<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

42
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>But I remember this and I was on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil platform.</v>

43

<v Speaker 1>They had this thing where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation win hearts and minds and this</v>

44
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the craziest thing ever.</v>

45
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Will just fuck the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>

47
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>So once a week they had ice cream</v>
<v Speaker 1>socials with the Iraqis and they would</v>

48
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:35.091
<v Speaker 1>fucking find a way to get tubs of rocky</v>
<v Speaker 1>road ice cream airlifted onto this oil</v>

49
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>platform and then we would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be having ice cream with the</v>

50
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Iraqis so that they would see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing our American rocky road.</v>

58
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:00.680
<v Speaker 1>in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was worth it because this</v>

59
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>is</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

63
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>The candy room a is a toothpick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fish or vampire fish?</v>

64
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>A species of parasitic freshwater</v>
<v Speaker 1>catfish.</v>

65
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>A native to the Amazon basin where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>found in countries of Bolivia,</v>

66
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>

67
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Peru.</v>

68
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>swims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

70
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>The smaller species are known for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to invade alleged tendency to</v>

71
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>invade parasites and parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human urethra.</v>

72
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite ethnological reports dating back</v>

73
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>to the late 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first documented case of the removal</v>

74
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>of the candy room from a human urethra</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not occur until 1997,</v>

75
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and even that incident has remained a</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of controversy.</v>

76
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So it might be bullshit did they might</v>
<v Speaker 1>have anal catfish.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dick?</v>

79
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want it to my shifts.</v>

80
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>That could definitely get into vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this might totally be bullshit.</v>

85
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Historical accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest published reports of this Ken</v>

86
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>dirus attacking human host comes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German biologist,</v>

00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>CFP Vonda Marty s in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29 who never actually observed it,</v>

88
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>but rather was told about it by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>natives of the area,</v>

89
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.711
<v Speaker 1>including that men would tie a ligature</v>
<v Speaker 1>around their penis going into the river.</v>

90
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Vendors were happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that meant?</v>

91
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 1>That meant dudes where they had cock</v>
<v Speaker 1>rings on and they got busted and then.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I totally believe it.</v>

98
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:56.400
