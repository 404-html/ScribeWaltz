<v Speaker 1>but the waves with look at that,</v>

22
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>they have the fucking stock of twitter right there,</v>

23
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>plus zero,</v>

27
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>stalk at the stock number right next to it.</v>

28
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.380

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>this is unintentionally incendiary statement that Wilson says he made directly</v>

34
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>to troll trump's followers.</v>

35
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>February's trolling everybody.</v>

36
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

42
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting is that in order to intentionally make people angry,</v>

43
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Wilson targeted anime Geeks as his insult.</v>

44
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to find the first person in your group,</v>

272
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>

273

<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

274
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to think that he's got arbitrarily gonna always kill the</v>

275
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.471
<v Speaker 1>weakest person.</v>

276
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it's going to get to know one because there's going to be the next</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're weak or you're not weak.</v>

280
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to do that,</v>

281
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>that person would have to be either a terrible person who is victimizing other</v>

282
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:10.990
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

283
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

284
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Or they would have to have attacked first.</v>

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be.</v>

286
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Or they would have been such a piece of shit that people are rooting for you.</v>

287
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody that was real chatty and you just ask them did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

294
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Especially if like he fucks up some hunting parties.</v>

295
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You're out there with sneaking up on a pig and he's like,</v>

296
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.311
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

297
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>it's so hot out.</v>

298
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pig runs away.</v>

299
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's hungry.</v>

300
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Chatty with you.</v>

302
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>The first man I think about that kind of stuff,</v>

303
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>like if a plane crashed,</v>

304
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I already know I'm planning ahead did I'd eat a Vietnamese guy?</v>

305
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

306
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Because it's easier to start or move.</v>

307
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>If you attack somebody bigger,</v>

308
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you eat somebody bigger in front of other people.</v>

309
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It's going to alarm people,</v>

310
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but you got to eat a small person,</v>

311
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>so stature is important.</v>

312
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I think if you come down a viet,</v>

313
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to be that upset at you.</v>

314
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Other Vietnamese people are going to be super upset.</v>

315
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.694
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about,</v>

316
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>dad?</v>

317
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Their sacrifice.</v>

318
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>They're more understanding of things,</v>

319
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:12.630
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

320
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>this is the character you're playing.</v>

321
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.143
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

322
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you eat a black dude,</v>

323
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you eat a black lady and her family's there.</v>

324
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>There are going to be pissed.</v>

325
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>So you think at Vietnamese person,</v>

326
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.334
<v Speaker 1>we'll let you slide.</v>

327
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that they'd be much more forgiving over a couple of day period.</v>

328
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of their relatives.</v>

329
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so honestly.</v>

330
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.713
<v Speaker 1>One thing?</v>

331
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

332
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

333
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that be super pissed at you.</v>

334
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Especially modernized ones,</v>

335
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>but what is interesting is like Vietnam is one of the few places where Americans</v>

336
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>can go back to Vietnam and they don't seem to hold any grudge at all.</v>

337
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.143
<v Speaker 1>Exhibit a</v>

338
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.271
<v Speaker 1>exhibit a man.</v>

339
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
