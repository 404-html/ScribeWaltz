1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three stories.</v>

2
00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you set up a perimeter around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

3
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Key people stationed in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns at the windows looking out</v>

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be,</v>

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>we take the building down and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do a massive construction projects</v>

7
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a combat zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these army engineers,</v>

8
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>God bless them all would roll down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their bulldozers and there they'd</v>

9
00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>put these big concrete barriers up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put sand bags and all the windows</v>

10
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and they build machine gun nests on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

11
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this in the middle of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem.</v>

12
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd have this secure combat</v>

13
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>outpost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while they were doing that,</v>

14
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of was our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our addition to this type of operation</v>

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>was while they were doing this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction progress project,</v>

16
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>obviously the situation was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable for the American forces.</v>

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And so what we would do is I would push</v>
<v Speaker 1>our seals out into perimeter buildings</v>

18
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that were maybe a 200 or 300 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when the enemy would come to</v>

19
00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd kill them.</v>

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy scene that must've been to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be taking these buildings and then</v>

21
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing them and turning them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>military bases and then one after</v>

22
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>another as you're doing this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

24
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it was an awesome effort and I think a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good number.</v>

25
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We put in one combat outpost and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

26
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>army engineers put in 30,000 sandbags in</v>

27
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>one combat outpost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three buildings.</v>

28
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Just all good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of sand out there.</v>

29
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

30
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

31
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And so how many buildings did you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind up taking overall?</v>

32
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

33
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It probably a total of like 10 combat</v>
<v Speaker 1>outposts.</v>

34
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Each one having two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four buildings.</v>

35
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me clarify when I say we,</v>

36
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about this massive effort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one one aed,</v>

37
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the First Brigade,</v>

38
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>First Armored Division and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>battalions that were underneath them,</v>

39
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>including one a Marine Corps battalion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm pointing that out,</v>

40
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

41
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42

<v Speaker 1>those guys were just unbelievable us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like war.</v>

43
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>They were awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You choked up.</v>

44
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were,</v>

46
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>these guys were awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really were.</v>

47
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine the emotional</v>

48
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>attachment that you have to that.</v>

49
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

50
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you can look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can google navy seals and find,</v>

52
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 million new stories about them.</v>

53
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's great.</v>

54
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>But these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have seen them,</v>

56
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

57
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

58
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about earlier how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seals,</v>

59
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like me,</v>

60
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 1>this isn't what we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>these guys didn't all necessarily have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude.</v>

62
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that were in Ramadi with us</v>

63
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>when we first got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were reserve unit out of</v>

64
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two to eight iron soldiers.</v>

65
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>They were reservists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys were teachers that like,</v>

66
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>like what you see when they talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these reserves.</v>

67
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.800
<v Speaker 1>These guys were teachers and professors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

68
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>bakers and they had real jobs and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and wanting to get home to their</v>

69
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.801
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet they were,</v>

70
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>they're grinding it out against a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardened enemy.</v>

71
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

74
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:32.311
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy thing to see and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very humbling to be around people</v>

75
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

76
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.960
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things I would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hard time coach Halter fighter.</v>

77
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll look at our,</v>

78
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissected person.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You have a hole here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hole here.</v>

82
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 3>So are you looking just to fight to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>two paychecks,</v>

83
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 3>three paychecks if cell then I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the right area.</v>

84
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 3>But if you're looking to be a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>

85
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking to be able to provide</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your family,</v>

86
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean I always thought we all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time when I was in the UFC,</v>

87
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:01.890
<v Speaker 3>when that fought for the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>championship at one 35,</v>

88
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fucking full time job and</v>

89
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:05.610
<v Speaker 3>they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it fight for world championship.</v>

90
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:06.660
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

91
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah because what have you,</v>

92

<v Speaker 3>I've lost the fight.</v>

93
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 3>So now I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made what,</v>

94
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 3>$14,000 because that what she made to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for the world title at one 35.</v>

95
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

96
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

97
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all public record.</v>

98
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:22.470

<v Speaker 3>and then that's why it's depressing.</v>

99
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.940
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I was still working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when I fight in Modo,</v>

00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 3>and we also built the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at this uh,</v>

121
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.740
<v Speaker 3>microphone came to you and it was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

<v Speaker 3>protect it.</v>

123
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I was the guy who made</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

124
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.420
