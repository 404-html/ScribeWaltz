00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>why would I put my job on the line to have an opinion about compelled pronouns?</v>

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.583
<v Speaker 1>I know why.</v>

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Because the ability to speak your truth is the bulwark against hell</v>

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>and losing your job.</v>

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing cuts,</v>

8
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>nothing compared to where things can go when they go badly.</v>

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.471
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

10
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it was just preventative.</v>

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like this isn't going in a good direction.</v>

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>While should you take a risk?</v>

13
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have that choice.</v>

14
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.243
<v Speaker 1>You're silent.</v>

15
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a risk.</v>

16
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.991
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

17
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>most people don't understand the risks of silence.</v>

18
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I happened to understand the risks of scientists because I've been studying them</v>

19
00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>for 40 years.</v>

20
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it frustrating for you to get so little support for these actions and for,</v>

21
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>for your,</v>

22
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Speaker 1>your protests?</v>

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that that's what happened and I don't mean so little support</v>

25
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>because you get a lot of support outside of the,</v>

26
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>in the outside of the university.</v>

27
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.851
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

28
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter where the support comes from.</v>

29
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean it's,</v>

30
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it's disappointing in the same way that it's disappointing for me to say.</v>

31
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities now do more harm than good.</v>

32
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>That's disappointing.</v>

33
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.873
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

34
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.051
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

35
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

36
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising to me.</v>

37
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker 1>It isn't as if intellectuals are characterized by an intrinsic moral</v>

38
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:25.541
<v Speaker 1>superiority.</v>

39
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:25.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

40
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:26.351
<v Speaker 1>they're smart.</v>

41
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>So they will leap to the defense of what's right.</v>

42
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:28.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

43
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:29.614
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for that.</v>

45
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And Intelligence and,</v>

46
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>and moral wisdom aren't the same thing.</v>

47
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

48
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>and if you're corrupt and smart,</v>

49
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>all that makes you is way more treacherous.</v>

50
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you less likely to be corrupt.</v>

51
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you much more,</v>

52
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you're 50 snakes instead of two or your 56 headed snakes instead of to,</v>

53
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

54
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who were,</v>

55
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>who had very serious personality disorders who are very intelligent.</v>

56
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not necessarily a good thing for them.</v>

57
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>They're just better at arguing for their pathology to themselves.</v>

58
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>That is a real problem where people automatically assume that intelligent people</v>

59
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>are going to be healthy.</v>

60
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Well they're healthy in that often psychological,</v>

62
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>better in the world,</v>

63
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:14.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>because their skills are skills are more marketable and so on.</v>

65
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 1>But there's no evidence that there's any relationship between intelligence and</v>

66
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:22.684
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

67
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

69
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you a story,</v>

70
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:25.451
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

71
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>One time I have this client,</v>

72
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.660
<v Speaker 1>this woman was just ruined.</v>

73
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>She looked like a street person,</v>

74
00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:30.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 1>and she had very dirty clothes and she was so shy that she couldn't even</v>

76
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.111
<v Speaker 1>approach you.</v>

77
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>She had to shield her eyes from you as if you were emitting light.</v>

78
00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And she did that to everyone on the street.</v>

79
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Like she was banned over and,</v>

80
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

81
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>and humble like a,</v>

83
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>like a Chinese peasant brought before the emperor,</v>

84
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.104
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

85
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.591
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

86
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:48.424
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I was doing with her and behavior therapy was trying to just</v>

88
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>get her to present herself in a more normal manner so that people wouldn't shy</v>

89
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>away from her and,</v>

90
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 1>be instantly prejudice towards,</v>

92
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

93
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>and she'd come to the behavior therapy clinic and she wasn't bright.</v>

94
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.881
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>

95
00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>she thinks she had only had like a seventh grade education.</v>

96
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>She was quite intellectually impaired and she lived with her,</v>

97
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>her sick aunt,</v>

98
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:12.701
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

99
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 1>who was schizophrenia and who had like a,</v>

100
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>say titanic possessed alcoholic boyfriend that was always tormenting my client.</v>

102
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>She lived in absolute hell,</v>

103
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but she had this dog and she used to take it out and walk the dog all the time.</v>

104
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>And then she,</v>

105
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>she'd actually come to the behavior therapy clinic partly because of her own</v>

106
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:33.431
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

107
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

108
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but she'd come to this place called the Douglas Hospital and she'd been an</v>

109
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>inpatient in the Douglas Hospital and in the,</v>

110
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>in the Douglas Hospital,</v>

111
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>there were these long term psychiatric clients and they looked like something</v>

112
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>out of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or Dante's inferno.</v>

113
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:47.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

114
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.664
<v Speaker 1>these people were,</v>

115
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>this is way worse than one flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>

116
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>These people were seriously destroyed and they couldn't be let back out in the</v>

117
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>streets during deinstitutionalization.</v>

118
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Like they were lifers.</v>

119
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And she had decided that part of the reason she wanted to come to the</v>

120
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>hospitalist because she had been institutionalized there and she thought that</v>

121
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe when she took her dog out for a walk,</v>

122
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>she could go and get one of those damn inmates and take them out for a walk too.</v>

123
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Now that was a person who was moral,</v>

124
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>dumb as a post,</v>

125
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>just screwed in 50 different directions.</v>

126
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Nothing going for her.</v>

127
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And she had the bloody moral capacity to decide that there was someone worse off</v>

128
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>than her.</v>

129
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.601
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

130
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't easy to find.</v>

131
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And that maybe she could do them some good if,</v>

132
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>if the hospital would let her,</v>

133
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>which they didn't by the way.</v>

134
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the story of the soul.</v>

136
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not the intellect,</v>

137
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.833
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

138
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.603
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

139
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't expect any support from my,</v>

140
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>from my colleagues.</v>

141
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.173
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

142
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.931
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't that,</v>

143
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I got it,</v>

144
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

145
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>it's in some sense it's irrelevant.</v>

146
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant to me because my goal was,</v>

147
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying those goddamn pronouns.</v>

148
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm not saying them is because they're made up by leftwing</v>

149
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 1>ideologues and I don't like left wing ideology.</v>

150
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't like ediology period.</v>

151
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And I know where</v>

152
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>corruption of speech leads and I'm not going there.</v>

153
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.871
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

154
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I tried to learn when I was taking apart what happened in</v>

155
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz and trying to put myself in the position of an Auschwitz camp guard,</v>

156
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.421
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

157
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:28.931
<v Speaker 1>you can do,</v>

158
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>if you use your imagination a bit,</v>

159
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it exactly the world's most pleasant meditative experience,</v>

160
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but you can call up parts of yourself that would be capable of taking someone</v>

161
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:44.011
<v Speaker 1>who just got off a transport train and having them carry a hundred pound sack of</v>

162
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 1>wet salt from one side of the camp compound to the other and back.</v>

163
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>You can conjure that part of yourself up if you want,</v>

164
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and that'll teach you something about what you're like.</v>

165
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>People don't do it because it's too frightening,</v>

166
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but I know perfectly well I could do that sort of thing.</v>

167
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And so once I learned that I could do that sort of thing and maybe that I could</v>

168
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:02.241
<v Speaker 1>even enjoy it,</v>

169
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:02.601
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

170
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:02.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

171
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:03.261
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

172
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

173
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see if I can figure out how to live so that if that opportunity was</v>

174
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>presented to me,</v>

175
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take it.</v>

176
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the lesson that people need to learn from the 20th century.</v>

177
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what human beings did.</v>

178
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>While we're all human.</v>

180
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.351
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

181
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>so how is it that we should live so that we don't do that again?</v>

182
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.203
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

183
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>part of that is to try to say the truth no matter what because the alternative</v>

184
00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:32.970
<v Speaker 1>is worse and it is worse.</v>

185
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 1>The truth no matter what.</v>

186
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And that is the real problem that you see with being forced into using these</v>

187
00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:41.370
<v Speaker 1>made up pronouns.</v>

188
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:42.601
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

190
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's my language all take responsibility for what I say.</v>

191
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I am not saying your words and being compelled to say your words by law.</v>

192
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.033
<v Speaker 1>Well that's that.</v>

193
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.180
<v Speaker 1>That that makes it,</v>

194
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>that that takes it past the point of absurdity to the point of tyranny in,</v>

195
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.370
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation.</v>

196
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen some criticisms where people are saying,</v>

197
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you know he's talking about this,</v>

198
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but really he's grandstanding cause no one's doing anything legally,</v>

199
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but the potential exists that such rubbish.</v>

200
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 1>But that is criminals.</v>

201
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.581
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

202
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:13.110
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have changed the damn criminal.</v>

203
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.950
<v Speaker 1>They put it in the hate speech category and altered the criminal code.</v>

204
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that and then you could say,</v>

205
00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:20.581
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

206
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:21.480
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really mean it.</v>

207
00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:21.781
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

208
00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:22.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah you did.</v>

209
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.100
<v Speaker 1>You really meant it to have the social justice warriors that have debated being</v>

210
00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the last two months accused me directly of hate speech.</v>

211
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.370
<v Speaker 1>All I had to do was poke them a tiny bit and they came right out with it.</v>

212
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the university's legal team reviewed everything I said carefully</v>

213
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 1>believe me.</v>

214
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And they decided that,</v>

215
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

216
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 1>it was not only illegal to not use these compelled pronouns,</v>

217
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it was probably illegal to make a video saying that I wouldn't use them because</v>

218
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:52.650
<v Speaker 1>otherwise why would they write me a warning letter and tell me that I violated</v>

219
00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:55.170
<v Speaker 1>university policy on the Ontario Human Rights Act?</v>

220
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.150
<v Speaker 1>He did that lightly.</v>

221
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Have they acted on this at all?</v>

222
00:07:58.741 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

223
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 1>they won't know.</v>

224
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Well they've acted in that.</v>

225
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They sent me two warning letters and told me to stop talking and the don't.</v>

226
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.630
<v Speaker 1>The idea that I was going to be teaching in January again cause I teach all my</v>

227
00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:11.580
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate courses from January to May.</v>

228
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 1>That was on the table.</v>

229
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think the only reason that it hasn't happened,</v>

230
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons it hasn't happened,</v>

231
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not attributing nothing but malevolence to the university</v>

232
00:08:21.421 --> 00:08:22.111
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

233
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:25.500
<v Speaker 1>cause obviously it's very complicated and they did agree to host the debate for</v>

234
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:26.334
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

235
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching in January and still might not be is by</v>

236
00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.150
<v Speaker 1>no means</v>

237
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.980
<v Speaker 1>that was a perfectly plausible outcome.</v>

238
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And had this not caused a firestorm,</v>

239
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.280
<v Speaker 1>much of which has emerged in supportive me.</v>

240
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Then I would say there was a 50 50 chance that I would've had my teaching</v>

241
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:50.670
<v Speaker 1>privileges revoked,</v>

242
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 1>tabbing to other professors.</v>

243
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that I'm making it,</v>

244
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I like that is a tempest in a teapot.</v>

245
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

246
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

247
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:57.841
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

248
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:58.370
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

249
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Why did you change the criminal code then?</v>

250
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And why did you put it under the hate speech laws?</v>

251
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.223
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

252
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.143
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

253
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't wash.</v>

254
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>

255
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.880
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental proof of that is the university's response because for sure</v>

256
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.130
<v Speaker 1>there are legal team crafted those letters.</v>

257
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what was like recalcitrant employee,</v>

258
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for them.</v>

259
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

260
00:09:20.241 --> 00:09:22.040
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with a recalcitrant deployed?</v>

261
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>You write them a letter telling them what they're doing wrong and asking him to</v>

262
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:25.940
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

263
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Then if they don't stop,</v>

264
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:29.150
<v Speaker 1>you write them a second letter that's more strongly worded.</v>

265
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Then if they don't stop,</v>

266
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you write them a third letter,</v>

267
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.440
<v Speaker 1>even more strongly worded.</v>

268
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you take disciplinary action.</v>

269
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.470
<v Speaker 1>That's like HR 101 that's how you do it.</v>

270
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

271
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 1>so here we said at the end of November,</v>

272
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.900
<v Speaker 1>closing on December,</v>

274
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you're literally a a bit more than a month away and you don't know whether or</v>

275
00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:50.780
<v Speaker 1>not you're teaching your courses in January.</v>

276
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It seems highly probable that I'll be teaching them.</v>

277
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's certain,</v>

278
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.430
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm teaching them,</v>

279
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>it's because the cost of having me not teach them would now be too high.</v>

280
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not because the university believes that what I'm doing is either necessary</v>

281
00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:17.770
<v Speaker 1>or acceptable.</v>

282
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 1>If someone who's listening to this or watching this feels compelled to act out</v>

283
00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:24.580
<v Speaker 1>in your support,</v>

284
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Speaker 1>how can they do that?</v>

285
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I think they could do the future authoring exercise</v>

286
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.250
<v Speaker 1>and that that would be the best way to act on your,</v>

287
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about this.</v>

288
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:39.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like sort yourself out,</v>

289
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.690
<v Speaker 1>sort yourself out.</v>

290
00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You're so you try to figure out the world and the text.</v>

291
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the primary objective.</v>

292
00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:45.010
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

293
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 1>that's your most important thing that you can do yourself out.</v>

294
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Sort yourself out and,</v>

295
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:53.710
<v Speaker 1>and Marshall your arguments and put yourself in order so that when someone</v>

296
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 1>pushes you a little farther than you should go,</v>

297
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you can say no,</v>

298
00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's going on now.</v>

299
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
