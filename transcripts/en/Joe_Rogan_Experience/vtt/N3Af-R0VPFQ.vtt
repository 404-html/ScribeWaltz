8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An answer your question.</v>

9
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

10
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>What's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like neither one answers,</v>

12
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's acceptable for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to change that.</v>

13
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 2>We've going to change a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Documentary freaking the fuck out.</v>

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowspiracy um,</v>

15
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pause as podcasts.</v>

16
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Go to Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only on Netflix.</v>

17
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I tried to find on apple TV and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

18
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only netflix.</v>

19
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Netflix continues to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 2>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

21
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your documentary is very scary.</v>

22
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those documentary suite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at a lot of documentaries</v>

23
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

24
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a bias in this documentary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

25
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking that,</v>

26
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.724
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

27
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the negative aspects of this outweigh</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive aspects of it.</v>

28
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 2>But it's debatable when you look at your</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

29
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things where you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

30
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I shut it off after it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like one o'clock in the morning.</v>

31
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I was getting ready to go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a good idea to plan the</v>

32
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.860
<v Speaker 2>fucking rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about the future of the world,</v>

33
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 2>FTC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a documentary like yours.</v>

34
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sitting there going,</v>

35
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>

36
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>He's not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say like when you look at the</v>

37
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 2>devastation that's being done with</v>
<v Speaker 2>livestock in this country,</v>

38
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 2>when you look soberly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it soberly,</v>

39
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 2>look at the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's soberly look at the amount of land</v>

40
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>they need to graze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You soberly look at the amount of people</v>

41
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>that we smoosh into these little areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we don't grow shit and we call</v>

42
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>them cities and we have to truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in.</v>

43
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 2>When you soberly look at the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>methane that's being reduced but</v>

44
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 2>produced by cow shit and cow farts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the reaction that you guys got</v>

45
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>when you tried to bring up that aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

46
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 2>that was the weirdest part of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

47
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I expected going in that the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>would sort of highlight some issues that</v>

48
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 2>people have already with factory farming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and show you,</v>

49
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what effect it had on the environment.</v>

50
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't anticipate it would be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of an effect and I didn't</v>

51
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>anticipate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get the kind of resistance</v>

52
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:26.171
<v Speaker 2>that you got from activists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activists that are scared of that</v>

53
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

54
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>what was it like making that documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was actually more to the Mo,</v>

55
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.970
<v Speaker 2>more of the motivation was that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental groups,</v>

56
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the greenpeaces reinforce section that</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

57
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sierra Club that they didn't address</v>

58
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>this issue was more of inspiration to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the film and pissed us off to the</v>

59
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>point of making the film more than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual facts themselves.</v>

60
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>And the facts are so overwhelming when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>found them out,</v>

61
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they didn't talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

62
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.103
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

63
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayed and,</v>

64
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:55.971
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

65
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I started calling them,</v>

66
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it became really kind of off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is kip Andersen talking,</v>

67
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Keegan Kuhn is the other gentlemen</v>

68
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 2>to his right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

69
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

70
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I kind of liking it a little there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're scared.</v>

71
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>They're obviously scared this or they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicit is one of two things,</v>

72
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either they're scared or they're taking</v>

73
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 2>money from these environmental groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be both.</v>

74
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another one.</v>

75
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And also they're contributing to it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they imagine you're the America.</v>

76
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what it meant when I said taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>money from these environmental groups.</v>

77
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I switched around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met the environmental groups are</v>

78
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>taking money from that industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also to imagine you're the American</v>

79
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Lung Association and you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>around board of director meetings,</v>

80
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.670
<v Speaker 2>you all smoking cigarettes and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're telling somebody not smoke</v>

81
00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

82
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's a huge part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

83
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 2>we walked in a couple organizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups during lunch and here they're,</v>

84
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in front of like a</v>

85
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouse eating their lunch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're discussing how to say the rain</v>

86
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 2>forest and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

87
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>while we connect your connection here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating burgers and shit.</v>

88
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Talks about the rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

89
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another thing that really disturbed me</v>

90
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 2>about your documentary was when that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gentleman who was a former cattle</v>

91
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 2>rancher was talking about his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his being sued and how the industry sued</v>

92
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>him and he'd gotten some real deep legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>

93
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:11.551
<v Speaker 2>cost him a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how now today with the Patriot Act,</v>

94
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 2>he would have never won the case because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you're correct now.</v>

95
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Now if you have an action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you make a documentary,</v>

96
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>you do something that adversely affects</v>
<v Speaker 2>that industry or any industry where they</v>

97
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>can prove they're losing money by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriot Act,</v>

98
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>your league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're legally complicit or you legally</v>

99
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 2>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

100
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that how it works?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Well so there is a law created call the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and it</v>

102
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 3>was focused on just animal rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>activists and environmental rights</v>

103
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 3>activist and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

104
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 3>the law says anyone who disrupts the</v>
<v Speaker 3>business of an animal enterprise is</v>

105
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 3>committing an act of terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

106
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 3>That's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

107
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean cause then that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so far reaching.</v>

108
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 3>That's from someone who saves one</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken from a farm or someone who does</v>

109
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 3>a protest or I mean there's three</v>
<v Speaker 3>activists up in the bay who are arrested</v>

110
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 3>under the law for doing passing out</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaflets and doing chalk outlines on</v>

111
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.000
<v Speaker 3>sidewalks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy.</v>

112
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Total violation of first amendment</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so,</v>

113
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

114
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 2>fucking wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so wrong and so dangerous when you</v>

115
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 2>let an industry just dictate just by</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheer money what people can and can't</v>

116
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>protest feet deep things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>find morally reprehensible.</v>

117
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why there's these ag</v>
<v Speaker 2>gag laws.</v>

118
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>What ag gag laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not aware,</v>

119
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's laws against taking film footage</v>

120
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>of those pigs that are shoved into those</v>
<v Speaker 2>cages and chicken shoved into cages and</v>

121
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>cruelty to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever watched any of those</v>

122
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.070
<v Speaker 2>disturbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>videos at p to puts up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

124
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 2>they'll show like a guy like sheering</v>
<v Speaker 2>wool and kicking the shit out of the</v>

125
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 2>lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking,</v>

126
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

127
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

128
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Or is it a sheep or lamb?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lamb was a young one,</v>

129
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what what it is?</v>

130
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys like you think,</v>

131
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:48.581
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wearing,</v>

132
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

133
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 2>they just give him a haircut.</v>

134
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They beat the fuck out of those things</v>

135
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 2>because those things don't want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>haircut and they're,</v>

136
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.290
<v Speaker 2>they bleed and cause they're not gentle</v>
<v Speaker 2>with those sheers.</v>

137
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I don't know if it's just one</v>

138
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 2>time that they filmed this and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>one asshole.</v>

139
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 2>But there's laws against filming those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things now.</v>

140
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So the only way that that ever stops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way people ever go,</v>

141
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm only gonna eat free range this or</v>

142
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>grass fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

143
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 2>The only way that happens ever as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to know what the consequences of</v>

144
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.290
<v Speaker 2>not doing that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to know if you off,</v>

145
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you're buying this factory raised meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how it lives.</v>

146
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Are you cool with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are not cool with that.</v>

147
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 2>So instead of fixing it and making it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

148
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 2>they make it illegal to report all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical,</v>

149
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>fucked up dark shit they're doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that is,</v>

150
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>that's so fucking anti-american.</v>

151
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>It at every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

152
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that's shows how powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>this industry is.</v>

153
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>It literally can dictate to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government what they want the laws to</v>

154
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.031
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Yeah.</v>

155
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>The yag lost dump benefit consumers in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any way.</v>

156
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 2>They are completely written by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry themselves.</v>

157
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Those motherfuckers need to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

158
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>All those people that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those chicken farms and pig farms to the</v>

159
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>cows just grow some please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

160
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand they're making a fuck load</v>

161
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:06.081
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

162
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to stop making a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>load of money.</v>

163
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that that's all you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is just have so much money coming in</v>

164
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 2>that you can get away with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that any different than like</v>

165
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>animal beastiality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's it any different than animal</v>

166
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 2>torture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like animal torture is illegal.</v>

167
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 2>If like Michael Vick got in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was shooting his dogs and</v>

168
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 2>killing him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how has that really different than the</v>

169
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 2>way they treat pigs?</v>

170
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 2>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>

171
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>at least the dogs had a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 2>these animals had no chance at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know those dogs?</v>

173
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess a dogs have a chance.</v>

174
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about pit bulls is the real,</v>

175
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>the ones they use for fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they breed them to not have any animal</v>

176
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could beat the shit out of them.</v>

177
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 2>They don't fight back then they're bred</v>
<v Speaker 2>to never sort of go after people.</v>

178
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

179
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't beside the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is this,</v>

180
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 2>this industry has so much fucking money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're able to do something that I</v>

181
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 2>think pretty much everybody would</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree with and that stop you from</v>

182
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 2>letting people be aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of their purchase power.</v>

183
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>They're buying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy,</v>

184
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 2>you want to buy the cheapest meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to buy the cheapest meat</v>

185
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

186
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 2>This is how it's grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

187
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 2>this is how it's managed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how they bring these things to</v>

188
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you comfortable with that thing is</v>

189
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.860
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not only,</v>

190
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if even if you have organic or the</v>

191
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>free range or you know all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>more more than anything in marketing</v>

192
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't let you,</v>

193
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>they don't let you in these places as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as across the board.</v>

194
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Doug during,</v>

195
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:36.760
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Wisconsin and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

196
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 2>he owns a farm and he has grass fed cows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

197
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I had one idea of what it's like to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass fed cow and then I visited his</v>

198
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 2>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my idea of what it's like to be a</v>

199
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.840
<v Speaker 2>grass fed cow and he only has a few cows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a gigantic farms,</v>

200
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred acres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

201
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not his main business.</v>

202
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like a family thing that he does</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he grows his own beef.</v>

203
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Those cows are fucking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go in that cage though,</v>

204
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.090
<v Speaker 2>they fucking run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run and they bunch up and I,</v>

205
00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and I was out there and went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

206
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 2>they know what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that much space.</v>

207
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they have a giant pasture,</v>

208
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you obviously have to be able to rope</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in cause you're gonna eventually</v>

209
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 2>kill him and they kind of know it</v>

210
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.250
<v Speaker 4>go anywhere near those fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think of it as like those pigs in</v>

211
00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 4>your documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those pigs that those people were</v>

212
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 4>raising in northern California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were kind of like pets.</v>

213
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.170
<v Speaker 4>They came over and these little kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>were petting them and stuff.</v>

214
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.290
<v Speaker 4>That's not how his cows are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cows are fucking running for their life,</v>

215
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.330
<v Speaker 4>and the thing is those cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know,</v>

216
00:09:31.331 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 4>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know what's going on and they're</v>

217
00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:33.994
<v Speaker 4>only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

218
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.230
<v Speaker 4>they're just babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

219
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:38.770
<v Speaker 4>they get killed at 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine they can live as long as dogs.</v>

220
00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Imagine a puppy getting killed at 18</v>
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>

221
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.350
<v Speaker 4>They know what's going on in 18 months</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the grass fed,</v>

222
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 4>no grain fed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

223
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Grass beds even longer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about 24 months because they have</v>

224
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:51.610
<v Speaker 4>to take some longer to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just there.</v>

225
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.690
<v Speaker 4>They're eating their natural diet.</v>

226
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Speaker 2>What did we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how'd we get here?</v>

227
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.810
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did human beings can get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this position where,</v>

228
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's wonderful in terms of our</v>

229
00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:05.110
<v Speaker 2>ability to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create technology,</v>

230
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.670
<v Speaker 2>educate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

231
00:10:06.671 --> 00:10:07.411
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a,</v>

232
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.411
<v Speaker 2>what a gigantic relief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been to remove the daily necessity</v>

233
00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Speaker 2>of gathering food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a gigantic relief and it's</v>

234
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.260
<v Speaker 2>caused the human race to accelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to technologically innovate at a before</v>

235
00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:24.760
<v Speaker 2>never seen pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

236
00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:27.490
<v Speaker 2>what we've been able to do over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years,</v>

237
00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:32.491
<v Speaker 2>it's been nothing short of insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the consequences seem to be not</v>

238
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:37.861
<v Speaker 2>thought out and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not planned for and no solution in place</v>

239
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.633
<v Speaker 2>to mitigate it.</v>

240
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing is the,</v>

241
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.880
<v Speaker 4>when we talk about population in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>film,</v>

242
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and was at 19 1800 is one 1 billion,</v>

243
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.600
<v Speaker 4>1901.5 2000 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 4>7 billion just exploded.</v>

244
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:58.490
<v Speaker 4>And then not only that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the necessity to the meat consumption in</v>

245
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.860
<v Speaker 4>dairy consumption and just in the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years.</v>

246
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of these people have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>notion of,</v>

247
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:04.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grass fed,</v>

248
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:06.260
<v Speaker 4>that's where get into and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>organic,</v>

249
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:08.270
<v Speaker 4>but they're living in a time where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years ago,</v>

250
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 4>a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in 2000 now.</v>

251
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 4>16 that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a reality.</v>

252
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of us,</v>

253
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.180
<v Speaker 4>dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people are cool.</v>

254
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Speaker 4>I like a micron is around a lot around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

255
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:23.894
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

256
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.960
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a catch 22 like,</v>

257
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 4>but there's definitely do many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fuck,</v>

258
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome having so many people</v>

259
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.330
<v Speaker 2>because having somebody be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find uh,</v>

260
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.820
<v Speaker 2>I love like going into a rural areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountains and stuff like that,</v>

261
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think living there I would miss</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that you get and</v>

262
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.930
<v Speaker 2>like the Los Angeles area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of like really cool</v>

263
00:11:43.931 --> 00:11:47.060
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the in giant groups you are,</v>

264
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.190
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to find a large</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of cool people just by sheer</v>

265
00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 2>volume just by numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

266
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing that's looked at in the</v>

267
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:57.540
<v Speaker 3>film is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

268
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 3>how do you feed 7.2 billion people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way you're really going to do</v>

269
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 3>it is to eat as ecologically as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

270
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's a plant based diet or getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>as close to a plant based diet as she</v>

271
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:06.920
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

272
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

273
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.920
<v Speaker 2>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what I like to do,</v>

274
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I grow a lot of my own vegetables and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been the last few years I've been</v>

275
00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:18.170
<v Speaker 2>hunting in this year eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to at least exclusively stuff</v>

276
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:20.900
<v Speaker 2>that I've killed myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody can't do that.</v>

277
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't preach that as an ethic.</v>

278
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.700
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's just not possible first of</v>

279
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:26.450
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time wise,</v>

280
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.330
<v Speaker 2>not possible for most folks with</v>
<v Speaker 2>families or with jobs.</v>

281
00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:32.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just they just don't have the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gather that much meat to feed your</v>

282
00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:34.730
<v Speaker 2>whole family for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you eat meat,</v>

283
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four days a week,</v>

284
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 2>even you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be able to do it.</v>

285
00:12:38.811 --> 00:12:40.910
<v Speaker 2>And then two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing is there's just not</v>

286
00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:42.920
<v Speaker 2>enough animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just not,</v>

287
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.290
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough white tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more white tailed deer right now</v>

288
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:47.990
<v Speaker 2>than there have ever been ever in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of this continent,</v>

289
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Speaker 2>just by management,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by wildlife protection agencies and um,</v>

290
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fish and game departments,</v>

291
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.530
<v Speaker 2>making sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.410
<v Speaker 2>these animals have adequate habitat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only take a certain amount per year</v>

293
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:03.560
<v Speaker 2>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's more whitetail deer than</v>

294
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:06.110
<v Speaker 2>there have ever been in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not enough to feed everybody,</v>

295
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.060
<v Speaker 2>not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close.</v>

296
00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 2>We would kill them all and we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>still be starving.</v>

297
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.261
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

298
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean hunting really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause people have brought that up.</v>

299
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what about sustainable hunting?</v>

300
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is that we've replaced</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the wild animals on the planet</v>

301
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 3>with our domesticated animals and we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken the wild animals land and we've</v>

302
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 3>used it to grow feed to feed livestock</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to graze livestock.</v>

303
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as you said,</v>

304
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've literally replaced 90% of wildlife</v>

305
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 3>with our own species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what wildlife isn't there anymore?</v>

306
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 3>That was besides obvious ones like</v>
<v Speaker 3>buffalo.</v>

307
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the obvious like</v>

308
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 3>megafauna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

309
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

310
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 3>you'll have to look at timber wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eastern timberwolves were basically</v>

311
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 3>wiped out primarily for fur trade and</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they preyed on cattle.</v>

312
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you have other species that</v>

313
00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 3>move in and so you see an explosion of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

314
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whitetail deer.</v>

315
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 3>But that's because we've eliminated all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other species around them,</v>

316
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>laminated all the predators because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators are a threat to the livestock.</v>

317
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 3>And so once you eliminate the predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have all these deer running</v>

318
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 3>around and multiplying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's where wildlife</v>

319
00:14:08.651 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 3>management comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is complete bullshit because we're</v>

320
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wildlife management is good already</v>

321
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:17.020
<v Speaker 3>getting ready rid of the cows and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of all the other wildlife,</v>

322
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 3>all the other wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife doc,</v>

323
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.770
<v Speaker 3>getting rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

324
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.103
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

325
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically what's happening,</v>

326
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.160
<v Speaker 3>just one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one year ago,</v>

327
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the stats on how many,</v>

328
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:29.870
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

329
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 3>US Department of Agriculture has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife services program and they</v>

330
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 3>eliminate wild animals who prey on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>livestock industry.</v>

331
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 3>So they killed mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes mean it's like 60,000 coyotes</v>

332
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 3>last year were killed by the US</v>
<v Speaker 3>government because they're perceived as</v>

333
00:14:46.361 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 3>a threat to this industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 wolves,</v>

334
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 3>500 black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're</v>

335
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 5>aware of the reintroduction of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know about all that and like how</v>

336
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 5>they reintroduce wolves to North America</v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

337
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from actually from Canada.</v>

338
00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.571
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating.</v>

339
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:00.690
<v Speaker 5>It's very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

340
00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

341
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because a elk population has been</v>

342
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 5>decimated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then they've also attacked some</v>

343
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 5>livestock in British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When my friend Mike Lives,</v>

344
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his neighbor's cow was taken out by a</v>

345
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 5>wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they were,</v>

346
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.490
<v Speaker 5>they were all sitting around from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking bedroom window watching a pack</v>

347
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 5>of monsters tear cal park,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like right in this little pen.</v>

348
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be fucking spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

349
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 5>but still mean wolf populations aren't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even anywhere close to what they were a</v>

350
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.801
<v Speaker 5>century ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

351
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 5>But in some states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have exceeded the number that they</v>

352
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:32.840
<v Speaker 5>intended to let them get too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

353
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 5>And so that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that when you,</v>

354
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.970
<v Speaker 5>cause that's going back to these</v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental realizations.</v>

355
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 5>Sierra club's got a big campaign by save</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wolves and all these organizations</v>

356
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:40.641
<v Speaker 5>save the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll say the lowest,</v>

357
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 5>but they're not talking about why wolves</v>
<v Speaker 5>are on the verge of collapse.</v>

358
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like we got these species off the</v>

359
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 5>endangered species list and now they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>opened up out to hunting in Idaho and</v>

360
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 5>you know at the states that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>population that bloomed again and it's</v>

361
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 5>because of the cattle industry is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the wolves have exceeded that</v>

362
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 5>ecological capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your carrying capacity of the ecosystem.</v>

363
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 5>It's the fact that they're competing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with livestock.</v>

364
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Well they've also reached a number that</v>
<v Speaker 5>have passed the number where the</v>

365
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 5>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biologist,</v>

366
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:11.150
<v Speaker 5>wildlife biologist deemed there would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a healthy sustainable population and not</v>

367
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:13.640
<v Speaker 5>be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when they get to,</v>

368
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 5>you know what we call a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course it's when they interfere with</v>

369
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.410
<v Speaker 5>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's when they started eating</v>

370
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 5>livestock.</v>

371
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people's dogs and occasionally</v>

372
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 5>joggers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

373
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 5>she didn't shit goes wrong with walls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

374
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 5>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the issue is um,</v>

375
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 5>management right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

376
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 5>To some people it means like leave</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature alone and let nature sorted out.</v>

377
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 5>But two people in indigenous areas like</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

378
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>native Americans and people in Canada,</v>

379
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of them rely on moose and</v>
<v Speaker 5>deer to feed themselves.</v>

380
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is where they get their meat from</v>

381
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 5>and they have to keep both populations</v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

382
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 5>If they don't keep wolf populations down</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wolf,</v>

383
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've already as it is,</v>

384
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:59.891
<v Speaker 5>wolves and bears kill something like 50%</v>
<v Speaker 5>of all calves and the fonts that come</v>

385
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 5>out of deer and Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they do,</v>

386
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 5>since there's no nothing that kills</v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves,</v>

387
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 5>like you have to kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise they get to the point where</v>

388
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.590
<v Speaker 5>have you ever been to like a upstate New</v>
<v Speaker 5>York and drive through those areas where</v>

389
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 5>there's so many deer you have to drive</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 20 miles an hour because at</v>

390
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 5>nighttime they just darted in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>your car like fucking rats.</v>

391
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 5>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

392
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 5>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many deer there are in some places.</v>

393
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.590
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's no population control,</v>

394
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 5>there's no predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these are areas where there's just</v>

395
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 5>not that many people and not that many</v>
<v Speaker 5>people hunting.</v>

396
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 5>So you just get fuck load of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking deer running around everywhere.</v>

397
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:33.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

398
00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:36.470
<v Speaker 5>that is that imbalance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we've seen with ecology</v>

399
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.600
<v Speaker 5>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Indigenous communities have found,</v>

400
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a hunter gatherer.</v>

401
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Communities around the world have shown</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can live in balance with</v>

402
00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:43.550
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

403
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what we're living today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wildlife biologist,</v>

404
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 5>they'll do believe that the way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>balance out as you have to keep</v>

405
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 2>populations of predators down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why if you go back to</v>

406
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the fairy tales,</v>

407
00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:58.320
<v Speaker 2>the big bad wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Red Riding Hood,</v>

408
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three little pigs were all wolves.</v>

409
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Wolves are fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're real dangerous.</v>

410
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And in terms of like recent history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War One,</v>

411
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 2>the Russians and the Germans had a cease</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire because they were trying to kill</v>

412
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>each other and wolves kept killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were getting so many soldiers</v>

413
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 2>killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally had a ceasefire and just</v>

414
00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>went on a wolf killing rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how scary wolves are.</v>

415
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 2>They can stop armies from killing each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

416
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.510
<v Speaker 2>So I think we all as compassionate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who love nature,</v>

417
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>we have some beautiful ideas of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature is and some beautiful ideas of</v>

418
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:37.290
<v Speaker 2>how North American populations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals should be managed.</v>

419
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:42.291
<v Speaker 2>But Wildlife Biologists look at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a very sober I and they're,</v>

420
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.930
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they're opening up</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting for wolves in Idaho and some</v>

421
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:52.410
<v Speaker 2>other areas is not just to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

422
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 2>It's also to keep these motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 2>from getting out of control.</v>

423
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause there are wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're beautiful,</v>

424
00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 2>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love them.</v>

425
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I love that they're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if they do jack a giant percentage</v>

426
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 2>of the elk population and it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool man.</v>

427
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Wolves are cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

428
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:12.060
<v Speaker 2>to be out in here and see like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack of,</v>

429
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:12.894
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

430
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an electrical living beauty and all</v>

431
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if it's gone,</v>

432
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>it's gone forever and you can never</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>

433
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And right now it's here and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should enjoy it.</v>

434
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Be got to keep a fucking eye on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

435
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And when the wildlife biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sober ones go,</v>

436
00:19:27.151 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got too many,</v>

437
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you've got a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to open up hunting for them</v>

438
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just keep breeding and then what do</v>

439
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:35.910
<v Speaker 2>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll,</v>

440
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.940
<v Speaker 2>so there's this really dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator that roams around the planet,</v>

441
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 2>walks on two legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called him,</v>

442
00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>and I get it.</v>

443
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the most dominant species on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that creditor,</v>

444
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:43.770
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cool,</v>

445
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't advocate for those.</v>

446
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.730
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't eliminate them,</v>

447
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 2>but she can move away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

448
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:51.150
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if human beings,</v>

449
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 2>but the wools kept human beings come in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and start jacking and killing people.</v>

450
00:19:54.961 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what's called war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we have armies to protect</v>

451
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 2>against human beings when human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>do get out of control.</v>

452
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 2>But if wolves were cool and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging around and I squirrels and they</v>

453
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 2>never killed your dog and then ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>threaten your children,</v>

454
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a totally different</v>

455
00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:08.980
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

456
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>When was the last death of a wolf and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

457
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I last year we'll ask now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska.</v>

458
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

459
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 2>there's not that many people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering through the woods by</v>

460
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:20.470
<v Speaker 2>themselves and wolves are usually aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when they see human beings are</v>

461
00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>either in cars or their rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've had friends that were stocked</v>

462
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 2>by wolves.</v>

463
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends that were on bow</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting expeditions where they thought</v>

464
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 2>they were going to die because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>stocked by wolves because wolves,</v>

465
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 2>if they can get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will fucking kill you.</v>

466
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had bows and our hands to their</v>

467
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't gonna kill you.</v>

468
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>Ain't going to kill them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might get one wolf you if you're</v>

469
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 2>lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a compound bow and a wolf's running</v>

470
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good fucking luck.</v>

471
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.740
<v Speaker 2>You've got to set your sight crock</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

472
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got to adjust it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the wolf's coming in,</v>

473
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.980
<v Speaker 2>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's speaking like say about Idaho,</v>

474
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wildlife in there is cows,</v>

475
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cows and a few wolves,</v>

476
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

477
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cows take up.</v>

478
00:20:57.811 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 2>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take up so much space.</v>

479
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:04.030
<v Speaker 2>If you remove all those fences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those millions of miles and fences</v>

480
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 2>and millions of acres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you let the wolves have that land</v>

481
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you let the other predators</v>

482
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 2>come back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have a balance going on.</v>

483
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 2>But it's the fences and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 2>you talk about the wildlife management,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

485
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit because just by killing</v>

486
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 2>some wolves and not addressing the cows</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fences,</v>

487
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

488
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is certainly a lot of cows,</v>

489
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:26.890
<v Speaker 2>nine home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a lot of wild game.</v>

490
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like deer hunting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho is famous,</v>

491
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 2>like elk hunting in Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we one of the best places to go in</v>

492
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not entirely true.</v>

493
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.210
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho,</v>

494
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 2>if you've gone to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this idea of Idaho is being</v>

495
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>like sort of this like boring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat,</v>

496
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people don't go there.</v>

497
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 2>They think of it as like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>

498
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to visit Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spectacular.</v>

499
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Have you been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

500
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 2>that's from the fucking mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a spectacular place.</v>

501
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.090
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of wildlife and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sports men,</v>

502
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>hunter people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of Fisher people fishing.</v>

503
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Then that's the amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to live in Alaska and you'd just</v>

504
00:22:04.441 --> 00:22:06.260
<v Speaker 3>see Moose everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:07.590
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incredible.</v>

506
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we still,</v>

507
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.880
<v Speaker 3>we don't have that perspective of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago,</v>

508
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 3>the biodiversity and they mount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals was that much more,</v>

509
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.730
<v Speaker 3>and 500 years ago was even now much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

510
00:22:16.731 --> 00:22:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm living in the bay and when we talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the indigenous people literally</v>

511
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:23.460
<v Speaker 3>didn't go more than 10 miles from where</v>
<v Speaker 3>their village was because there's so</v>

512
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:24.990
<v Speaker 3>many animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much food.</v>

513
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've just eliminated that.</v>

514
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 3>But if you want to have an apple store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that.</v>

515
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 2>But also too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

516
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.160
<v Speaker 2>the wildlife and the Idaho that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

517
00:22:34.161 --> 00:22:36.050
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not that much predators.</v>

518
00:22:36.051 --> 00:22:39.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more predators and will</v>

519
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.540
<v Speaker 2>the world's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know they're real big populations</v>

520
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:44.120
<v Speaker 2>of wolves now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still,</v>

521
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:46.130
<v Speaker 2>it says a fraction of what action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it used to be.</v>

522
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And then you also like as far as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>West,</v>

523
00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:53.090
<v Speaker 2>the bears and the cougars and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes that are just getting destroyed.</v>

524
00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 2>And people talk about wildlife cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of Moose and a bunch of</v>

525
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.370
<v Speaker 2>elk and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the payers,</v>

526
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.010
<v Speaker 2>the bears and cougars and wolves are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

527
00:23:01.011 --> 00:23:03.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have very strict numbers of</v>

528
00:23:03.921 --> 00:23:07.220
<v Speaker 2>how many you can kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's cougars or whether it's</v>

529
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:10.310
<v Speaker 2>bears or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And bears are extremely hard to kill.</v>

530
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Like in California in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've made it so it's almost</v>

531
00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:15.350
<v Speaker 2>impossible to kill bears.</v>

532
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 2>You can't use bait and you can't use</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

533
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And walls,</v>

534
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bears are way smarter than then.</v>

535
00:23:21.741 --> 00:23:23.900
<v Speaker 2>You give him credit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They smell things a mile away.</v>

536
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:25.520
<v Speaker 2>They hear things you're never going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

537
00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you start coming through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods,</v>

538
00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:32.051
<v Speaker 2>they're just kind of not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's this overwhelming</v>

539
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.730
<v Speaker 2>idea that we have to go out and decimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the coyotes and all of the bears</v>

540
00:23:37.731 --> 00:23:40.760
<v Speaker 2>and all of the wolves and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cougars that's not going on.</v>

541
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes are the only one out of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole list.</v>

542
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.840
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people worry about coyotes</v>

543
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 2>encroaching upon urban areas and killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats and dogs.</v>

544
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 2>And my neighbor's dog was killed by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote.</v>

545
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time,</v>

546
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like they're out there</v>

547
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.470
<v Speaker 2>killing all the bears.</v>

548
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Like you're just fucking serious jail</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

549
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 2>If you kill a bear and you don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tag and you can't even kill them in</v>

550
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:04.830
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

551
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 2>cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't even kill them.</v>

552
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 2>So mountain lions in California or just</v>
<v Speaker 2>running all over the place.</v>

553
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Killing cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

554
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 2>The reason though is that we've gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that place.</v>

555
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 2>We've decimated this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the populations to such a low point that</v>

556
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 2>now they have to put in these mandates</v>
<v Speaker 2>and controls to try and keep the species</v>

557
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

558
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they did it though.</v>

559
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.480
<v Speaker 2>It was like when they started killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these wolves back in the day when</v>

560
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:29.870
<v Speaker 2>they started poisoning them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it because they were dangerous.</v>

561
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Like they had gotten to high numbers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had realized that as soon as people</v>

562
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:35.850
<v Speaker 2>start stockpiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>livestock,</v>

564
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 2>this is an easy place to hit.</v>

565
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 2>And so they would just keep coming back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

566
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've heard of the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>super packs of wolves that they've had</v>

567
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.090
<v Speaker 2>issues with in Siberia where these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

568
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't do a damn thing about it</v>

569
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:53.410
<v Speaker 2>because there's a hundred Wolf's tearing</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart a horse and there that's,</v>

570
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does happen with wolves.</v>

571
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is something,</v>

572
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I see all of your points on nature and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with you 100% on the factory</v>

573
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:08.720
<v Speaker 2>farming situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have to be real careful</v>

574
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to just letting wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 2>be wild.</v>

575
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>predators that you can have before</v>

576
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 2>things get dangerous.</v>

577
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 4>The big one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

578
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 4>that the film addresses is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the livestock,</v>

579
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's gotten out of control</v>

580
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.840
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's literally destroying</v>
<v Speaker 4>and taking over the wildlife.</v>

581
00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 4>So if you really concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife,</v>

582
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:32.540
<v Speaker 4>if you're real wildlife person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last thing you do was not only</v>

583
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:34.520
<v Speaker 4>consume,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say factory farm,</v>

584
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:37.290
<v Speaker 4>but that's a whole thing about our film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think it's about factory farm.</v>

585
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 4>We don't even talk about factory farm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talk about the grass fed beef,</v>

586
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 4>we talk about the organic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organic,</v>

587
00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 4>a free rein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

588
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 4>organic grass fed milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's killing the wildlife.</v>

589
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:50.890
<v Speaker 4>And that's the whole point of what we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

590
00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 4>we jumped past the factory farm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause ironically for wildlife,</v>

591
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:58.200
<v Speaker 4>if you care truly about wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they discuss when we talk to</v>

592
00:25:58.201 --> 00:26:01.880
<v Speaker 4>the animals animal agriculture alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

593
00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 4>they say people think we're living in</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere 50 years ago,</v>

594
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 4>a hundred years ago.</v>

595
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 4>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're living in a place with 7 billion</v>

596
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way to efficiently feed people</v>

597
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 4>who want to eat meat is to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them in factory farms,</v>

598
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:13.670
<v Speaker 4>their factory farms because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>efficient.</v>

599
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.180
<v Speaker 4>They only take around two acres per cow</v>
<v Speaker 4>or is the grass fed cow?</v>

600
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about your buddy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wisconsin.</v>

601
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 4>The guy in our film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had cattle in Wisconsin.</v>

602
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 4>He said 50 acres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 acres for one fucking cow.</v>

603
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 4>One cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 acres.</v>

604
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 4>50 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think how big that is.</v>

605
00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:33.650
<v Speaker 4>No other wildlife can enter that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the last thing you'd want to</v>

606
00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 4>eat is grass fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last thing you wanted to be fed is</v>

607
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would beating as these,</v>

608
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>organic dairy farms as destroying all</v>

609
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>our water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>water resources,</v>

610
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 4>the rivers and destroying all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>predators.</v>

611
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 4>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

612
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other wildlife that you're talking</v>

613
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

614
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 4>But the argument would be that when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a grass fed cow and it's eating on</v>

615
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 4>50 acres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where it's getting its food from.</v>

616
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you have a factory raised</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

617
00:26:56.511 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 4>it's getting corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That corn is raising independently on</v>

618
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 4>some other large area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two acres or two acres?</v>

619
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Two eight two acres to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah cause you can grow a corn so much</v>

620
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 4>prager and grass fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It needs 50 acres that no other horse,</v>

621
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:11.280
<v Speaker 4>no other bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no other cougar.</v>

622
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Know that all these animals that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

623
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 4>no other animal can live on that area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that during the life of the animal?</v>

624
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:17.850
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just period.</v>

625
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:21.280
<v Speaker 4>That's just till slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's constantly so mad.</v>

626
00:27:21.281 --> 00:27:23.970
<v Speaker 4>You're on a 50 foot fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing else.</v>

627
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.500
<v Speaker 4>What's way more than 50 foot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 50 50 acres.</v>

628
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.550
<v Speaker 4>50 acres for one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the last thing you want to be</v>

629
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:30.990
<v Speaker 4>eating is grass fed beef.</v>

630
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.640
<v Speaker 4>If you really care about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>

631
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 4>if you really care about wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

632
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 4>you need to say either I fucked the cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screw the cow.</v>

633
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 4>The cow is a miserable life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

634
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:42.520
<v Speaker 4>I care a lot about more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know about the,</v>

635
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.740
<v Speaker 4>the elk and the Moose and the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care more about wildlife than I do</v>

636
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.020
<v Speaker 4>about this cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to choose one or the other if</v>

637
00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:50.850
<v Speaker 4>you're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you could really care about</v>

638
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:53.280
<v Speaker 4>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to say screw the cow.</v>

639
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 4>And then Sco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

640
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 4>with factory farm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the whole irony of this whole</v>

641
00:27:57.181 --> 00:28:00.120
<v Speaker 4>grass fed myth that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

642
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what's kind of ironic about the</v>

643
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 4>film and people don't expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shocking.</v>

644
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 4>If human beings right now stopped</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing,</v>

645
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 4>I can for the population in the United</v>
<v Speaker 4>States state of 300 million,</v>

646
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 4>can we feed ourselves right now with how</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing it?</v>

647
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like business as normal?</v>

648
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Sustainably.</v>

649
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Not intro to perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

650
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.170
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

651
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.520
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of the United States,</v>

652
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:28.550
<v Speaker 3>lower 48 land is designated to raising</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals for food,</v>

653
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.920
<v Speaker 3>whether growing the 50%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

654
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No other wildlife.</v>

655
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

656
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.450
<v Speaker 3>so we've already passed that tipping</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where we're,</v>

657
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.820
<v Speaker 3>we're on ecological collapse so we can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue business as normal.</v>

658
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50% of it.</v>

659
00:28:42.071 --> 00:28:44.720
<v Speaker 3>When you say pass that tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why isn't it sustainable?</v>

660
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the simple fact that we're draining the</v>

661
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:51.140
<v Speaker 3>aquifers at extreme rates and the uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all aquifer large stock for North</v>

662
00:28:51.141 --> 00:28:53.360
<v Speaker 3>America drops by I think six feet per</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

663
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 3>50% of 55% of all water consumed in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States goes into animal</v>

664
00:28:58.341 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

665
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 3>so we're pumping ground waters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally unsustainable in California,</v>

666
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive drought,</v>

667
00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:05.270
<v Speaker 3>47% of cattle</v>

668
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.010
<v Speaker 4>as opposed to domestic is 5%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every single thing you do in your home,</v>

669
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.650
<v Speaker 4>all everything you do in their home is</v>
<v Speaker 4>only 5%.</v>

670
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.770
<v Speaker 4>And why a culture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>55% and we're talking about how we're in</v>

671
00:29:14.771 --> 00:29:16.570
<v Speaker 4>a drought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called uh,</v>

672
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

673
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 4>it's clearly the food and water shortage</v>
<v Speaker 4>shortage.</v>

674
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

675
00:29:20.351 --> 00:29:21.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's golf courses?</v>

676
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Golf course is less than 2%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's still a lot.</v>

677
00:29:25.391 --> 00:29:26.410
<v Speaker 4>It's over just for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

678
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.161
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

679
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Just for,</v>

680
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.050
<v Speaker 3>just for California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the,</v>

681
00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:31.010
<v Speaker 3>for the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even register as a percent.</v>

682
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.160
<v Speaker 4>So in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>5% is for humans.</v>

683
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Just 4% for plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>2% is for golf.</v>

684
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 50,</v>

685
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 4>55% for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's listen.</v>

686
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 4>Let's get rid of important</v>

687
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 2>shit first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of the golf,</v>

688
00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.531
<v Speaker 2>the song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

689
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 2>now we're down to 2%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a way better.</v>

690
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 2>That's your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

691
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one.</v>

692
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So water water's John was a big one with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge issue.</v>

693
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Alienation technology that's emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sadly that's really not a solution</v>

694
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 2>either because of how much energy goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

695
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And so the greenhouse gas emissions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are attributed to each gallon of water.</v>

696
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:07.110
<v Speaker 2>How about nuclear son?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do some nuclear desalination,</v>

697
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.700
<v Speaker 2>put it right on a fault line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

698
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.170
<v Speaker 2>another part of it is a top soil erosion</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading causes,</v>

699
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 2>topsoil erosion is from hoofed animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>grazing on animal on land that never had</v>

700
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:18.270
<v Speaker 2>hooked animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

701
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.960
<v Speaker 2>it's how we tilled soils to grow corn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and soy and Alfalfa.</v>

702
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 2>That's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

703
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 2>That you guys also addressed that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people aren't aware of,</v>

704
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 2>is that you can't just keep pulling it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same plant over and over again from</v>

705
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:33.454
<v Speaker 2>soil.</v>

706
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.130
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you deplete these farmlands.</v>

707
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.001
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

708
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named Dr Joel Wallach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever heard of</v>

709
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controversial character,</v>

710
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 2>but he had this fascinating book called</v>
<v Speaker 2>dead doctors.</v>

711
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about mineral deficiencies.</v>

712
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.670
<v Speaker 2>And about these farm lands in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States had been minerally deficient.</v>

713
00:30:49.671 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the 1930s and they'd been</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of it forever.</v>

714
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And so they have to supplement the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the farm,</v>

715
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 2>the ground with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with minerals.</v>

716
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>But it's barely enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

717
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for your health.</v>

718
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the kind of vegetables that you get</v>

719
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:05.090
<v Speaker 2>from those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

720
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not the healthiest.</v>

721
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.751
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

722
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some soil scientists are saying that</v>

723
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't have livable top soils in the</v>

724
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 2>next 50 years in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>because how we farm and they know that's</v>

725
00:31:14.981 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 2>a huge issue.</v>

726
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.121
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>what ends up happening to all of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>top soil runs off into streams and</v>

728
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 2>rivers and that's when it's flushed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the oceans.</v>

729
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 2>We have these massive dead zones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are completely devoid of life all from,</v>

730
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary cause it because of raising</v>

731
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:28.690
<v Speaker 2>animals that we have the greenhouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>gasses.</v>

732
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.720
<v Speaker 2>And then when 50% is cleared away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine 50% of that land reverts back to</v>

733
00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:35.020
<v Speaker 2>actual wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:40.021
<v Speaker 2>to actual the Fanta growing back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're talking crazy talking stop</v>

735
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.720
<v Speaker 2>factory farming and agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

736
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Just forest forest and a bunch of holes</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to be eaten.</v>

737
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Bark like that fucking survivor dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

738
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to happen,</v>

739
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think anybody knew that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>had happened.</v>

740
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of the problem of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary like this is it catches</v>

741
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

742
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.843
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

743
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did this happen?</v>

744
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to that.</v>

745
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 2>How did this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's one of the things that I've</v>

746
00:32:07.011 --> 00:32:09.550
<v Speaker 2>realized as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a bit about this,</v>

747
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 2>is there just no grownups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just a bunch of people that got</v>

748
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 2>older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're a little kid,</v>

749
00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you think that one day there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a grownup and you know,</v>

750
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

751
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be growing up as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's gonna make sense.</v>

752
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

753
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.690
<v Speaker 2>one day I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be all grown up.</v>

754
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get grown up and then you realize,</v>

755
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows what the fuck is going on</v>

756
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 2>and we're all operating on momentum and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>

757
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 2>their momentum of these greedy cunts has</v>
<v Speaker 2>created this environment where you can't</v>

758
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:41.101
<v Speaker 2>even talk about what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and you can't talk about how far</v>

759
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:45.840
<v Speaker 2>gone we are and we're so disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of us are just as long as we can go</v>

760
00:32:45.841 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 2>to the store and buy some food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have shit to think about.</v>

761
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

762
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 2>fucking game of thrones is on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time.</v>

763
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys have gotten away with it,</v>

764
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

765
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a crime that you're watching.</v>

766
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's like crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it should be crying.</v>

767
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are literally living in the largest</v>

768
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 5>mass extinction in the planet's ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen 65 million years ago when all the</v>

769
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 5>dinosaurs died off is nothing compared</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the rate of extinction we're seeing</v>

770
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are Those animals are all losers though.</v>

771
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 5>All losers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then also I heard that 90% of</v>

772
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:22.530
<v Speaker 5>everything that's ever lived as extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

773
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.013
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

774
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to keep animals around</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever?</v>

775
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Are they the perfect animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't they just go in a new thing comes</v>

776
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 2>in their place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Al's the one,</v>

777
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean intellectually I totally,</v>

778
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm ever,</v>

779
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 2>but if I was intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that ultimately,</v>

780
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing is happening a lot.</v>

781
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Life is taking place and it's moving at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this very strange,</v>

782
00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 2>bizarre pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that ethically though,</v>

783
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.030
<v Speaker 2>the one of the bigger issues of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PR maybe,</v>

784
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.610
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the biggest issue is how did we</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow,</v>

785
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws in place like laws where you can go</v>

786
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 2>to jail for filming cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

787
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.870
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>

788
00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:06.410
<v Speaker 2>as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as people that are living in the age of</v>

789
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 2>information of 2016 to deny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deny information shouldn't,</v>

790
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you buy a pair of pants at that pair</v>

791
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 2>of pants is made by fucking slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't,</v>

792
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you went to the pair of pants factory</v>

793
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 2>and you saw a guy whipping the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were making the pair of pants,</v>

794
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:25.310
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you want to be aware of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how is it any different?</v>

795
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 2>How is it any different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it any different than it's</v>

796
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:31.490
<v Speaker 2>illegal to film someone being cruel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

797
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.840
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up</v>

798
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.520
<v Speaker 5>cause people don't want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't want to see what they're</v>

799
00:34:35.521 --> 00:34:36.720
<v Speaker 5>doing to their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

800
00:34:36.721 --> 00:34:38.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're eating three times a day.</v>

801
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.200
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

802
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the big thing is,</v>

803
00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:43.650
<v Speaker 5>is that it's money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

804
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.860
<v Speaker 5>I think it's way more money than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't want to see it cause people</v>

805
00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:48.270
<v Speaker 5>say that to all all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

806
00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:49.890
<v Speaker 5>they see the film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they feel really inspired.</v>

807
00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:51.450
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like well what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

808
00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:52.950
<v Speaker 5>I should write my congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should,</v>

809
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to my legislators and that's great.</v>

810
00:34:55.501 --> 00:34:57.360
<v Speaker 5>If they think that's where the solutions</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to happen,</v>

811
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.070
<v Speaker 5>can we just do an ice bucket challenge</v>
<v Speaker 5>type thing?</v>

812
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now we know,</v>

813
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.390
<v Speaker 5>but it really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was going to come down to is that as</v>

814
00:35:03.391 --> 00:35:06.120
<v Speaker 5>long as this industry has money and has</v>
<v Speaker 5>the money to funnel into the government,</v>

815
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.230
<v Speaker 5>things are going to continue.</v>

816
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.450
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>

817
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.293
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's kind of,</v>

818
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.000
<v Speaker 5>it's undermining the baseline with that</v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

819
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we toured around with the film and</v>

820
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.173
<v Speaker 5>people talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

821
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.720
<v Speaker 5>the politicians are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

822
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.860
<v Speaker 5>are the bad ones are the anomia culture</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups are the bad ones,</v>

823
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.720
<v Speaker 5>the government and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once again,</v>

824
00:35:21.721 --> 00:35:23.700
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to those environmental</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups.</v>

825
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.020
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

826
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.470
<v Speaker 5>those are the ones that you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to be held accountable.</v>

827
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.250
<v Speaker 5>That's why they make their billions of</v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars collectively and they're not</v>

828
00:35:32.251 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they're there.</v>

829
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 5>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is the one that did animal</v>

830
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 5>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's doing their business,</v>

831
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're good businessmen.</v>

832
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 4>They got their lobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got the government,</v>

833
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:42.750
<v Speaker 4>they got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they own filtration now to these</v>

834
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 4>environmental groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing a good job.</v>

835
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 4>So how about pure hold people</v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable to step up what they're</v>

836
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 4>doing and hold themselves accountable</v>
<v Speaker 4>whilst rather than saying,</v>

837
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 4>screw you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screw you,</v>

838
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:52.831
<v Speaker 4>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say,</v>

839
00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look in the mirror and what can I do?</v>

840
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 4>What can I do to make a difference and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can I do with these environmental</v>

841
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:01.900
<v Speaker 4>groups that are actually palpable and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just from the making the film to</v>

842
00:36:01.901 --> 00:36:04.280
<v Speaker 4>actually now starting to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

843
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.820
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty cool they're finally doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

844
00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because if you look at</v>

845
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 2>the agriculture business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at factory farming business,</v>

847
00:36:11.841 --> 00:36:13.970
<v Speaker 2>like I was a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do look at just the raising of</v>

848
00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:17.060
<v Speaker 2>livestock in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gigantic diffusion of</v>

849
00:36:17.061 --> 00:36:22.061
<v Speaker 2>responsibility aspect to it all because</v>
<v Speaker 2>each person is one part of this enormous</v>

850
00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:25.760
<v Speaker 2>industry and this industry has existed</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they came along.</v>

851
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.810
<v Speaker 2>So you grow up and it seems normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everybody's buying steak at the</v>

852
00:36:29.811 --> 00:36:31.700
<v Speaker 2>butcher shop and everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.520
<v Speaker 2>getting their cows from this fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their milk from this store.</v>

854
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:38.450
<v Speaker 2>And it seems totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as you get older,</v>

855
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you become a part of that system</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

856
00:36:40.881 --> 00:36:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You start becoming a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you take on a job that is,</v>

857
00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:48.320
<v Speaker 2>is already exists and it's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a normal part of your community and</v>

858
00:36:48.321 --> 00:36:50.510
<v Speaker 2>your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

859
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.260
<v Speaker 2>you run into some problems and you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>some loans so you get alone and you</v>

860
00:36:54.261 --> 00:36:57.320
<v Speaker 2>expand your business and then you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with lobbyists and the</v>

861
00:36:57.321 --> 00:36:59.120
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists combine and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey listen,</v>

862
00:36:59.121 --> 00:37:03.650
<v Speaker 2>we've passed a new law that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal for people to film you while</v>

863
00:37:03.651 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 2>you're beating the fuck out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pigs.</v>

864
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.290
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

865
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

866
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long as they can't run me out of</v>

867
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:10.760
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got loans,</v>

868
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I got loans from the fucking government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to pay off and this is what a</v>

869
00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:15.081
<v Speaker 2>lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

870
00:37:15.081 --> 00:37:18.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not dealing with individuals that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are evil.</v>

871
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.140
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with almost like an evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>

872
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.440
<v Speaker 2>And the evil concept is to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take life and to turn it into something</v>

873
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.850
<v Speaker 2>that's profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to take life and to smash it into</v>

874
00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 2>the small space possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feed it the most fattening shit</v>

875
00:37:35.331 --> 00:37:38.240
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pump it full of whatever chemicals we</v>

876
00:37:38.241 --> 00:37:40.970
<v Speaker 2>have that make it grow quicker and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>chop it up.</v>

877
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.440
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

878
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 3>and I think it'd be in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't demonize people who are</v>

879
00:37:45.211 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 3>involved in this industry because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all trying to,</v>

880
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay the bills,</v>

881
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:50.310
<v Speaker 3>feed their families.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was a rancher.</v>

882
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like,</v>

883
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:52.680
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

884
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 3>these aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these aren't bad people.</v>

885
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 3>These are people caught up in a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

886
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a real good point to</v>

887
00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:59.290
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real good point to make.</v>

888
00:37:59.291 --> 00:38:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's made those laws is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>

889
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoever let that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why whoa,</v>

890
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.240
<v Speaker 2>that having that put into like this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

891
00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:09.700
<v Speaker 2>if you have people that are fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people that interrupt</v>

892
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:10.960
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

893
00:38:10.961 --> 00:38:14.020
<v Speaker 2>you've seen videos of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get in and they just fucking start</v>

894
00:38:14.021 --> 00:38:17.470
<v Speaker 2>screaming about meat is murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like this is not the place for it.</v>

895
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>

896
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:20.500
<v Speaker 2>you're interrupting people's business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

897
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.220
<v Speaker 2>you're making a moral judgment and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be right in your eyes,</v>

898
00:38:24.221 --> 00:38:26.510
<v Speaker 2>but in this person's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong and you're,</v>

899
00:38:26.511 --> 00:38:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking with their space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

900
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.370
<v Speaker 2>there's that.</v>

901
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what's interesting is,</v>

902
00:38:30.661 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people talk about,</v>

903
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a judgment of what other people</v>

904
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't condone that at all.</v>

905
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discussed in the film is what other</v>

906
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 2>people are doing with their choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>

907
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say someone's like,</v>

908
00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Vegan or vegetarian.</v>

909
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

910
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do what I want.</v>

911
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 2>You do what you would want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't judge me.</v>

912
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.021
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

913
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're destroying our wildlife.</v>

914
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.570
<v Speaker 2>You're destroying my future generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paying taxes for your hamburger.</v>

915
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:57.571
<v Speaker 2>Like in the film about the guy who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean denomix we're paying around on him</v>

916
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 2>on a big Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it $7 normally costs,</v>

917
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>it costs about $3.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Pecans 10 it would cost $10.</v>

918
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Yet we are the ones paying the taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this with,</v>

919
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 2>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

920
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 2>but do you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying that to people and talking to</v>

921
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 2>them like that makes people think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans are annoying,</v>

922
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:20.911
<v Speaker 2>which makes it baffled because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are annoying.</v>

923
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a percentage of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying for no,</v>

924
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 2>no getting around it.</v>

925
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And when you ever met somebody who just</v>
<v Speaker 2>started fucking doing something like,</v>

926
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

927
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>just started playing tennis and all they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do is talk about fucking tennis.</v>

928
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Like Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

929
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>enough about fucking tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how a lot of people are with</v>

930
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:42.130
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including becoming a Vegan.</v>

931
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty of it with sting.</v>

932
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Things that I get into because when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into things,</v>

933
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that's all I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When when people find that moral high</v>

934
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:53.470
<v Speaker 2>ground in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to fucking plant the flag and</v>

935
00:39:53.471 --> 00:39:56.200
<v Speaker 2>blow trumpets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you say to someone,</v>

936
00:39:56.201 --> 00:39:56.771
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not because I'm paying taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your burger.</v>

938
00:39:58.571 --> 00:39:59.171
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>

939
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

940
00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:02.860
<v Speaker 2>this is not the way to talk to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they don't want to hear it.</v>

941
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making sense with your facts and</v>

942
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:07.054
<v Speaker 2>your statistics.</v>

943
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

944
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:12.760
<v Speaker 2>if they haven't seen your documentary or</v>
<v Speaker 2>many other documentaries where it's food</v>

945
00:40:12.761 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 2>inc or whether it's king corn or whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a series of them you can watch</v>

946
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:22.441
<v Speaker 2>it sort of give you this complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multifaceted Pete picture of what's</v>

947
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 2>going on with food in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>

948
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real bad on all levels because</v>

949
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.250
<v Speaker 2>that's what people really love the film</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we,</v>

950
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 2>we don't say one thing to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

951
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 2>when you watch the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't make one judgment.</v>

952
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:41.050
<v Speaker 2>We don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one point in pointing the entire</v>

953
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:42.640
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just following my journey,</v>

954
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 2>what I personally went through about six</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

955
00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 2>because it's all about providing</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

956
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Even that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

957
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.290
<v Speaker 2>just providing information about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>

958
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:50.861
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the truth.</v>

960
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.150
<v Speaker 2>It just know the information and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your own choices.</v>

961
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

962
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have to put a spin on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

963
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.261
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

964
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.700
<v Speaker 2>when you break down the actual numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as account,</v>

965
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that was incredible when</v>

966
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you show like how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

967
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.610
<v Speaker 2>area you need to grow plants versus how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much area you need to grow livestock to</v>

968
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:13.220
<v Speaker 2>feed the same amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

969
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about one 600 acre to feed a Vegan</v>

970
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:18.850
<v Speaker 2>for a year and then it's 18 times that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so skinny.</v>

971
00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look tiny.</v>

972
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Got To have the 300 pound Vegan in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

973
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.930
<v Speaker 2>These dudes eating pizza all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

974
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:28.180
<v Speaker 2>when you flying over the country and</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the extra spot,</v>

975
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put the fuck's going on with that</v>

976
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you fly over,</v>

977
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>it was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened for a long time,</v>

978
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 3>which is actually is kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

979
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 3>especially in the American West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd drive through Nevada and you're</v>

980
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:39.021
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

981
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 3>there's all this open space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you stopped cows there,</v>

982
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.261
<v Speaker 3>but she stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

983
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:44.060
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's one cow every hundred acres.</v>

984
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is land that the US has been very</v>

985
00:41:48.141 --> 00:41:51.150
<v Speaker 3>efficient at utilizing this land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was going on with</v>

986
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 2>that whole Bundy ranch thing that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to do with ranchers and public land</v>

987
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:57.500
<v Speaker 2>for grazing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

988
00:41:57.501 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Like the one wanted to charge them more</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and so they fucking got together</v>

989
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 2>with her white supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allegedly or they rights premises.</v>

990
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're definitely the white elliot.</v>

991
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 3>What is the Lgma Mormon might as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're mormons with guns.</v>

992
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.680
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guns for [inaudible].</v>

993
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when he was the Mormons in the U s we</v>

994
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 3>have federal lands that's managed by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bureau of Land Management Blm.</v>

995
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And that land belongs to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can get a permit to mine on that</v>

996
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hunt and fish and shoot guns and</v>

997
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.860
<v Speaker 3>ride atvs and all that sort of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just all in by all of us.</v>

998
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can also get a permit to grace</v>

999
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 3>livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so ranchers get these permits,</v>

1000
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 3>grave livestock on federal lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pay a fraction of what they would</v>

1001
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Speaker 3>normally pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that basically subsidized by all of</v>

1002
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:43.410
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1003
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.520
<v Speaker 3>and so then Bundy and his cronies all</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to,</v>

1004
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 3>they say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1005
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 3>they hadn't paid their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their basically their fees.</v>

1006
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 3>And so blm took their cattle and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1007
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:54.720
<v Speaker 3>you haven't paid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.390
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically stealing from the u s</v>

1009
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.471
<v Speaker 3>citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1010
00:42:57.471 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>by grazing animals illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they did their whole crew and you</v>

1011
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to overthrow the government</v>

1012
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 3>lemon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1013
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.121
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1014
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:05.841
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

1015
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:08.360
<v Speaker 3>and what's going on right now in Oregon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and same sort of thing is that they,</v>

1016
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 3>they believe that this land is for them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to use because no one else is up there.</v>

1017
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 3>And so they can graze their cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1018
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 3>well right now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're cutting down fences and wildlife</v>

1019
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 3>refuges to graze cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1020
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't benefit ecology and anyway,</v>

1021
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.510
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't benefit us as people first</v>

1022
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.880
<v Speaker 2>one to call those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'all Qaeda something,</v>

1023
00:43:27.881 --> 00:43:31.950
<v Speaker 2>someone did it on the podcast allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who it was.</v>

1024
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.040
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like something Tony would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not really political,</v>

1025
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.870
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he would be aware of the</v>

1026
00:43:36.871 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Bundy ranch thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Kinda,</v>

1027
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's been on twitter for a while and</v>

1028
00:43:41.071 --> 00:43:44.610
<v Speaker 2>someone attributed to someone who was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guest on this show and I don't remember</v>

1029
00:43:44.611 --> 00:43:46.110
<v Speaker 2>who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it had happened,</v>

1030
00:43:46.111 --> 00:43:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I would like to give them credit cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hilarious.</v>

1031
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So those ranchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do have huge power though right now</v>

1032
00:43:54.871 --> 00:43:57.390
<v Speaker 2>there's wild horses in American west</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being rounded up.</v>

1033
00:43:57.391 --> 00:44:00.270
<v Speaker 2>There's more wild horses in federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>captivity then there are free on the</v>

1034
00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:00.811
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1035
00:44:00.811 --> 00:44:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1036
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I found that to be fascinating too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a part of your pot.</v>

1037
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.920
<v Speaker 2>You're a documentary that I totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect.</v>

1038
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's again,</v>

1039
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.450
<v Speaker 2>because of the cattle industry now this</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal land,</v>

1040
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.200
<v Speaker 2>that's when you say that they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get their animals can graze on it</v>

1041
00:44:16.201 --> 00:44:18.570
<v Speaker 2>for a fraction of the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1042
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.190
<v Speaker 2>fraction of the cost of doing it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>private land.</v>

1043
00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So what you mean exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but federal land is owned by all the</v>

1044
00:44:24.691 --> 00:44:26.910
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so shouldn't it be kind of a fraction of</v>

1045
00:44:26.911 --> 00:44:31.320
<v Speaker 2>the cost if you do hand out permits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to like you could that</v>

1046
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:33.240
<v Speaker 2>land to go camping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hike,</v>

1047
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 2>to do cause it's all this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well Theodore Roosevelt,</v>

1048
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 2>when he was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very controversial because one of</v>

1049
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 2>the things that he did is he wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>protect gigantic chunks of land in this</v>

1050
00:44:45.361 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>country and make them public land and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so that people will always have</v>

1051
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 2>the great outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could always go and enjoy these.</v>

1052
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.170
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't overdeveloped them.</v>

1053
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a very amazing foresight in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1054
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 2>in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really saw the future and a lot of</v>

1055
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:01.950
<v Speaker 2>ways and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd been trying to fucking sell that</v>

1056
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 2>shit off forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as recently as,</v>

1057
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just one of those guys running for</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Ryan.</v>

1058
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Paul Ryan said his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he was one of the guys that</v>

1059
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 2>was ahead of this idea to sell that</v>
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>

1060
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.100
<v Speaker 2>to pay off the debt that the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States allegedly has to some fucking</v>

1061
00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:22.980
<v Speaker 2>invisible man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even understand the depth that</v>

1062
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to who?</v>

1063
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on the federal bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it called the Federal Bank?</v>

1064
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it a federal thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1065
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1066
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We owe,</v>

1067
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 2>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we owe that much?</v>

1068
00:45:33.061 --> 00:45:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Why are we paying them that much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we paying them for?</v>

1069
00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make money.</v>

1070
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't make our own fucking money.</v>

1071
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can go down a rabbit hole.</v>

1072
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.830
<v Speaker 2>My point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you do go down that rabbit hole,</v>

1073
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 2>like shouldn't those people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you,</v>

1074
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 2>if you have chickens Shinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow your chickens to fucking run</v>

1075
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:49.464
<v Speaker 2>around on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1076
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 2>on public land.</v>

1077
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.550
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the difference is profiting off of</v>

1078
00:45:52.551 --> 00:45:53.990
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's if they haven't,</v>

1079
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're private industry making money on</v>

1080
00:45:56.781 --> 00:45:58.550
<v Speaker 3>public lands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do pay taxes,</v>

1081
00:45:58.551 --> 00:45:59.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1082
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually taxes.</v>

1083
00:46:00.651 --> 00:46:02.540
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like they do it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1084
00:46:02.541 --> 00:46:06.380
<v Speaker 3>but they're heavily subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But back to that whole big Mac thing,</v>

1085
00:46:06.381 --> 00:46:08.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's $3 but it's really should be around</v>

1086
00:46:08.841 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 3>10</v>

1087
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.010
<v Speaker 2>well sort of because it's all money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to the government,</v>

1088
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they taking money from you.</v>

1089
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Are you really paying taxes from it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they paying less taxes?</v>

1090
00:46:16.721 --> 00:46:19.060
<v Speaker 2>You could say that you're paying taxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

1091
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's really that they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

1092
00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.170
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is actually mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Received checks.</v>

1093
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like they get like the oil</v>

1094
00:46:24.551 --> 00:46:26.200
<v Speaker 3>industry does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get subsidized.</v>

1095
00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.610
<v Speaker 3>So like the corn industry does to huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which apparently they can't survive</v>

1096
00:46:30.611 --> 00:46:31.670
<v Speaker 3>without that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1097
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna pick the hog industry in North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina.</v>

1098
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've read a report that said they</v>

1099
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.930
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be able to survive here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't people that of subsidies,</v>

1100
00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.390
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how does that happen?</v>

1101
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Explain key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you can,</v>

1102
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.390
<v Speaker 3>can you explain that to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1103
00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:46.690
<v Speaker 3>so what it is is that the US government</v>
<v Speaker 3>has policies around food.</v>

1104
00:46:46.691 --> 00:46:48.490
<v Speaker 3>That food has to be affordable for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>citizens.</v>

1105
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge thing.</v>

1106
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to come to the revolution</v>
<v Speaker 3>from happening?</v>

1107
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Definitely keep people well fed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have that what it is fucking</v>

1108
00:46:54.521 --> 00:46:57.130
<v Speaker 3>government man keeping us fat and lazy.</v>

1109
00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh well you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what happened in the Arab spring</v>

1110
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.160
<v Speaker 3>that was mostly because of food prices</v>
<v Speaker 3>lease.</v>

1111
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.510
<v Speaker 3>A lot of economists are saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.670
<v Speaker 3>but so we want to keep food affordable</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the u s so when a industry is</v>

1113
00:47:09.671 --> 00:47:12.070
<v Speaker 3>struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government stepped in and said,</v>

1114
00:47:12.071 --> 00:47:12.940
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll help you out.</v>

1115
00:47:12.941 --> 00:47:15.490
<v Speaker 3>We'll keep food prices artificially low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like corn for example,</v>

1116
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.260
<v Speaker 3>have huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge subsidies to it.</v>

1117
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.690
<v Speaker 3>70% of corn in the United States has fed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to livestock.</v>

1118
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So that subsidy is then passed onto the</v>
<v Speaker 3>livestock industry.</v>

1119
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.240
<v Speaker 3>You have industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a hog industry has,</v>

1120
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a porcine epidemic where all these</v>

1121
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 3>sounds dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1122
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 5>so the US government bails him out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

1123
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:32.494
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

1124
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$10 billion to get your industry out of,</v>

1125
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of deep water.</v>

1126
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that stuff happens all the time.</v>

1127
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 5>But then that's to make sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>food supply stays adequate.</v>

1128
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.580
<v Speaker 5>Cause I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>

1129
00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 5>chicken in the United States is cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like astronomically cheaper than it was</v>

1130
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 5>50 years ago even.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even including inflation,</v>

1131
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1132
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was one of,</v>

1133
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:57.480
<v Speaker 5>I believe Roosevelt's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1134
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 5>I think it was roosevelt with his</v>
<v Speaker 5>campaign slogans was a chicken in every</v>

1135
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:03.460
<v Speaker 5>pot because chickens were like lobster</v>
<v Speaker 5>back then.</v>

1136
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.040
<v Speaker 5>It was like really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if that was,</v>

1137
00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.800
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

1138
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that animal was a,</v>

1139
00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 5>a wealthy person's meall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1140
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's become the standard.</v>

1141
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 5>And then the reason for this is it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>artificially low.</v>

1142
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.453
<v Speaker 5>Hoover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.690
<v Speaker 5>Hoover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those old dead dudes.</v>

1144
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.730
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1145
00:48:22.731 --> 00:48:25.620
<v Speaker 5>that's just one aspect of it is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1146
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 5>cause people will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd be like,</v>

1147
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.610
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1148
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.860
<v Speaker 5>it's really expensive to eat plant based</v>
<v Speaker 5>foods.</v>

1149
00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:31.330
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've traveled around the world,</v>

1150
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:33.910
<v Speaker 5>I've lived around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plant based foods are the cheapest foods</v>

1151
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:37.720
<v Speaker 5>around the world except for in young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extreme remote areas where they can't</v>

1152
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 5>grow vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1153
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 5>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason why you can buy a 99 cent</v>

1154
00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 5>hamburger though is because of federal</v>
<v Speaker 5>subsidies,</v>

1155
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1156
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 5>so subsidies that keep food prices low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's part of the problem.</v>

1157
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:55.770
<v Speaker 5>I agree that it's probably a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep food prices low because people</v>

1158
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 5>don't make so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you go down that rabbit hole.</v>

1159
00:48:58.301 --> 00:48:58.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

1160
00:48:58.711 --> 00:49:00.070
<v Speaker 5>How can people who don't make so much</v>
<v Speaker 5>money?</v>

1161
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.530
<v Speaker 5>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is the fucking minimum wage so low?</v>

1162
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.570
<v Speaker 5>How the hell you live on that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't live on that.</v>

1163
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 5>You really can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when we interviewed,</v>

1164
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:09.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lauren or Nellis from food empowerment</v>

1165
00:49:09.251 --> 00:49:10.600
<v Speaker 5>project,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's one of the things they talk</v>

1166
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:11.670
<v Speaker 5>about is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1167
00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:14.920
<v Speaker 5>we look at food deserts that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>happening in and around urban areas.</v>

1168
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 5>People can't afford food and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we don't have a living wage.</v>

1169
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 5>It's like you want to solve food</v>
<v Speaker 5>deserts,</v>

1170
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 5>please?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a food desert.</v>

1171
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.920
<v Speaker 5>Areas that don't have access to fresh</v>
<v Speaker 5>foods.</v>

1172
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:24.611
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1173
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:28.390
<v Speaker 5>you look at a community and they're only</v>
<v Speaker 5>grocery store is a liquor store that has</v>

1174
00:49:28.391 --> 00:49:30.400
<v Speaker 5>chips and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>junk food.</v>

1175
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.121
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1176
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 5>So you're just talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods,</v>

1177
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest part about going to poor</v>

1178
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods is how many fucking liquor</v>
<v Speaker 5>stores,</v>

1179
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:40.901
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1180
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>

1181
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:45.040
<v Speaker 5>the federal subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they're not subsidizing</v>

1182
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 5>healthy fruits and vegetables.</v>

1183
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1184
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 5>the organic fruits and vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 5>industries aren't heavily subsidized.</v>

1185
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 5>They're not subsides even at all for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>

1186
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.600
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1187
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 5>they subsidizing really unhealthy foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high fructose corn syrup,</v>

1188
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal products,</v>

1189
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.010
<v Speaker 5>foods that are actually killing us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1190
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 5>that was another super disturbing part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of king corn when they went over their</v>

1191
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:07.210
<v Speaker 5>own bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got their bodies examined and found</v>

1192
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 5>out how much of the carbon in their body</v>
<v Speaker 5>had come from corn to there were made</v>

1193
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 5>out of fucking corn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they go through the supermarket</v>

1194
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 5>aisle and examine all the different</v>
<v Speaker 5>products to find evidence of corn</v>

1195
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.810
<v Speaker 5>products in them and look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1196
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:24.460
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a har how does happen in a hundred</v>

1197
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.630
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a hundred years.</v>

1198
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go back to 1915</v>

1199
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and everything was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were eating normal shit,</v>

1200
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1201
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 2>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were the farms where normal people</v>

1202
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 2>get their milk delivered to their door</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning,</v>

1203
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a glass jug that came from a farm.</v>

1204
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was normal.</v>

1205
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.780
<v Speaker 2>I remember somewhere along the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.900
<v Speaker 2>well it really came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from War World War One and World War Two</v>

1207
00:50:45.901 --> 00:50:47.420
<v Speaker 2>is they started producing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 2>chemical nitrogen for mustard gas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>for chemical weapons and they realize,</v>

1209
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:52.881
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:55.430
<v Speaker 2>you can grow plants with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows the story behind that.</v>

1211
00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

1212
00:50:56.270 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 2>The hopper method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy became a fucking war criminal.</v>

1213
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 2>The guy who invented the nitrogen that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for like 50% of the fucking</v>

1214
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen in your body right now has come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the hopper method where they take</v>

1215
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's had some bizarre way of extracting</v>

1216
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:17.090
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen from the air because the air is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nitrogen rich.</v>

1217
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 2>So instead of using fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out how to get nitrogen out</v>

1218
00:51:20.271 --> 00:51:22.670
<v Speaker 2>of the fucking air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This same guy came up with the idea of</v>

1219
00:51:22.671 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 2>gassing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gassed the allied troops in World War</v>

1220
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:32.051
<v Speaker 2>One and then created xy clon be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking gas that they will,</v>

1221
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 2>these xy Klein a and Zyklon b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he came up with Zyklon a and he</v>

1222
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:40.190
<v Speaker 2>figured out a way to make it so it has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong smell.</v>

1223
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 2>So you would know it was a pesticide so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would know that you,</v>

1224
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 2>if you smelled it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from it.</v>

1225
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And then the Nazis turned into Zyklon b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just took out whatever element</v>

1226
00:51:50.511 --> 00:51:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that gave it a horrible smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a Jew.</v>

1227
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And that sick dark story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all happened after he was,</v>

1228
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1229
00:51:59.281 --> 00:52:01.130
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it happened after he was dead,</v>

1230
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:01.851
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1231
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis using Zyklon b.</v>

1232
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.950
<v Speaker 2>But while he was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1233
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:07.701
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1234
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 2>he was like a man without a country and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

1235
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd given him a fucking Nobel prize.</v>

1236
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And then they wanted to try him as a war</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal at the same time.</v>

1237
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1238
00:52:18.041 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the weirdest stories ever in</v>
<v Speaker 2>science for sure.</v>

1239
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically how we got to where</v>

1240
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can offer sudden grow corn</v>

1241
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and places that you could never grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>foods before.</v>

1242
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.860
<v Speaker 2>If anybody wants to hear more about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1243
00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a radio lab podcast on it.</v>

1244
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Go check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember the name of it,</v>

1245
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but if you google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it do?</v>

1246
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.010
<v Speaker 2>You just say something right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how you solve a problem.</v>

1247
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a topper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's called,</v>

1248
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.340
<v Speaker 2>it might've been more than one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was the bad show.</v>

1249
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1250
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the actual pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way you'll,</v>

1251
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:53.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll find it folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth listening to if you're</v>

1252
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't heard of radio lab,</v>

1253
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking amazing podcast for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1254
00:52:58.221 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1255
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a big reason why.</v>

1256
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now we have,</v>

1257
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what a lot of population to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explode.</v>

1258
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture really is what lot of</v>

1259
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 2>populations to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like once we started cultivating</v>

1260
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations,</v>

1261
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:12.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not spending 90% of our time</v>

1262
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.690
<v Speaker 2>hunting and gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that the pill,</v>

1263
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.840
<v Speaker 2>the birth control pill didn't put up</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Denton.</v>

1264
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even know there was like throwing</v>

1265
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:22.130
<v Speaker 2>up some cheese cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to stop a raging river.</v>

1266
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just didn't do Jack Shit.</v>

1267
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 2>They thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1268
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have this down now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I have does take a pill.</v>

1269
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1270
00:53:30.471 --> 00:53:32.100
<v Speaker 2>we'll figure that out just in the nick</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

1271
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.223
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1272
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no pill.</v>

1273
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Probably be the same amount of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably stupid as fuck.</v>

1274
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the real,</v>

1275
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 2>the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to control populations,</v>

1276
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>educate girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it comes down to.</v>

1277
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't work Saturdays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ people do educate boys.</v>

1278
00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't some,</v>

1279
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.300
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely can't put it on girls cause</v>

1280
00:53:50.301 --> 00:53:52.470
<v Speaker 2>they get horny just like boys get</v>
<v Speaker 2>baffled.</v>

1281
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.760
<v Speaker 2>But in mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing and said,</v>

1282
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:56.370
<v Speaker 2>you look at populations whose birth the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rates are going down.</v>

1283
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.170
<v Speaker 2>It's when they started educating girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1284
00:53:58.171 --> 00:54:00.750
<v Speaker 2>when they stop segregating were only</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys were going to school.</v>

1285
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Just one correlation though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also populations go down in</v>

1286
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:06.840
<v Speaker 2>places that are more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1287
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 2>more advanced and places that a or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high population areas with more uh,</v>

1288
00:54:12.281 --> 00:54:13.260
<v Speaker 2>affluent people.</v>

1289
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Populations go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were there more career oriented</v>

1290
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>populations go down.</v>

1291
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so there's a lot of different</v>

1292
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 2>factors in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1293
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have to be edited on chicks.</v>

1294
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1295
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:23.471
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1296
00:54:23.471 --> 00:54:25.230
<v Speaker 2>it's the fact that we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 2>What do we have 50 kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're a fucking whore.</v>

1298
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.730
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1299
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.570
<v Speaker 2>well I mean old woman who's got an</v>
<v Speaker 2>education isn't,</v>

1300
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.030
<v Speaker 2>isn't concerned about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 2>having 10 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's interested in having a career.</v>

1302
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I come from a family of eight</v>

1304
00:54:40.351 --> 00:54:41.300
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

1305
00:54:41.301 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about human population all day</v>

1306
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.260
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are goofing.</v>

1307
00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.151
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucking,</v>

1308
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Speaker 2>they make people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just ridiculous.</v>

1309
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 2>At this point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex is the only way to make people like,</v>

1310
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should figure out a way better and</v>

1311
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 2>more obvious way to make people than do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that your body is urging you</v>

1312
00:54:56.701 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1313
00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 2>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make what do we amoebas and like God</v>

1314
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:01.130
<v Speaker 2>damn gets get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we,</v>

1315
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1316
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 2>even as important as factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out a way where it's completely</v>

1317
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>sober and non pleasurable to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person</v>

1318
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 2>where it's not like a desire like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro,</v>

1319
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.630
<v Speaker 2>like you've been holding your breath for</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>

1320
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:20.070
<v Speaker 2>just like that's what it's like with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they have sex.</v>

1321
00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Just such a fucking overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

1322
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you make a person that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathetic to biological trick of the</v>

1323
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:29.820
<v Speaker 2>highest order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature is a trickster and dirty</v>

1324
00:55:29.821 --> 00:55:31.630
<v Speaker 2>trickster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1325
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1326
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that's at least something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed and people talk about one,</v>

1327
00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I think I find the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing about all this is how few</v>

1328
00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:45.300
<v Speaker 2>people are aware of the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory farming.</v>

1329
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 2>It sorta seems like a ghost that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>whispered in the woods,</v>

1330
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory farming.</v>

1331
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1332
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 2>No one really thinks about it too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not really in our face</v>

1333
00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that that now is covered by</v>

1334
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 2>the Patriot Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do put it in people's faces that</v>

1335
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.380
<v Speaker 2>you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially like by way of creating</v>

1336
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 2>a law like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've made it so that you'll never</v>

1337
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:09.690
<v Speaker 2>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no need to make it better.</v>

1338
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as there's no need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>improve the conditions that these</v>

1339
00:56:12.721 --> 00:56:16.170
<v Speaker 2>animals live under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just not going to get better.</v>

1340
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.230
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't help being businesses</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't operate that way,</v>

1341
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help profits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to get back.</v>

1342
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing though with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1343
00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again the film,</v>

1344
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the factory farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>

1345
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:30.770
<v Speaker 2>It's with a population as big as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way to feed this meat</v>

1346
00:56:30.771 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 2>consumption and dairy with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1347
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demand.</v>

1348
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 2>But is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ultimately is the move to make</v>

1349
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 2>everybody vegetables or the move to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>less people?</v>

1350
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Can we just start killing stupid people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we just like have a pole?</v>

1351
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>How old is your earth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's more than 10.</v>

1352
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Less than 10,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You win a prize and we have them all</v>

1353
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 2>show up and just push him into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>volcano.</v>

1354
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1355
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:56.650
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't work,</v>

1356
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's like who chooses that some Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit right there.</v>

1357
00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had to choose.</v>

1358
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's looking at both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can't ignore population when</v>

1359
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:06.560
<v Speaker 2>talking about sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1360
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 2>they go hand in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think having a very honest,</v>

1361
00:57:09.791 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 2>serious conversation about human</v>
<v Speaker 2>population is very important.</v>

1362
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no real,</v>

1363
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical way to control population that I</v>

1364
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>know of right now.</v>

1365
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.340
<v Speaker 2>And so we have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do we feed people while we also</v>

1366
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:22.340
<v Speaker 2>educate them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1367
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 2>cause I take it serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I actually,</v>

1368
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I had myself sterilized on us 24 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old could move,</v>

1369
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:27.281
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:29.050
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the best decisions I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>made in my whole life.</v>

1371
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.470
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1372
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1373
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just looked at the situation,</v>

1374
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm care about sustainability and ma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to contribute to that.</v>

1375
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I want to live as sustainably as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1376
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 2>And then as far as feeding people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1377
00:57:39.431 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 2>one of the scientists on our film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said if everyone did just the</v>

1378
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:44.680
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that that would happen is that</v>

1379
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you could feed around fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 15 billion people.</v>

1380
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>It's 7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way we're eating right now,</v>

1381
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 2>we need two and a half planets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now we're screwed.</v>

1382
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more than a population issue.</v>

1383
00:57:57.671 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like what the population is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do people just lose weight?</v>

1384
00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 2>People are fat as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have everybody just stops eating so</v>

1385
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 2>much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we just drop it drastically?</v>

1386
00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 2>But if people ate enough to be lean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy like you're supposed to,</v>

1387
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.470
<v Speaker 2>what difference in the consumption would</v>
<v Speaker 2>that be?</v>

1388
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:12.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1389
00:58:12.031 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 2>it's how many calories go into per</v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie.</v>

1390
00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's a unit of energy that's a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>

1391
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So that's a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsustainability.</v>

1392
00:58:19.211 --> 00:58:24.211
<v Speaker 2>So the unsustainable bill on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability is the topsoil is eroded</v>

1393
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 2>to the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1394
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:31.090
<v Speaker 2>there's just not that much that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with it and at certain point in time</v>

1395
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 2>is going to become sterile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one part of the</v>

1396
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 2>unsustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other part of the</v>

1397
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:37.870
<v Speaker 2>unsustainability is that the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not staying the same and it's</v>

1398
00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:39.070
<v Speaker 2>continuing to jump up.</v>

1399
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I think in my lifetime the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>has gone up something like 60 million</v>

1400
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 2>plus people just in my lifetime I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be as bad as it was more than</v>

1401
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:48.011
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably,</v>

1402
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 2>it was more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably making sure it up.</v>

1403
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've watched a film the other day</v>

1404
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and it was a about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19,</v>

1405
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I guess 1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 1960s.</v>

1406
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 2>And they were driving around and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cars and there's fucking nobody on</v>

1407
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:02.824
<v Speaker 2>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1408
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get anywhere.</v>

1409
00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 2>You could just drive around and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch and you're like,</v>

1410
00:59:08.321 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1411
00:59:09.491 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Look at everyone just driving like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>no traffic jam.</v>

1412
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Did he even know what a traffic jam was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you look 60 years later or</v>

1413
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.330
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts.</v>

1414
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Like now it's just a sworn and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to extrapolate,</v>

1415
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's going to happen in a hundred</v>

1416
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 2>years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that going to be like?</v>

1417
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they're,</v>

1418
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.460
<v Speaker 5>they're expecting 9 billion people by</v>
<v Speaker 5>2050.</v>

1419
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and those are people all,</v>

1420
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.490
<v Speaker 5>all we're going to want to eat and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1421
00:59:35.491 --> 00:59:37.910
<v Speaker 5>that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have like apartment</v>

1422
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:40.650
<v Speaker 5>buildings stacked up with cows and side</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them so that they're going to</v>

1423
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 5>eventually do in Japan actually there</v>
<v Speaker 5>really speed that up and they do it.</v>

1424
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 5>That's always fucked up when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous idea that you don't think</v>

1425
00:59:48.951 --> 00:59:50.180
<v Speaker 5>anyone's ever going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they go,</v>

1426
00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're already doing that Japanese one</v>

1427
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 5>step ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And usually,</v>

1428
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.380
<v Speaker 5>well they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have that wide you fucking cow</v>

1429
00:59:57.381 --> 01:00:00.230
<v Speaker 5>thing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I had never understand why people</v>

1430
01:00:00.231 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 5>want to pay all that money for a cow</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's basically like a job at the hut</v>

1431
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 5>cow that's like going to die like</v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies.</v>

1432
01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 5>Just riddled with fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

1433
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 5>you look at that meet and it's just like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that animal is sick.</v>

1434
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 5>That is a sick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sick animal that's super unhealthy.</v>

1435
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so juicy though.</v>

1436
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 5>It's still delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the best.</v>

1437
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.720
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the big thing there too though about</v>

1438
01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 5>like the sustainability is the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're clearing forests to graze cattle.</v>

1439
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:30.740
<v Speaker 5>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're 91% of the Amazon destruction has</v>

1440
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 5>been in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has been associated with grazing</v>

1441
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:34.010
<v Speaker 5>cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The um,</v>

1442
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.070
<v Speaker 5>the assassinations too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the other thing that you guys</v>

1443
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 5>covered when you showed that none who</v>
<v Speaker 5>got taken out by the cattle industry</v>

1444
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 5>allegedly down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

1445
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

1446
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean the shot a none.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>

1447
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 5>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she spoke out against the cattle</v>

1448
01:00:47.871 --> 01:00:50.330
<v Speaker 5>industry because they killed was a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary on her.</v>

1449
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dorothy standing at this thing and like</v>

1450
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:55.130
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Hitman who was paid by a rancher to</v>

1451
01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 5>kill her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went to prison for what?</v>

1452
01:00:56.901 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 5>One year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two years tried and then he got laid</v>

1453
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:00.520
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was good documentary on him.</v>

1454
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:05.160
<v Speaker 5>Over a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over a thousand forced activists have</v>

1455
01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.540
<v Speaker 5>been killed in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And just what the past 20</v>

1456
01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.373
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

1457
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm this guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who uh,</v>

1458
01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:12.460
<v Speaker 2>paid him off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he get in trouble?</v>

1459
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.710
<v Speaker 2>The guy who paid for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hitman.</v>

1460
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they name him?</v>

1461
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a while ago.</v>

1463
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>But it's really good and just shows how</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt it is.</v>

1464
01:01:21.191 --> 01:01:22.540
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Well Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to poverty,</v>

1466
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a totally different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been well,</v>

1467
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.301
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1468
01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>this is my fee was my favorite favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>country and then making this film,</v>

1469
01:01:32.141 --> 01:01:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1470
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going there for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1471
01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not everyone.</v>

1472
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:38.980
<v Speaker 2>It's Brazil's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Brazil.</v>

1473
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1474
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there probably six times.</v>

1475
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>The people are so friendly and so happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so proud to be Brazilian.</v>

1476
01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they love that you enjoy Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whenever you have poverty,</v>

1477
01:01:52.481 --> 01:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he uses a lot of haves and have nots in</v>

1478
01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Brazil.</v>

1479
01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a extreme poverty and extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth and there's,</v>

1480
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.560
<v Speaker 2>it's weird when you go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and you see really high</v>

1481
01:02:02.561 --> 01:02:04.690
<v Speaker 2>fences with barbed wire around them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1482
01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:05.524
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1483
01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>like this is a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of crazy.</v>

1484
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these like these really nice houses that</v>

1485
01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:12.730
<v Speaker 2>are protected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a prison,</v>

1486
01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unfortunate.</v>

1487
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.840
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1488
01:02:16.841 --> 01:02:19.270
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assassinations and everything,</v>

1489
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're having in Brazil,</v>

1490
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>it's all people that are trying to stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deforestation of the rain forest,</v>

1491
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:28.060
<v Speaker 2>which is unbelievably devastating to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tune of how,</v>

1492
01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one acre?</v>

1493
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:29.761
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long?</v>

1494
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:30.430
<v Speaker 2>A minute.</v>

1495
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:33.910
<v Speaker 4>It's up to one acre every second up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>every second.</v>

1496
01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Like a football field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of a whole football field every</v>

1497
01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.200
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

1498
01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:41.210
<v Speaker 4>So right now up to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it varies too.</v>

1499
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.740
<v Speaker 4>It varies depending on the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It went down for a few years and then</v>

1500
01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.890
<v Speaker 4>two acres a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then a few years ago it went down</v>

1501
01:02:47.891 --> 01:02:51.010
<v Speaker 4>and then they just released the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this law that made it go down.</v>

1502
01:02:51.011 --> 01:02:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Now they're backup back up again to</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it used to be.</v>

1503
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:58.030
<v Speaker 4>That's literally unconceivable and</v>
<v Speaker 4>inconceivable.</v>

1504
01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you look at the environmental</v>

1505
01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:01.930
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think this would be their</v>

1506
01:03:01.931 --> 01:03:02.980
<v Speaker 3>forefront issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1507
01:03:02.981 --> 01:03:07.420
<v Speaker 3>right now you go to any inbox or</v>
<v Speaker 3>rainforest action organization,</v>

1508
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.450
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be talking about palm</v>
<v Speaker 3>oil and pulp in timber and dams and</v>

1509
01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:15.760
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuels when still today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leading causes of rainforest</v>

1510
01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:17.540
<v Speaker 3>destruction around the world life is</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

1511
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1512
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 4>was anybody willing to talk to you guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that?</v>

1513
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.180
<v Speaker 4>Not In the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not Amazon much.</v>

1514
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:27.960
<v Speaker 4>Amazon Watch Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1515
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:30.870
<v Speaker 4>when it was kind of the turn of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to all these groups and then</v>

1516
01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:34.170
<v Speaker 4>finally it was this big long drawn out</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where she was kind of stumbling,</v>

1517
01:03:34.171 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 4>stumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stumbling.</v>

1518
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 4>Finally she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1519
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.660
<v Speaker 4>You're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1520
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:43.620
<v Speaker 4>this is screwed up and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why we're not talking about it.</v>

1521
01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:44.131
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1522
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:46.980
<v Speaker 4>these interviews are two hours long and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes we go to these,</v>

1523
01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 4>go to these screenings and you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone from Greenpeace or Sierra Club</v>

1524
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:50.971
<v Speaker 4>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1525
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:52.980
<v Speaker 4>you guys manipulated the editing of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>film.</v>

1526
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:53.814
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1527
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 4>you watched the full edits to the film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more bizarre.</v>

1528
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:58.880
<v Speaker 4>It's more of a cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was more fun.</v>

1529
01:03:58.881 --> 01:03:59.714
<v Speaker 4>You have that.</v>

1530
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Who was accusing of us was accusing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys of manipulating the data all the</v>

1531
01:04:03.421 --> 01:04:04.460
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we go on tour,</v>

1532
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.120
<v Speaker 4>some will stand up and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll say the,</v>

1533
01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.060
<v Speaker 4>the edits of our interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1534
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 4>that was the most bizarre part and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>most funniest part,</v>

1535
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.410
<v Speaker 4>they say you manipulated the edits to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it the most funny or the most,</v>

1536
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cover up and said,</v>

1537
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.830
<v Speaker 4>say no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you see the longer edit to that,</v>

1538
01:04:19.831 --> 01:04:22.620
<v Speaker 4>it's worse than it appears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you guys just put the long</v>

1539
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.680
<v Speaker 4>edits on Youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do,</v>

1540
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.950
<v Speaker 4>we've been doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

1541
01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been working on other stuff,</v>

1542
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:29.250
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>

1543
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1544
01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:33.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1545
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:37.490
<v Speaker 2>very disconcerting to think that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal rights at are these,</v>

1546
01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:38.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1547
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 2>green peace activists and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental activists and all these</v>

1548
01:04:40.821 --> 01:04:44.590
<v Speaker 2>different people that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this campaign to save the rain forest</v>

1549
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:48.710
<v Speaker 2>are also maybe even taking money from,</v>

1550
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:52.000
<v Speaker 3>you mean animal agriculture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

1551
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.700
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean her to say?</v>

1552
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's definitely,</v>

1553
01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.670
<v Speaker 3>there's links to shell that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these organizations do except</v>

1554
01:04:58.671 --> 01:05:02.210
<v Speaker 3>money straight from the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And World Wildlife Fund doesn't make any</v>

1555
01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:04.280
<v Speaker 3>qualms about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may get money from the,</v>

1556
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beef industry.</v>

1557
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you can also look at,</v>

1558
01:05:09.231 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's on their board,</v>

1559
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's their background?</v>

1560
01:05:11.811 --> 01:05:12.561
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1561
01:05:12.561 --> 01:05:14.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest in all fairness is that</v>

1562
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:15.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a massive industry.</v>

1563
01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 3>It's hard not to be associated them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some way or another.</v>

1564
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.211
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1565
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Greenpeace's largest grant on record</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from a guy who raises and</v>

1566
01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:25.300
<v Speaker 5>slaughters 40,000 animals for his</v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurants every year.</v>

1567
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:28.300
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to speak at bad about</v>

1568
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 5>an industry when one of your huge donors</v>
<v Speaker 5>is doing that?</v>

1569
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you decipher that?</v>

1570
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Because do you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1571
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 5>maybe this guy who slaughters all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals for his restaurants that Ted</v>

1572
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.340
<v Speaker 5>Turner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1573
01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.580
<v Speaker 5>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1574
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 5>maybe he really is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I said Ted Turner,</v>

1575
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 5>because I think he legitimately does</v>
<v Speaker 5>have concerns about the environment.</v>

1576
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:52.900
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a guy who really loves the</v>
<v Speaker 5>great outdoors.</v>

1577
01:05:52.901 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 5>He's massive ranches and it goes to them</v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

1578
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't doubt that these organizations</v>

1579
01:05:57.941 --> 01:05:59.990
<v Speaker 5>really believe in what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1580
01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 5>they want to help the environment and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do good work.</v>

1581
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:03.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the reason why we have a,</v>

1582
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I think a big part of why we have an</v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental movement in the United</v>

1583
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:09.880
<v Speaker 5>States is because of Greenpeace and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've opened doors to be able to talk</v>

1584
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:10.980
<v Speaker 5>about things and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>

1585
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm so thankful for that.</v>

1586
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 5>But to fail to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1587
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:15.140
<v Speaker 5>kip has an analogy about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1588
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.370
<v Speaker 5>the house on fire basically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1589
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.890
<v Speaker 5>imagine a house that's burning on fire</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's organization groups.</v>

1590
01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:22.360
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Sierra Club's writing for a section</v>

1591
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 5>at work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at green pieces.</v>

1592
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 5>They come houses on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them comes and cleans the window</v>

1593
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 5>cause it's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1594
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:32.100
<v Speaker 5>little dusty and other one dust counter</v>
<v Speaker 5>top one though those leaky faucet.</v>

1595
01:06:32.101 --> 01:06:35.620
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile there's a bonfire in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the House that's burning the</v>

1596
01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:37.160
<v Speaker 5>house down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a great analogy.</v>

1597
01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 5>And that's essentially what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 5>So I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are doing good work,</v>

1599
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.260
<v Speaker 5>but they're failing to address the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>destructive industry.</v>

1600
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.250
<v Speaker 5>Ted Turner's scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he have you say he slaughters all</v>

1601
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 5>these animals for his restaurants?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they his own animals?</v>

1602
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.360
<v Speaker 5>He has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he have ranches and he grows these</v>

1603
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:52.900
<v Speaker 5>cattle?</v>

1604
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1605
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 5>I think the second largest land owner in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States.</v>

1606
01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.120
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so he raises really?</v>

1607
01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:59.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1608
01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so therefore his restaurants,</v>

1609
01:07:01.481 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever they're called,</v>

1610
01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.370
<v Speaker 5>Ted's tag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called teds and they aren't all</v>

1611
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 5>wildlife preserves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1612
01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 5>their cow preserves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when he's growing these,</v>

1613
01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.880
<v Speaker 5>these cows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like is he doing it in a sustainable way</v>

1614
01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 5>and his property at least,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was he doing it.</v>

1615
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 5>He raises buffalo as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1616
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 5>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are going to raise animals for</v>

1617
01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:23.230
<v Speaker 5>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should be raising native species.</v>

1618
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think people should be raising</v>

1619
01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 5>animals is just super inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 16 pounds of input to get one</v>

1620
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.680
<v Speaker 5>pound out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1621
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:33.250
<v Speaker 5>but you could at least do an indigenous</v>
<v Speaker 5>species.</v>

1622
01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:35.530
<v Speaker 5>And so cow nonindigenous where's it come</v>
<v Speaker 5>from?</v>

1623
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1624
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:38.380
<v Speaker 5>American cows confirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.170
<v Speaker 5>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about that.</v>

1626
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.170
<v Speaker 5>Texans greet and Chinese food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what you think.</v>

1627
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 5>You think Merck and we'll sit down hill</v>
<v Speaker 5>at stake and then pure for pure</v>

1628
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 5>sustainability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most,</v>

1629
01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most sustainable way to grow is</v>

1630
01:07:52.361 --> 01:07:54.220
<v Speaker 5>through factory farms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're just talking,</v>

1631
01:07:54.221 --> 01:07:54.701
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1632
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:58.240
<v Speaker 5>not efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody factory farms buffalo,</v>

1633
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:03.300
<v Speaker 5>that seems like sin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird just seeing them in</v>

1634
01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.630
<v Speaker 5>supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1635
01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:07.720
<v Speaker 5>you can buy Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So bizarre wasn't that on the only one</v>

1636
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:09.960
<v Speaker 5>thing almost dead?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ones that was most,</v>

1637
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most bizarre thing was how many,</v>

1638
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy named Dan Flores that</v>

1639
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 5>wrote a thing about bison</v>

1640
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.590
<v Speaker 2>ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating and I'm kind of</v>

1641
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:19.730
<v Speaker 2>get him on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1642
01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:25.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ascertation is that the native</v>

1643
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just with the introduction of firearms</v>

1644
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 2>and horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have probably wiped the</v>

1645
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>buffalo out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even like,</v>

1646
01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:33.831
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:08:33.831 --> 01:08:38.831
<v Speaker 2>without the Americans are without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europeans landing and becoming a part of</v>

1648
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:40.880
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wouldn't happen as quick cause</v>

1649
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:43.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overall slaughter was fueled by</v>

1650
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:44.331
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1651
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:44.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1652
01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>the hide slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1653
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.320
<v Speaker 2>the amount of buffalo hides they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

1654
01:08:48.321 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>and this is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean we've all seen the stacks of bones.</v>

1655
01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:51.830
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1656
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 2>he believes that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1657
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 2>what had happened was there had been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive decline in the population of</v>

1658
01:08:58.071 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during that time,</v>

1659
01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 2>the buffalo grew to staggering</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportions that before that they had</v>

1660
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 2>kind of kept them in check more cause I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had eaten them.</v>

1661
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 2>But there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's like a 90% decline in</v>

1662
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 2>the populations of native Americans that</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably was linked to Europeans moving</v>

1663
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:18.380
<v Speaker 2>here and giving them diseases that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have immune systems for.</v>

1664
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating subject,</v>

1665
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:23.360
<v Speaker 2>obviously off of yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean guns,</v>

1666
01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 2>germs and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an awesome book.</v>

1667
01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Same similar sort of thing where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about that,</v>

1668
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:30.610
<v Speaker 2>that introduce technology to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>population and see what happens.</v>

1669
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.551
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1670
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:32.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flores is,</v>

1671
01:09:32.551 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 2>is it backs historical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recollections of,</v>

1672
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people who had come before the</v>

1673
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:41.630
<v Speaker 2>decline in native American populations</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they really didn't discuss bison</v>

1674
01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:43.700
<v Speaker 2>herds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't ever seen like these million</v>

1675
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:44.900
<v Speaker 2>herds of Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1676
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they described in the,</v>

1677
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:48.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 17 hundreds of people had gotten</v>

1678
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Speaker 2>there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1679
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Just thunderous hills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of an imbalanced as</v>

1680
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:55.940
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our idea of that being like,</v>

1681
01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:57.980
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a million buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

1682
01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 2>for a very short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a mistake.</v>

1683
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And that was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an imbalance that probably would have</v>

1684
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:05.720
<v Speaker 2>been corrected by the introduction of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns and horseback.</v>

1685
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>But Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>

1686
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 2>even more grass and who require even</v>
<v Speaker 2>more land than cow do.</v>

1687
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1689
01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:15.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I bet efficiency like</v>

1690
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 2>per pound of meat they put on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>bones,</v>

1691
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what they consume I counts are</v>

1692
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:21.980
<v Speaker 2>really efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1693
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.430
<v Speaker 2>but they just eat different things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they float too.</v>

1694
01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call evolved with the grasses.</v>

1695
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a reason why they call it</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo grass is cause buffalo's</v>

1696
01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:30.140
<v Speaker 2>actually he never heard of buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass.</v>

1697
01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like what the prayer is used</v>

1698
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>to be covered in was the buffalo wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different</v>

1699
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.040
<v Speaker 2>tiny little buffaloes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Miniature Buffalo.</v>

1700
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.040
<v Speaker 2>There was a fucking episode of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jessica Simpson Show.</v>

1701
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Remember she's delivered that dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1702
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was trying to figure out how they</v>

1703
01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:49.010
<v Speaker 2>got wings from Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>

1704
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>She might've been playing dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

1705
01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be fucking cool though.</v>

1706
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1707
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 2>buffalo are dangerous as fuck too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1708
01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you account or buffalo,</v>

1709
01:10:57.741 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 2>especially during the Rut in a yellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>

1710
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.050
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They run you over,</v>

1711
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think you're going to kill them.</v>

1712
01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:06.290
<v Speaker 2>They're going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wild animals.</v>

1713
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Like people get fucked up by buffalo all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1714
01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a hilarious video I saw this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to get clothes.</v>

1715
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.210
<v Speaker 2>She's got to take a of these buffalo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the buffalo just sees him.</v>

1716
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1717
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1718
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And just charges at him to the man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I lived in Alaska,</v>

1719
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you'd see tourists all the time going up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bull Moose.</v>

1720
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Just think they're going to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of me.</v>

1721
01:11:24.641 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And literally they seen people walk up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to black bears just like,</v>

1722
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're in a zoo.</v>

1723
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:29.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People does not,</v>

1724
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't really understand the fact</v>

1725
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 2>that animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really kind of all animals</v>

1726
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>are potentially very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but particularly wild animals.</v>

1727
01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including people.</v>

1728
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:38.340
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1729
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 2>we're just so used to this civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where people can come up to</v>

1730
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 2>other people and say hi bears don't just</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up to bears and say hi.</v>

1731
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:47.640
<v Speaker 2>They have to know the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be reasonably sure the bear</v>

1732
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 2>is not going to bite them in the face</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get to know each other.</v>

1733
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a new bear comes into town,</v>

1734
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking war going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos.</v>

1735
01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Just like how it used to be with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the world that a fucking moves</v>

1736
01:11:58.831 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 2>is living in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't walk up on that Moose</v>

1737
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Dude that Louis is fighting off bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1738
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine being a Moose in Alaska and you</v>

1739
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:10.440
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with some potentially 10 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot tall,</v>

1740
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:15.030
<v Speaker 2>gigantic furry monster that just eats</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he can.</v>

1741
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does a bear weigh?</v>

1742
01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>A thousand fucking pounds a grizzly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of that thing is just running</v>

1743
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:23.490
<v Speaker 2>around looking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be on edge build little on edge.</v>

1744
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>So I'm fucking fat guy with a Las Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 2>visor on comes at you.</v>

1745

<v Speaker 2>It lives iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

1746
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.370

<v Speaker 2>I think you're cute.</v>

1747
01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:33.870
<v Speaker 2>You're going to take a selfie with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1748
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I live in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>

1749
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.240
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gigantic man.</v>

1751
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw my first moose couple of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska.</v>

1752
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1753
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't believe how big they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

1754
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1755
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.580
<v Speaker 2>it's Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in the interior about a</v>

1756
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 2>hundred miles from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fairbank's and he's like you some,</v>

1757
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.530
<v Speaker 2>you see a bull moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1758
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:54.330
<v Speaker 2>mature Bull Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can feel like you'd walk right under</v>

1759
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:54.991
<v Speaker 2>his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You probably could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:58.050
<v Speaker 2>People have driven under them in car</v>
<v Speaker 2>accidents.</v>

1762
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 2>They made it underneath the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just clip the roof on the underbelly of</v>

1763
01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1764
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Or an underbelly of the Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bison.</v>

1765
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Bison in person is a faces about as tall</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you are.</v>

1766
01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1767
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 2>They're monstrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monstrously huge and so fucking cool</v>

1768
01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 2>looking at when you see a bison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem like some star wars animal.</v>

1769
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 2>It really does seem like something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>star wars,</v>

1770
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.550
<v Speaker 2>like with his crazy lion kind of main</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing going on.</v>

1771
01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>You know they have the extra for in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front and like what?</v>

1772
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Like why did you grow so big?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did nature want you to be so fucking</v>

1773
01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>enormous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just step destroyer of grasses and</v>

1774
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:38.590
<v Speaker 2>either of grasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1775
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1776
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean if that wasn't real and you saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a movie,</v>

1777
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 2>that's a total star wars monster in</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

1778
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1779
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you would see like some dude with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like black motorcycle goggles on it with</v>

1780
01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:56.280
<v Speaker 2>a metal helmet riding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going over the top of the hill.</v>

1781
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.500
<v Speaker 2>And then what is the only thing he eats</v>
<v Speaker 2>his plants.</v>

1782
01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That's as crazy now it's like all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinny,</v>

1783
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.400
<v Speaker 2>skinny a plant jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1784
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.440
<v Speaker 2>then you've got the gorillas and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

1785
01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.630
<v Speaker 2>massive strong animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1786
01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moose,</v>

1787
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:10.080
<v Speaker 2>all of them eating grasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Gorillas are real weird because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just gigantic,</v>

1789
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>but they also have fangs and they're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>per pound per pound.</v>

1790
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:19.090
<v Speaker 2>The strongest animal in the whole world</v>
<v Speaker 2>eaten Broccoli and shit.</v>

1791
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1792
01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:25.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange when you see the d the</v>

1793
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>diversity of wildlife and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that all of this stuff,</v>

1794
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that evolution bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff came from single celled</v>

1795
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:35.710
<v Speaker 2>organisms and eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1796
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:41.310
<v Speaker 2>evolved and changed and mutated and</v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted and random mutation pressure</v>

1797
01:14:43.781 --> 01:14:46.240
<v Speaker 2>from the environment and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>became what they are now.</v>

1798
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:51.190
<v Speaker 2>This is what a bizarre world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's also a big part</v>

1799
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>of what's wrong with factory farming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with our disconnection from</v>

1800
01:14:56.111 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 2>our food is that we're very rarely</v>
<v Speaker 2>around animals.</v>

1801
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And to the point where I think most</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings think of it as like people</v>

1802
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:07.150
<v Speaker 2>and animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

1803
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 2>it's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the place.</v>

1804
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of different life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've just cleared off most of it to</v>

1805
01:15:12.881 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 2>like all you see is like birds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>squirrels and you don't even think of</v>

1806
01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 2>them cause they're around so often</v>
<v Speaker 2>though as another fucking bird shit on</v>

1807
01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:21.050
<v Speaker 2>my car asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drive off.</v>

1808
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:25.500
<v Speaker 2>But when you're around wild life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you've ever been in the woods</v>

1809
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:26.920
<v Speaker 2>and seeing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:31.921
<v Speaker 2>a population of Fox walk by and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the mama bear or in a couple of</v>

1811
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 2>cubs and you see these kinds of animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the wild and you realize like,</v>

1812
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 2>these fuckers are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

1813
01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>They've been here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're staying,</v>

1814
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 2>they breed here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is normal.</v>

1815
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.870
<v Speaker 2>They've been this way since Lewis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clark like hundreds of years ago.</v>

1816
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 2>They were just like this and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like this right now.</v>

1817
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 2>We just never go into that world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we forget that worlds even there.</v>

1818
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:54.230
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we have a huge disconnect.</v>

1819
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:55.011
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>

1820
01:15:55.011 --> 01:15:57.050
<v Speaker 5>from our food and from the natural</v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1821
01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:01.340
<v Speaker 5>It's like we live in concrete boxes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we drive in cars and it's like we forget</v>

1822
01:16:01.341 --> 01:16:03.560
<v Speaker 5>that we are part of this whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1823
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a big part of what cowspiracy</v>

1824
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:07.910
<v Speaker 5>does too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that remind people that you're part</v>

1825
01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 5>of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1826
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:10.970
<v Speaker 5>whether you want to or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're part of the system.</v>

1827
01:16:10.971 --> 01:16:12.740
<v Speaker 5>You're dependent upon the atmosphere for</v>
<v Speaker 5>your air.</v>

1828
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.780
<v Speaker 5>You're dependent upon the ground for</v>
<v Speaker 5>your water.</v>

1829
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're presenting on the soil</v>
<v Speaker 5>for your food.</v>

1830
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.760
<v Speaker 5>It's like this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way getting out of it.</v>

1831
01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the first time I think our</v>

1832
01:16:22.851 --> 01:16:24.680
<v Speaker 5>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'm older than you guys,</v>

1833
01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:25.670
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1834
01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:30.050
<v Speaker 5>the generations of the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are alive today,</v>

1835
01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 5>let's just call it the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>awake and alive and paying attention</v>

1836
01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:33.350
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

1837
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:38.300
<v Speaker 5>This is really probably unprecedented</v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of understanding of the</v>

1838
01:16:38.301 --> 01:16:40.320
<v Speaker 5>consequences of the way we're living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1839
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.920
<v Speaker 5>I really don't think it's ever been like</v>
<v Speaker 5>this before.</v>

1840
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:48.100
<v Speaker 5>We're so many people are so aware of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has been set up and this system</v>

1841
01:16:48.111 --> 01:16:51.050
<v Speaker 5>that we're born into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the system that we just,</v>

1842
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.890
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1843
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:54.610
<v Speaker 5>we went to school and we got to high</v>
<v Speaker 5>school and we got jobs and we became</v>

1844
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:55.401
<v Speaker 5>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we,</v>

1845
01:16:55.401 --> 01:16:58.040
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then as adults we start looking</v>

1846
01:16:58.041 --> 01:17:01.580
<v Speaker 5>around and going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who fucking design the Democrats and the</v>

1847
01:17:01.581 --> 01:17:02.630
<v Speaker 5>Republicans?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1848
01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 5>It's the only these fucking two people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only people and their idea,</v>

1849
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 5>why is this fucking wear this meat</v>
<v Speaker 5>sandwich come from?</v>

1850
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 4>How can I just go through this spot and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could reach my hand out my metal box</v>

1851
01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 4>with rubber tires and can this guy paper</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he gives me a ground meat sandwich.</v>

1852
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I just drive off</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this cool.</v>

1853
01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:22.460
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1854
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:26.540
<v Speaker 4>the film ends as a real inspiring ways</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people are turning on now.</v>

1855
01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's something just in the past</v>

1856
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:29.780
<v Speaker 4>couple of years you can just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel it.</v>

1857
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Like this transformation of just</v>
<v Speaker 4>information passes so fast.</v>

1858
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:35.000
<v Speaker 4>You can't hide things from people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1859
01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 4>do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you worry at all that something like</v>

1860
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 4>that Patriot Act thing could be somehow</v>
<v Speaker 4>or another applied to people make</v>

1861
01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 4>documentaries that expose?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always like that.</v>

1862
01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:47.390
<v Speaker 4>When we made the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kind of how it went down.</v>

1863
01:17:47.391 --> 01:17:48.224
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

1864
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 4>we really took a step back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd,</v>

1865
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:52.660
<v Speaker 4>after we talked to Howard Lyman that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1866
01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.930
<v Speaker 4>the rancher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's scared,</v>

1867
01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:54.950
<v Speaker 4>he's scared the shit out of us.</v>

1868
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.620
<v Speaker 4>He really did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were talking once we released the</v>

1869
01:17:57.621 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 4>film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we go to Cuba for a couple of</v>

1870
01:17:59.540 --> 01:17:59.901
<v Speaker 4>months?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>

1871
01:17:59.901 --> 01:18:02.180
<v Speaker 4>so we was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he scared us and he says,</v>

1872
01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:02.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch out.</v>

1873
01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:04.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is serious shit.</v>

1874
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.240
<v Speaker 4>And then so we realized finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1875
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:09.560
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to do if we just</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand,</v>

1876
01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:11.300
<v Speaker 4>stand back and do nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stay silent,</v>

1877
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 4>we're all screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1878
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:15.500
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fear of not doing something has to</v>

1879
01:18:15.501 --> 01:18:18.260
<v Speaker 4>supersede the fear of one individual</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing something.</v>

1880
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:20.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to step up and all do something</v>

1881
01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:23.210
<v Speaker 4>because if not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to live in a world</v>

1882
01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:24.590
<v Speaker 4>full of cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1883
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's in a monoculture of cows and</v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction and we're not going to be</v>

1884
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 4>run anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was scary.</v>

1885
01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:31.010
<v Speaker 4>But now at the point it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1886
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 4>a year and a half since we released it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're already on door,</v>

1887
01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:34.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1888
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.370
<v Speaker 4>or new new project coming along right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now too.</v>

1889
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:39.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you haven't had any blow back at all</v>

1890
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:42.620
<v Speaker 3>when we released the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we originally,</v>

1891
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:46.760
<v Speaker 3>we did a crowd funding campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we released the film and a week after we</v>

1892
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 3>premiered it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beef magazine did a write up about the</v>

1893
01:18:49.101 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 3>film called [inaudible] magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which apparently,</v>

1894
01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:55.400
<v Speaker 3>so he porn magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think it's the other one.</v>

1895
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Or is it a rap battle magazine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1896
01:18:59.091 --> 01:19:01.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they do this write up called a why</v>

1897
01:19:01.141 --> 01:19:02.750
<v Speaker 3>ranchers should be concerned about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary.</v>

1898
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Cowspiracy and I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1899
01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:06.110
<v Speaker 3>this film's coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got these stats and you should know</v>

1900
01:19:06.111 --> 01:19:08.090
<v Speaker 3>your numbers because this is coming down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pipeline.</v>

1901
01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.820
<v Speaker 3>And we've had a couple other industries</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that sort of stuff.</v>

1902
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:12.230
<v Speaker 3>And we get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1903
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 3>we get some threatening sort of messages</v>
<v Speaker 3>and facebook posts and stuff like that,</v>

1904
01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.480
<v Speaker 3>but boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1905
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:17.991
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1906
01:19:17.991 --> 01:19:20.570
<v Speaker 3>just the same bullshit that anyone that</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets on the Internet.</v>

1907
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess a lot of people don't get</v>

1908
01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:26.290
<v Speaker 3>threats from the cattle industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of,</v>

1909
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of threats are you giving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1910
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:28.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1911
01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you guys should fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1912
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:33.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope somebody fucking shoot you guys,</v>

1913
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of,</v>

1914
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope somebody shoots you guys boys.</v>

1915
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.400
<v Speaker 4>So why did they say,</v>

1916
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were the film,</v>

1917
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and exposes the atrocities of this</v>

1918
01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 3>industry and that's a threat to a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's livelihood.</v>

1919
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:52.450
<v Speaker 3>And so of course there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed back</v>

1920
01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:55.790
<v Speaker 4>saying that you should die because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>showed facts.</v>

1921
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing we'd say,</v>

1922
01:19:56.991 --> 01:20:00.130
<v Speaker 4>nothing ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do is interview people interview.</v>

1923
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:00.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1924
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:03.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you narrate a few of the facts and then</v>

1925
01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.000
<v Speaker 4>the numbers and statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1926
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 3>we're not telling anybody what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1927
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>How could someone say</v>

1928
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 2>that you should die because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1929
01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most emotional screenings we</v>

1930
01:20:11.301 --> 01:20:13.480
<v Speaker 2>went to Idaho because my dad's from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idaho and um,</v>

1931
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:14.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a rancher.</v>

1932
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.230
<v Speaker 2>My grandfathers or interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them.</v>

1933
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And so I very sympathetic to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going through and what we,</v>

1934
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>what were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1935
01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 2>there are next level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of switch that has to happen or we're</v>

1936
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 2>screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1937
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:27.450
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to learn a new trade all</v>

1938
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how to grow organic vegetables when</v>

1939
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 2>there's within been doing it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1940
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant issue also that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are in debt.</v>

1941
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are barely getting by as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1942
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:41.930
<v Speaker 2>The world of being a farmer is</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly labor intensive and very</v>

1943
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:45.420
<v Speaker 2>expensive and hard to turn a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>

1944
01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we all know of farms that have gone</v>

1945
01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 2>under him and that's why they started</v>
<v Speaker 2>those farm aid concerts and you know,</v>

1946
01:20:50.551 --> 01:20:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Willie Nelson was it John Mellencamp was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of those kinds of,</v>

1947
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was what that was all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to help the American farmer.</v>

1948
01:20:57.730 --> 01:20:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:20:59.260 --> 01:20:59.980
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1950
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.500
<v Speaker 3>it's about providing information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let people make up their own minds.</v>

1951
01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so we had concern,</v>

1952
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:07.390
<v Speaker 3>major concern about the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just kind of let it go.</v>

1953
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just feel like,</v>

1954
01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're protected by all the people who</v>

1955
01:21:10.451 --> 01:21:12.880
<v Speaker 3>back us up who supported the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1956
01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:17.970
<v Speaker 3>and then Leonardo Dicaprio saw the film</v>
<v Speaker 3>and got super excited about it.</v>

1957
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.960
<v Speaker 3>They caught in touch with us and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his producers,</v>

1958
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1959
01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leo saw your film,</v>

1960
01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.610
<v Speaker 3>loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to be executive producer,</v>

1961
01:21:27.611 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 3>wants to take it to Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually took it to Netflix already and</v>

1962
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:31.780
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're interested in taking the film</v>

1963
01:21:31.781 --> 01:21:32.650
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1964
01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Right away he brought it to Netflix</v>
<v Speaker 3>without asking,</v>

1965
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:36.250
<v Speaker 3>not even talking to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is awesome.</v>

1966
01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.340
<v Speaker 3>So gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so they,</v>

1968
01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they had major concern like,</v>

1969
01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:42.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leonardo Dicaprio,</v>

1970
01:21:42.401 --> 01:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>like a list celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest name.</v>

1971
01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Like he's putting his name on a super</v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial film.</v>

1972
01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.880
<v Speaker 3>And so we went through the film again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we just scoured it for all of our</v>

1973
01:21:51.881 --> 01:21:54.490
<v Speaker 3>facts and back everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like on our website,</v>

1974
01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:58.240
<v Speaker 3>all the stats that we were throwing out</v>
<v Speaker 3>through this podcast and in the film or</v>

1975
01:21:58.241 --> 01:22:00.340
<v Speaker 3>on our website,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cowspiracy.com there's a fact page.</v>

1976
01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:02.530
<v Speaker 3>It has linked to every single study and</v>
<v Speaker 3>reference.</v>

1977
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so that was in major concern.</v>

1978
01:22:05.201 --> 01:22:05.561
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1979
01:22:05.561 --> 01:22:08.230
<v Speaker 3>once a huge name and this hits totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>

1980
01:22:08.231 --> 01:22:10.780
<v Speaker 3>went on Netflix back in September and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just blown up.</v>

1981
01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to get even more pushback?</v>

1982
01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.400
<v Speaker 3>And so far we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1983
01:22:15.401 --> 01:22:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I think the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the injury is smart,</v>

1984
01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:20.110
<v Speaker 3>which is questionable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll continue to ignore us as best</v>

1985
01:22:20.111 --> 01:22:22.690
<v Speaker 3>they can because it's only going to draw</v>
<v Speaker 3>more attention if they come after us.</v>

1986
01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that they can adapt?</v>

1987
01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the hall they do.</v>

1988
01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the awesome thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1989
01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:34.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>silk soy milk was owned by one of the</v>

1990
01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 3>largest dairy companies in the u s</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they looked at it and they said,</v>

1991
01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:37.751
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1992
01:22:37.751 --> 01:22:41.410
<v Speaker 3>we're losing part of our market to plant</v>
<v Speaker 3>based milks.</v>

1993
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.570
<v Speaker 3>We should by plant based milks because</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1994
01:22:43.571 --> 01:22:45.350
<v Speaker 3>they're not really interested in hurting</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

1995
01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:46.780
<v Speaker 3>They're not interested in hurting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

1996
01:22:46.781 --> 01:22:48.010
<v Speaker 3>So I don't make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to make money.</v>

1997
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.920
<v Speaker 3>So it's like when people switch over to</v>
<v Speaker 3>more sustainable foods,</v>

1998
01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.110
<v Speaker 3>that's where they see the money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to follow the money.</v>

1999
01:22:53.111 --> 01:22:55.210
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the real hopefuls for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2000
01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.580
<v Speaker 2>There was another dark part of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>is watching,</v>

2001
01:22:57.581 --> 01:23:00.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dairy cows watching how they're</v>

2002
01:23:00.161 --> 01:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>extracting the milk from and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2003
01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.690
<v Speaker 2>uhhh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

2004
01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.540
<v Speaker 2>that was the best farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2005
01:23:04.541 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best,</v>

2006
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 4>kind of like when you said you visited</v>
<v Speaker 4>your buddy's farm,</v>

2007
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 4>we thought it was going to be nice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2008
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be kind of a weird part</v>

2009
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 4>of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause you can see these beautiful cows</v>

2010
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:17.530
<v Speaker 4>and that's just one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know their kids are up on the hill</v>

2011
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 4>face the other way and they hang out by</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2012
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Kind of stare at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just this,</v>

2013
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:22.203
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2014
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:27.330
<v Speaker 4>thousand cows that the visceral feeling</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can feel in the air of just sadness.</v>

2015
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the toughest day we went to a</v>

2016
01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouse on fear factor once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2017
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stunt they had to do in a</v>

2018
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2019
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:41.260
<v Speaker 4>I remember the feeling that you got when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were in the building.</v>

2020
01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.660
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2021
01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give this is there's like a feeling in</v>

2022
01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:47.500
<v Speaker 4>the air here.</v>

2023
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be all hippie dippie woo</v>

2024
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:54.340
<v Speaker 4>crystals and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I really felt like you could feel</v>

2025
01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:55.750
<v Speaker 4>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2026
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:59.020
<v Speaker 4>you could eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like a vibration that you</v>

2027
01:23:59.021 --> 01:24:01.750
<v Speaker 4>could detect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is very strange.</v>

2028
01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.140
<v Speaker 4>It's a very strange feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>

2029
01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:05.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those animals feel that and then it goes</v>

2030
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 4>into adrenaline and all of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones are pumping through their</v>

2031
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:11.290
<v Speaker 4>system the moment that they're killed</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you're eating that.</v>

2032
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:14.650
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was maybe that's a good point for,</v>

2033
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.230
<v Speaker 4>so talking about fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2034
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 4>addressing the animal agriculture</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

2035
01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 4>We were going to make an announcement on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your show.</v>

2036
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:25.270
<v Speaker 4>Super stuck that we are making our new</v>
<v Speaker 4>film and it's called what the health,</v>

2037
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:28.120
<v Speaker 4>that the exact same thing is happening</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the health industry,</v>

2038
01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 4>the leading cause of diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart disease,</v>

2039
01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:34.030
<v Speaker 4>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer is from eating animal products.</v>

2040
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:36.550
<v Speaker 4>And the same thing's happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>American Cancer Society,</v>

2041
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.090
<v Speaker 4>the American diabetic society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these organizations are not telling</v>

2042
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.850
<v Speaker 4>the information that's coming out of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these facts.</v>

2043
01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:43.781
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2044
01:24:43.781 --> 01:24:47.260
<v Speaker 4>countless medical studies of what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really killing us and causing diseases.</v>

2045
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:49.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's coming out here soon too.</v>

2046
01:24:49.661 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are the facts as far as like</v>

2047
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:54.580
<v Speaker 4>what's causing cancer and how has that</v>
<v Speaker 4>been proven?</v>

2048
01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 4>So there's been a couple of studies that</v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

2049
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's the obvious ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the World Health Organization just</v>

2050
01:24:59.051 --> 01:25:02.440
<v Speaker 4>announced that the processed meat is</v>
<v Speaker 4>linked to colon rectal cancer.</v>

2051
01:25:02.441 --> 01:25:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So process me being meet with chemical</v>

2052
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:06.670
<v Speaker 4>preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they included Bacon,</v>

2053
01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:07.820
<v Speaker 4>Ham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2054
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all process meet with chemical</v>

2055
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:12.420
<v Speaker 4>presented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put it in the same category as a,</v>

2056
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:17.200
<v Speaker 4>our cynic can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's carcinogenics yes.</v>

2057
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Exact same category as tobacco smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was after thousands of studies.</v>

2058
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:25.600
<v Speaker 4>And that blew people away because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot believe they actually announced</v>

2059
01:25:25.601 --> 01:25:26.860
<v Speaker 4>that I was one of the biggest things.</v>

2060
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.960
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then now all these other</v>

2061
01:25:28.961 --> 01:25:30.700
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're slowly,</v>

2062
01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:32.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of putting in the back of their,</v>

2063
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:33.730
<v Speaker 4>their website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe mentioning it,</v>

2064
01:25:33.731 --> 01:25:35.740
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're doing the same thing in this</v>

2065
01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 4>film is that word or interviewing these</v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations and uncovering,</v>

2066
01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:41.710
<v Speaker 4>and it's so crazy out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the exact same thing as</v>

2067
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:43.640
<v Speaker 4>cowspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2068
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:48.790
<v Speaker 4>but there have also been studies linking</v>
<v Speaker 4>grassfed beef to healthy fats and that</v>

2069
01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 4>it's actually healthy for you to eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed animals.</v>

2070
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:54.490
<v Speaker 4>So I think what you're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 4>just preservatives.</v>

2071
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:57.930
<v Speaker 4>She's talking about chemically processed</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals unfortunately now.</v>

2072
01:25:57.931 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 4>And because like the World Health</v>
<v Speaker 4>Organization's showed that red meat</v>

2073
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:02.830
<v Speaker 4>unprocessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just broad red meat is off,</v>

2074
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 4>there's type two carcinogen.</v>

2075
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.140
<v Speaker 5>And how are they making that</v>
<v Speaker 5>distinction?</v>

2076
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they following?</v>

2077
01:26:07.911 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 5>People that ate a healthy diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy vegetables as long with red</v>

2078
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:14.120
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll do these huge,</v>

2079
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.950
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the epic health study,</v>

2080
01:26:15.951 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 5>which has fallen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2081
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.780
<v Speaker 5>250,000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2082
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 5>for over the last 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's these massive population</v>

2083
01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:23.600
<v Speaker 5>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2084
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:25.410
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2085
01:26:25.411 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 5>the studies and that's something we go</v>
<v Speaker 5>into in the film because there was</v>

2086
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.360
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can look at it and be like,</v>

2087
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.400
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>red meat causes heart disease.</v>

2088
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 5>And then you'll have another study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says,</v>

2089
01:26:32.451 --> 01:26:32.960
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2090
01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these meats are actually good for you.</v>

2091
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.030
<v Speaker 5>And then you just look at the funding so</v>
<v Speaker 5>well who funded the studies and the</v>

2092
01:26:38.031 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 5>fund,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the studies who are saying that meat's</v>

2093
01:26:39.621 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 5>bad for you are funded by universities</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the studies are saying this stuff is</v>

2094
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:44.900
<v Speaker 5>good for you.</v>

2095
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 5>It's funded by the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like literally paid for by the</v>

2096
01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 5>American beef council.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2097
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean this film is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to probably crazier in a</v>

2098
01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:54.440
<v Speaker 5>way than cal spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause we also add in the link that we</v>

2099
01:26:54.441 --> 01:26:56.130
<v Speaker 5>didn't have to deal with in the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue.</v>

2100
01:26:56.131 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about like fear and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2101
01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 5>The pharmaceutical company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they're tied into this trinity.</v>

2102
01:27:00.621 --> 01:27:02.900
<v Speaker 5>You know you have the anti culture</v>
<v Speaker 5>industry of the lobby group,</v>

2103
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 5>you have the government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the health organizations.</v>

2104
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.220
<v Speaker 5>Then you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pharmaceutical companies that profit</v>

2105
01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 5>off people getting sick from eating</v>
<v Speaker 5>their products.</v>

2106
01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 5>So you have this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're saying the pharmaceutical</v>

2107
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:19.400
<v Speaker 5>companies that profit off of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting sick from eating meat support</v>

2108
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:23.360
<v Speaker 5>meet because they willingly are aware.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Willingfully are aware that people are</v>

2109
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 5>getting sick from them and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure that they have unhealthy</v>

2110
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:28.094
<v Speaker 5>people to treat.</v>

2111
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:28.990
<v Speaker 5>We look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got,</v>

2112
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 5>you have a $2 trillion stint industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have,</v>

2113
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 5>you don't have literally trillion dollar</v>
<v Speaker 5>industries who make,</v>

2114
01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs and who make,</v>

2115
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:38.983
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>surgeries.</v>

2116
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 5>They don't want that to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want that to continue.</v>

2117
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.420
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you really think they're actively</v>

2118
01:27:44.421 --> 01:27:47.550
<v Speaker 5>trying to keep people unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2119
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2120
01:27:48.441 --> 01:27:51.020
<v Speaker 5>it's just about inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about suppressing information.</v>

2121
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.310
<v Speaker 5>It's about suppressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

2122
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:54.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to keep upl keeping people healthy.</v>

2123
01:27:54.681 --> 01:27:55.820
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2124
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:57.290
<v Speaker 5>you look to these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look to these whole,</v>

2125
01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.270
<v Speaker 5>to health organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you look to,</v>

2126
01:27:59.271 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 5>to tell us the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at the environmental groups,</v>

2127
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 5>they're suppressing this information of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thousands of thousands of studies</v>

2128
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:07.940
<v Speaker 5>upon studies that have this information</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over.</v>

2129
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 5>Yet it's not being told to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2130
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.700
<v Speaker 5>But the pharmaceutical companies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do they even have to suppress</v>

2131
01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:16.490
<v Speaker 5>information?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people willfully ignore</v>

2132
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

2133
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:21.140
<v Speaker 5>So why would they go out of their way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>suppress information when it doesn't</v>

2134
01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:24.500
<v Speaker 5>seem like there's any sort of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 5>or trend so that people to get</v>

2135
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 5>healthier?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2136
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.280
<v Speaker 5>But it's pretty interesting when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow,</v>

2137
01:28:28.281 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 5>you look at these health organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at their donors,</v>

2138
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 5>they're their biggest donors are</v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2139
01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:36.200
<v Speaker 5>And the next second biggest donors are</v>
<v Speaker 5>meat and dairy producers.</v>

2140
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 5>So do you think that that's to ensure</v>
<v Speaker 5>that people stay ignorant?</v>

2141
01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:46.240
<v Speaker 5>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the simple fact if you have diabetes</v>

2142
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:50.750
<v Speaker 5>type two diabetes leading cause of type</v>
<v Speaker 5>two diabetes is from eating animal</v>

2143
01:28:50.751 --> 01:28:51.820
<v Speaker 5>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2144
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.700
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it was,</v>

2145
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.670
<v Speaker 5>here's the problem with saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're eating other things as well.</v>

2146
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.820
<v Speaker 5>And how are you monitoring these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people's diets?</v>

2147
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Are you making sure that you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 5>what these people put in their body?</v>

2148
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 5>They're not putting in processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are not putting in chemicals,</v>

2149
01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:07.050
<v Speaker 5>they're only eating meat and vegetables.</v>

2150
01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they only eating me like what the</v>

2151
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:11.240
<v Speaker 5>fuck are they eating?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you know this awesome thing?</v>

2152
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 5>There's a study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a NIH study that looked at follow</v>

2153
01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:17.580
<v Speaker 5>people's diets for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think four years.</v>

2154
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:20.040
<v Speaker 5>Huge Group of people and looked at just</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2155
01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:20.431
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2156
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:21.540
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the role?</v>

2157
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 5>What is the link?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I or mental,</v>

2158
01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2159
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.020
<v Speaker 5>Been cities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2160
01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:26.550
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the stress levels,</v>

2161
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 5>all the huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huge,</v>

2162
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the different aspects.</v>

2163
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 5>Then they took just animal products out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They left them have their total shitty,</v>

2164
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>die at sea and just totally processed</v>

2165
01:29:36.231 --> 01:29:39.360
<v Speaker 5>crappy sugar food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They monitor these people or they let</v>

2166
01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:41.860
<v Speaker 5>these people report their diets and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a couple,</v>

2167
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 5>there's at least five studies that have</v>
<v Speaker 5>done similar sort of things and I think</v>

2168
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.850
<v Speaker 5>some of them had been straight like</v>
<v Speaker 5>monitored and how many people were</v>

2169
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 5>talking about in these studies?</v>

2170
01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Thousands and thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of people that they need aid</v>

2171
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.080
<v Speaker 5>report their diet and then told them</v>
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't eat meat but they could</v>

2172
01:29:55.081 --> 01:29:55.990
<v Speaker 5>eat shitty foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.040
<v Speaker 5>They sat and they listened while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's far as we know.</v>

2174
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2175
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think I,</v>

2176
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 5>high level skepticism is totally needed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It got to a point when it's study after</v>

2177
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:06.850
<v Speaker 5>study after study and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 5>corollary,</v>

2178
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:11.870
<v Speaker 5>see I haven't seen study after study</v>
<v Speaker 5>after study is these things are talking</v>

2179
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:14.620
<v Speaker 5>about digging deep and investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2180
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.280
<v Speaker 5>people have been eating meat forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2181
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this link between carbohydrates and</v>

2182
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.330
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can eat,</v>

2183
01:30:21.331 --> 01:30:23.310
<v Speaker 5>you can eat a high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2184
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:26.040
<v Speaker 5>And low carbohydrates and you won't</v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily develop diabetes.</v>

2185
01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Devoted genic ketogenic diet is also</v>
<v Speaker 5>prevents diabetes,</v>

2186
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:32.610
<v Speaker 5>not diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Epilepsy,</v>

2187
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:34.800
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge issue in children when</v>

2188
01:30:34.801 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 5>they started giving them high fat diets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're finding that low carbohydrate,</v>

2189
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:43.260
<v Speaker 5>high fat diets that introduce a state of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ketosis is actually very good at</v>

2190
01:30:43.261 --> 01:30:46.500
<v Speaker 5>preventing symptoms of epilepsy in</v>
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>

2191
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.870
<v Speaker 5>My partner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she works with a younger with epilepsy</v>

2192
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:50.130
<v Speaker 5>and she's on the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

2193
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:52.890
<v Speaker 5>But she's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's brought Vegan too even and still</v>

2194
01:30:52.891 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 5>ketogenic so you can still not avocado</v>
<v Speaker 5>oil,</v>

2195
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:57.400
<v Speaker 5>peanut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2196
01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.540
<v Speaker 5>but you know at that doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 5>protect you from heart disease,</v>

2197
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:02.020
<v Speaker 5>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2198
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.440
<v Speaker 5>So when you eat a high carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high fat diet,</v>

2199
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 5>so that's when you develop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what about sedentary lifestyle?</v>

2200
01:31:08.341 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 5>What about all the different factors</v>
<v Speaker 5>that come into play?</v>

2201
01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.620
<v Speaker 5>We're keeping about a person's body</v>
<v Speaker 5>health.</v>

2202
01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:16.080
<v Speaker 5>They're like our preferred that one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the primary factors in cardiovascular</v>

2203
01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:20.670
<v Speaker 5>disease is sedentary lifestyle is the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that your body atrophies as much as</v>

2204
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:23.130
<v Speaker 5>your muscles atrophy and your back</v>
<v Speaker 5>deteriorates,</v>

2205
01:31:23.131 --> 01:31:26.100
<v Speaker 5>your heart does as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that a lot of that can be mitigated</v>

2206
01:31:26.101 --> 01:31:27.990
<v Speaker 5>with exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one of the correlations that</v>

2207
01:31:27.991 --> 01:31:32.820
<v Speaker 5>people are ignoring when they study diet</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Diet and in relationship to</v>

2208
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:35.220
<v Speaker 5>people's health is what are they doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with their body?</v>

2209
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:39.300
<v Speaker 5>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the physical daily activity level of</v>

2210
01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:41.520
<v Speaker 5>their body and how much is that factored</v>
<v Speaker 5>in?</v>

2211
01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:43.590
<v Speaker 5>Because you can't just factor in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person's diet.</v>

2212
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:48.540
<v Speaker 5>That's like your body is a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body is this biological diverse</v>

2213
01:31:48.541 --> 01:31:51.510
<v Speaker 5>machine that is a whole ecosystem inside</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

2214
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't stress it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you don't force it to work,</v>

2215
01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 5>it gets weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just does.</v>

2216
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:59.340
<v Speaker 5>It just does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't demand resources,</v>

2217
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:00.323
<v Speaker 5>it will</v>

2218
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.430
<v Speaker 2>slowly deteriorate slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we explore that too.</v>

2219
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>You know how much a exercise has a role</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's huge.</v>

2220
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you still have to clean your engine</v>

2221
01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:11.110
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to clean your pipes out,</v>

2222
01:32:11.111 --> 01:32:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it's doing.</v>

2223
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pumping the engine.</v>

2224
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.050
<v Speaker 2>But when you have a clogged arteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there comes a point where it can be</v>

2225
01:32:17.051 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2226
01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:18.461
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2227
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:20.320
<v Speaker 2>you just do a clean diet for even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:23.650
<v Speaker 2>try 30 days or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that flushing out of you and when</v>

2229
01:32:23.651 --> 01:32:26.140
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting on the toilet for four or</v>
<v Speaker 2>five times a day,</v>

2230
01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our of 10 times a day,</v>

2231
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.290
<v Speaker 2>it's just flushing all this shit inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you and even your extra hours</v>

2232
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:32.950
<v Speaker 2>exercising every time a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

2233
01:32:32.951 --> 01:32:36.340
<v Speaker 2>that's trying to process this food that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting into it,</v>

2234
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 2>that it can't do just their exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not food.</v>

2235
01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like laying inside your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a myth.</v>

2236
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 2>There's not like caked food inside of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's by like that whole idea that</v>

2237
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 2>every moon of six pounds of undigested</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet and you're dead if that's the case.</v>

2238
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:52.660
<v Speaker 2>But you do have plaque building up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your arm.</v>

2239
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.910
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely plaque.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2240
01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.480
<v Speaker 2>that speaks to a person's level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical activity.</v>

2241
01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.730
<v Speaker 2>There's different nutritional demands</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone that has a rigorous physical</v>

2242
01:33:00.731 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 2>activity schedule and someone who does</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and when you give your body the same</v>

2243
01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:08.990
<v Speaker 2>amount of food is someone who like say a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking sprint or something like that</v>

2244
01:33:08.991 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>were a marathon runner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's,</v>

2245
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly burning off fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you give your body,</v>

2246
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:15.910
<v Speaker 2>if you have a sedentary lifestyle in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of a computer sitting in a cubicle</v>

2247
01:33:15.911 --> 01:33:19.540
<v Speaker 2>all day and you give your body the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of food that the person who's a</v>

2248
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:22.150
<v Speaker 2>jogger consumes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get fat and fucked up</v>

2249
01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.020
<v Speaker 2>because you're taking in too many</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories and that's a contributor,</v>

2250
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:28.950
<v Speaker 2>a massive contributor to heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to be considered always.</v>

2251
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking about what's going</v>

2252
01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>on with the person's body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got bio diversity,</v>

2253
01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:35.200
<v Speaker 2>like where are these people from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2254
01:33:35.201 --> 01:33:37.510
<v Speaker 2>What part of the world are their</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors from?</v>

2255
01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Because your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your genetics have different biological</v>

2256
01:33:40.211 --> 01:33:41.590
<v Speaker 2>requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go into genetics,</v>

2257
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>we have a whole chapter on genetics</v>
<v Speaker 2>edge.</v>

2258
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:46.160
<v Speaker 2>What does genetics was only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2259
01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 3>well as far as diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as diet too,</v>

2260
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:51.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another side subject that we get</v>

2261
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:53.520
<v Speaker 3>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's one of the aspects that I've</v>

2262
01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:55.600
<v Speaker 3>looked going to back to the lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exercise.</v>

2263
01:33:55.601 --> 01:34:00.601
<v Speaker 3>There's huge study that just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 40,000 people in Sweden and they</v>

2264
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:05.731
<v Speaker 3>showed that having a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being active versus Allah,</v>

2265
01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:10.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it looked at the difference between</v>

2266
01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:14.770
<v Speaker 3>someone who exercises all the time who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight and someone who is skinny,</v>

2267
01:34:14.771 --> 01:34:19.690
<v Speaker 3>who sedentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are less likely to die from being</v>

2268
01:34:19.691 --> 01:34:24.040
<v Speaker 3>sedentary and skinny than being</v>
<v Speaker 3>overweight and active.</v>

2269
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2270
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.791
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll also,</v>

2271
01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:28.850
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with someone whose body</v>
<v Speaker 2>has gotten to a point where it's</v>

2272
01:34:28.851 --> 01:34:33.050
<v Speaker 2>deteriorated so poorly that the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress of exercise can be detrimental.</v>

2273
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some people that they</v>

2274
01:34:34.941 --> 01:34:35.870
<v Speaker 2>actually say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2275
01:34:35.871 --> 01:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>before you engage in any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

2276
01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:41.090
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to lose weight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to change your diet</v>

2277
01:34:41.091 --> 01:34:43.970
<v Speaker 2>and give your body a lot of nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

2278
01:34:43.971 --> 01:34:46.640
<v Speaker 2>you have a really nutrient deficient</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

2279
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going of course osteoporosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different diseases that</v>

2280
01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:54.740
<v Speaker 2>people get from having nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 2>deficient diets.</v>

2281
01:34:54.741 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It's a big contributed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why when women have to give them</v>

2282
01:34:57.891 --> 01:34:58.670
<v Speaker 2>calcium.</v>

2283
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:00.980
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that mitigates it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this is,</v>

2285
01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:05.600
<v Speaker 5>this new film goes into huge depth about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2286
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.240
<v Speaker 5>Similar to cowspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just packed full of information.</v>

2287
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 5>My point about this disease thing like</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that it causes cancer and all</v>

2288
01:35:12.381 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just trying to be skeptical</v>

2289
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 5>just for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said what?</v>

2290
01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:22.540
<v Speaker 5>What is stopping these people from</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating nutrient rich vegetables and you</v>

2291
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:28.541
<v Speaker 5>know and and really</v>
<v Speaker 5>broad variety of nutrient rich foods as</v>

2292
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:32.810
<v Speaker 5>well as meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2293
01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.760
<v Speaker 5>if you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would that be bad for you?</v>

2294
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.050
<v Speaker 5>If you had a rigorous exercise schedule</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you took care of your body,</v>

2295
01:35:39.051 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 5>you drank a lot of water and you ate</v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrient dense foods as well as me,</v>

2296
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 5>what kind of cancer you getting there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that's really how people are</v>

2297
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:50.120
<v Speaker 5>supposed to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not necessarily that the only</v>

2298
01:35:50.121 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 5>problem is that they're eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that may be a problem.</v>

2299
01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 5>But it may not be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It may be a problem just because your</v>

2300
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 5>body's just shit cause you're not doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything with it.</v>

2301
01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2302
01:35:59.181 --> 01:36:00.590
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely not something the film</v>
<v Speaker 5>explores.</v>

2303
01:36:00.591 --> 01:36:04.730
<v Speaker 5>It says the associations to these strong</v>
<v Speaker 5>associations between certain types of</v>

2304
01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:07.070
<v Speaker 5>foods and lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what the whole film is about.</v>

2305
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.290
<v Speaker 5>It's what the health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it's asking that question.</v>

2306
01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:11.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like what the hell is going on with</v>
<v Speaker 5>our health in the United States.</v>

2307
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 5>There's another study that came out</v>
<v Speaker 5>recently that talked about living in</v>

2308
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:16.550
<v Speaker 5>urban environments takes 10 years off</v>
<v Speaker 5>your life,</v>

2309
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.910
<v Speaker 5>like where you were breathing in brake</v>
<v Speaker 5>dust all the time and not even thinking</v>

2310
01:36:19.911 --> 01:36:22.250
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's worried about carbon dioxide</v>

2311
01:36:22.251 --> 01:36:23.830
<v Speaker 5>and the poison that comes out of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2312
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.250
<v Speaker 5>exhaust engines from engines but brake</v>
<v Speaker 5>dust fucking terrible for you.</v>

2313
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 5>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a leading polluter of waterways and</v>

2314
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.190
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that washes off into the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean.</v>

2315
01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's something to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>considered about that as well.</v>

2316
01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.570
<v Speaker 5>It's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

2317
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 5>There's so many stats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is we've been editing nonstop.</v>

2318
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:42.111
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2319
01:36:42.111 --> 01:36:46.490
<v Speaker 5>running on three hours of sleep that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to share about how just eating once</v>

2320
01:36:46.491 --> 01:36:49.100
<v Speaker 5>a week when you add the f cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was it diabetes?</v>

2321
01:36:49.101 --> 01:36:52.580
<v Speaker 5>How just like once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how it raised a certain percentage of</v>

2322
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:55.040
<v Speaker 5>coming back again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just one time a week.</v>

2323
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:56.960
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean by eating once a week?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2324
01:36:56.961 --> 01:36:59.870
<v Speaker 5>like eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a woman who has had breast</v>

2325
01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:04.820
<v Speaker 5>cancer by eating one serving of whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>dairy a day increases her chance of</v>

2326
01:37:04.821 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 5>dying from breast cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2327
01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:08.540
<v Speaker 5>You weren't being clear on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately what you're saying,</v>

2328
01:37:08.541 --> 01:37:12.830
<v Speaker 5>but once a week or eating two servings</v>
<v Speaker 5>of processed meat a day increases your</v>

2329
01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:14.980
<v Speaker 5>chance of developing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2330
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:16.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>day though,</v>

2331
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 5>it increases your chance of dying from</v>
<v Speaker 5>colorectal cancer by 40%.</v>

2332
01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a huge,</v>

2333
01:37:22.641 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 5>huge correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2334
01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2335
01:37:26.121 --> 01:37:27.770
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whole complex issue.</v>

2336
01:37:27.771 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Just in the same way cowspiracy when we</v>
<v Speaker 5>went into doing cowspiracy,</v>

2337
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:31.821
<v Speaker 5>we went in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2338
01:37:31.821 --> 01:37:33.530
<v Speaker 5>just looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at the information and just</v>

2339
01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.600
<v Speaker 5>presenting it all and just finding out</v>
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>

2340
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:38.690
<v Speaker 5>where's the study's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are their sources?</v>

2341
01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 5>And then we're doing the same thing with</v>
<v Speaker 5>this film.</v>

2342
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:42.110
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really shaping up to be,</v>

2343
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's heavy.</v>

2344
01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:47.840
<v Speaker 5>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got comic aspects of the same like</v>

2345
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:49.410
<v Speaker 5>cowspiracy does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2346
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:50.810
<v Speaker 5>super controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

2347
01:37:50.811 --> 01:37:53.460
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't tell people what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just provides the information that</v>

2348
01:37:53.461 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 5>allows people to make up their own</v>
<v Speaker 5>minds.</v>

2349
01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 5>And You bring up great points</v>

2350
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:57.960
<v Speaker 4>though about exercise and all of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2351
01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 4>And we'll also in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in consuming nutrient rich foods,</v>

2352
01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 4>like in saying that meat is the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well no one is always a big one.</v>

2353
01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Like the days the dairies just not</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking good for you.</v>

2354
01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tastes awesome.</v>

2355
01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Now unfortunately it's great with</v>
<v Speaker 4>cookies,</v>

2356
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not good for you.</v>

2357
01:38:11.551 --> 01:38:12.071
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2358
01:38:12.071 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 4>it's creates a lot of phlegm and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2359
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:17.040
<v Speaker 4>raw milk is better than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than homogenized,</v>

2360
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 4>pasteurized milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2361
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not the best shit for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2362
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 4>But my point being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can you isolate that it is the</v>

2363
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 4>consumption of meat causes cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the lack of nutrients from nutrient</v>

2364
01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:34.410
<v Speaker 4>dense foods along with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is it an imbalance in the diet or is</v>

2365
01:38:34.411 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 4>it meat causing cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2366
01:38:35.671 --> 01:38:36.630
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they did.</v>

2367
01:38:36.631 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 4>So that's a big part of it.</v>

2368
01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.280
<v Speaker 4>There's so much correlations to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tobacco industry that happened about 20</v>

2369
01:38:41.281 --> 01:38:42.720
<v Speaker 4>years ago to the meat and dairy</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

2370
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like how Keegan was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see these other studies that you'll</v>

2371
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:47.004
<v Speaker 4>hear of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2372
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:47.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2373
01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:48.870
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the butterfat is good for you.</v>

2374
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:50.730
<v Speaker 4>The cholesterol is good for the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

2375
01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grain brain.</v>

2376
01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.490
<v Speaker 4>And then you see who is funding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2377
01:38:53.491 --> 01:38:55.650
<v Speaker 4>you look deep into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

2378
01:38:55.651 --> 01:38:58.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that where the studies come from and</v>

2379
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.330
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the,</v>

2380
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:00.970
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2381
01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:03.240
<v Speaker 4>there's a new movie out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen merchants of doubt?</v>

2382
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.970
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's happening with this</v>

2383
01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you have to create his doubt and</v>

2384
01:39:08.581 --> 01:39:11.850
<v Speaker 4>people playing that movie if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people might not have seen it</v>

2385
01:39:11.851 --> 01:39:14.640
<v Speaker 4>and it's really an important movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it basically explores,</v>

2386
01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:16.350
<v Speaker 4>and that's a big part of this film and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happened.</v>

2387
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.440
<v Speaker 4>The tobacco industry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to prove that to,</v>

2388
01:39:18.441 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 4>to that cigarette smoking is going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill it.</v>

2389
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:23.970
<v Speaker 4>You just have to just put a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of doubt,</v>

2390
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.830
<v Speaker 4>just a little bit of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it just like,</v>

2391
01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 4>remember when butter was on the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and then everybody,</v>

2392
01:39:29.071 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>butter or you know,</v>

2393
01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:33.360
<v Speaker 4>just recently about how let us or bacon</v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

2394
01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more lettuce was more sustainable than</v>

2395
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Bacon and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

2396
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank God.</v>

2397
01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Now I can eat a bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just that little bit of doubt.</v>

2398
01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.280
<v Speaker 4>And if that's all you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then boom,</v>

2399
01:39:44.281 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 4>you got them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the tobacco industry did that for</v>

2400
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 4>years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just like you're talking about how</v>

2401
01:39:48.241 --> 01:39:51.840
<v Speaker 4>do they know these studies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's thousands of studies and</v>

2402
01:39:51.841 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 4>then there'll be one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

2403
01:39:52.711 --> 01:39:54.930
<v Speaker 4>three of these other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was one,</v>

2404
01:39:54.931 --> 01:39:55.410
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

2405
01:39:55.410 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the one I want to see it hired</v>

2406
01:39:57.421 --> 01:40:02.421
<v Speaker 4>these people to go on these shows and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and argue against the idea that tobacco</v>

2407
01:40:02.461 --> 01:40:06.390
<v Speaker 4>smoke was cancerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they did it in such a voice,</v>

2408
01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Juror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boisterous,</v>

2409
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.650
<v Speaker 4>loud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robust way that people started believing</v>

2410
01:40:11.651 --> 01:40:12.451
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now you have the,</v>

2411
01:40:12.451 --> 01:40:13.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Paleo and the,</v>

2412
01:40:13.481 --> 01:40:14.320
<v Speaker 4>the butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2413
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fat,</v>

2414
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:18.120
<v Speaker 4>the fat is good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have these very strong personalities</v>

2415
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:19.890
<v Speaker 4>that top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't people though that were doing</v>

2416
01:40:19.891 --> 01:40:22.650
<v Speaker 4>it about the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what was confusing and scary.</v>

2417
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:26.610
<v Speaker 4>These guys that they were working for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tobacco companies initially then</v>

2418
01:40:26.611 --> 01:40:29.190
<v Speaker 4>started doing it about issues with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

2419
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.350
<v Speaker 4>And you realize that the same people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2420
01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:33.240
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2421
01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is great.</v>

2422
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:35.580
<v Speaker 4>And then you find out where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting paid.</v>

2423
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:35.940
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2424
01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.770
<v Speaker 4>this is so transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2425
01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:39.180
<v Speaker 4>And then now it's the mean their</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

2426
01:40:39.181 --> 01:40:41.010
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like the last to fall of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

2427
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that's when it comes down to,</v>

2428
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:44.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2429
01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.410
<v Speaker 4>where a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's getting funded and where that</v>

2430
01:40:46.411 --> 01:40:48.840
<v Speaker 4>merchant of doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where were those guys working now?</v>

2431
01:40:48.841 --> 01:40:49.674
<v Speaker 4>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does this,</v>

2432
01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:50.371
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2433
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry where they're putting their of</v>

2434
01:40:53.411 --> 01:40:54.244
<v Speaker 4>marketing?</v>

2435
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>

2436
01:40:55.361 --> 01:40:57.910
<v Speaker 2>It's going to the one of most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the most powerful industry in the</v>

2437
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:00.300
<v Speaker 2>entire planet mean dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2438
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I think we can all agree that as human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

2439
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:08.620
<v Speaker 2>what we need for sure is access to</v>
<v Speaker 2>information about things that affect us</v>

2440
01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:10.660
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to health and when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to diet.</v>

2441
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.300
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you find out that studies,</v>

2442
01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>like I used to do this joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2443
01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>partnership for drug free America,</v>

2444
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 2>it was funded by alcohol and tobacco</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and pharmaceutical companies.</v>

2445
01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 2>That's where they got all their money</v>
<v Speaker 2>from and they would do these commercials</v>

2446
01:41:23.471 --> 01:41:25.390
<v Speaker 2>against pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said that's like hookers doing</v>

2447
01:41:25.391 --> 01:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>commercials against strippers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most ridiculous fucking shit</v>

2448
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.700
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you ever watched those proposed</v>

2449
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 2>postures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>

2450
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:35.080
<v Speaker 2>like the girl with the talking dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she comes home from school and her dogs</v>

2451
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:39.040
<v Speaker 2>toner stop getting high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's funded by pill companies.</v>

2452
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And the idea behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that could be legal,</v>

2453
01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.370
<v Speaker 2>that you can do that and then you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that commercial on television and</v>

2454
01:41:45.371 --> 01:41:48.610
<v Speaker 2>not say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey the pill co partnership for drug</v>

2455
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:50.440
<v Speaker 2>free America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>

2456
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Drug companies stopping other business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it is.</v>

2457
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And we need information and we needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be really clear.</v>

2458
01:41:58.871 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 2>And if you are trying to stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>information like that stupid fucking</v>

2459
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:05.770
<v Speaker 2>part of the Patriot Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try and stop information from getting</v>

2460
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 2>to people that is on American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2461
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.030
<v Speaker 2>That is non progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is something that we shouldn't</v>

2462
01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:17.530
<v Speaker 2>allow in this age of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't stop information when it</v>

2463
01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>pertains to the health and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2464
01:42:19.761 --> 01:42:23.860
<v Speaker 2>the ethical considerations of an entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>population of a country.</v>

2465
01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.660
<v Speaker 2>You just fucking can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

2466
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:28.280
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's again what our whole mission</v>

2467
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:30.500
<v Speaker 3>is just providing information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people say like,</v>

2468
01:42:30.501 --> 01:42:31.940
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tell people how to live their</v>

2469
01:42:31.941 --> 01:42:33.260
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm full on.</v>

2470
01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.060
<v Speaker 3>Don't tell people how to live it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you didn't.</v>

2471
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first way you get someone to put up</v>

2472
01:42:36.801 --> 01:42:39.440
<v Speaker 3>a wall is tell them what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like give them the information,</v>

2473
01:42:39.441 --> 01:42:41.480
<v Speaker 3>allow people to make their own minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what we're seeing.</v>

2474
01:42:41.481 --> 01:42:45.110
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing people making massive</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle changes and political changes</v>

2475
01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:47.810
<v Speaker 3>based off of our first film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cowspiracy um,</v>

2476
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:49.790
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the potential again,</v>

2477
01:42:49.791 --> 01:42:51.490
<v Speaker 3>is there for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for any film to do that,</v>

2478
01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.100
<v Speaker 3>just give the information unbiased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let people decide for themselves.</v>

2479
01:42:55.101 --> 01:42:57.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where I'm super excited about</v>

2480
01:42:57.051 --> 01:42:59.000
<v Speaker 3>the new film for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

2481
01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:01.670
<v Speaker 3>it's another chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another window into a world that we</v>

2482
01:43:01.671 --> 01:43:02.990
<v Speaker 3>haven't really gotten to see before.</v>

2483
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever there's money,</v>

2484
01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.770
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have someone who's</v>

2485
01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:11.530
<v Speaker 2>trying to make more of it and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop any information that gets out,</v>

2486
01:43:11.531 --> 01:43:13.270
<v Speaker 2>it's going to prevent them from making</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of it.</v>

2487
01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>And money's just sort of fines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes and cracks and leaks through.</v>

2488
01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of like a river or</v>

2489
01:43:21.641 --> 01:43:22.750
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2490
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 2>streams of water just finds a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this.</v>

2491
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at the end of the film where we</v>

2492
01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:32.020
<v Speaker 2>show that it was so dark in the making</v>
<v Speaker 2>the food of actually making it.</v>

2493
01:43:32.290 --> 01:43:32.861
<v Speaker 2>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2494
01:43:32.861 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 2>let's look if there's a glimmer of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we saw these,</v>

2495
01:43:35.201 --> 01:43:36.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these plants,</v>

2496
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:39.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond meeting the beyond egg.</v>

2497
01:43:39.071 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 2>And then we found out Bill Gates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2498
01:43:41.021 --> 01:43:42.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys from twitter,</v>

2499
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:46.360
<v Speaker 2>they're putting their money into these</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

2500
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Speaker 2>these new plant based foods because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this as the future.</v>

2501
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:50.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these billionaires look five,</v>

2502
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>10 years down the road</v>

2503
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.360
<v Speaker 5>and that's where they're putting their</v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

2504
01:43:53.361 --> 01:43:55.880
<v Speaker 5>So now the money's going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not ethically I nine for the</v>

2505
01:43:55.881 --> 01:43:57.500
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it because they see it's</v>

2506
01:43:57.501 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 5>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now this is also happening a few plants</v>

2507
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.660
<v Speaker 5>that have a full amino acid profile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2508
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:04.820
<v Speaker 5>There's only a few plants that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>complete proteins.</v>

2509
01:44:04.821 --> 01:44:07.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like Keywan hamp and there's a few</v>
<v Speaker 5>other ones.</v>

2510
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Well they all have a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all have all the amino acids.</v>

2511
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.770
<v Speaker 5>It's just they haven't been different</v>
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>

2512
01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:13.731
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2513
01:44:13.731 --> 01:44:17.690
<v Speaker 5>you have your 23 amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be high and six and low and you</v>

2514
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:20.360
<v Speaker 5>know the others,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they don't all have the same amino</v>

2515
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:22.110
<v Speaker 5>acids that meat does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2516
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:24.200
<v Speaker 5>So they have all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of them do.</v>

2517
01:44:24.201 --> 01:44:25.610
<v Speaker 5>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every plant that has protein,</v>

2518
01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 5>like Broccoli has protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Broccoli has all the amino acids</v>

2519
01:44:28.251 --> 01:44:28.820
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2520
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2521
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:30.410
<v Speaker 5>does as far as I know.</v>

2522
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what it is,</v>

2523
01:44:31.610 --> 01:44:33.800
<v Speaker 5>cause they used to be that belief that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to combine foods.</v>

2524
01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:34.421
<v Speaker 5>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2525
01:44:34.421 --> 01:44:36.620
<v Speaker 5>to eat brown rice and Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the truth is,</v>

2526
01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:40.430
<v Speaker 5>is that just eat a very diet and you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>the exact levels that you need.</v>

2527
01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.180
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the belief of in like that eating meat</v>

2528
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.220
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the,</v>

2529
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has the amino acids that are closest to</v>

2530
01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 5>our own proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2531
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:52.040
<v Speaker 5>well then that logically we should eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings.</v>

2532
01:44:52.041 --> 01:44:55.010
<v Speaker 5>That'd be the healthiest food to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not really the healthiest</v>

2533
01:44:55.011 --> 01:44:56.940
<v Speaker 5>food for people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would that be the case though?</v>

2534
01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.570
<v Speaker 5>That that's the whole basis of that like</v>
<v Speaker 5>meat,</v>

2535
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:02.360
<v Speaker 5>that's where the amino acids is arguing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2536
01:45:02.361 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And with what they're saying is that you</v>

2537
01:45:03.921 --> 01:45:06.620
<v Speaker 5>should eat what we've eaten up until</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

2538
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:11.060
<v Speaker 5>like all the thousands of years of human</v>
<v Speaker 5>development we've developed specifically</v>

2539
01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:12.410
<v Speaker 5>for certain diets.</v>

2540
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:15.170
<v Speaker 5>That's why biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you talk to people from different</v>

2541
01:45:15.171 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 5>parts of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might require different nutrients</v>

2542
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:20.000
<v Speaker 5>because their genetics have adapted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nutrients that are in their</v>

2543
01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:21.050
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2544
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2545
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:23.840
<v Speaker 5>So no one's saying that you should eat</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2546
01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:25.550
<v Speaker 5>And so it's kind of disingenuous</v>
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>

2547
01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:26.361
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2548
01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

2549
01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 5>but to say that we have to eat meat</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's often the argument is</v>

2550
01:45:30.621 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 5>that well we have to eat these foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're saying,</v>

2551
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:34.670
<v Speaker 5>I think what they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry to interrupt you,</v>

2552
01:45:34.671 --> 01:45:37.790
<v Speaker 5>but I think they're saying to optimize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to optimize your performance,</v>

2553
01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 5>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your vitality,</v>

2554
01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.130
<v Speaker 5>that animal based proteins are more</v>
<v Speaker 5>efficient.</v>

2555
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:47.780
<v Speaker 5>And that's the part or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>film goes into like efficiency,</v>

2556
01:45:47.781 --> 01:45:49.970
<v Speaker 5>efficiency in long endurance athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2557
01:45:49.971 --> 01:45:53.810
<v Speaker 5>say you're talking about ritual are</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scott Jurek,</v>

2558
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:54.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2559
01:45:54.250 --> 01:45:55.520
<v Speaker 5>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>longest,</v>

2560
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.730
<v Speaker 5>the most healthiest longer south athlete</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2561
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 5>Just Scott Jurek,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's strictly on a plant based Diet</v>

2562
01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:04.220
<v Speaker 5>because it's the most efficient form of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2563
01:46:04.221 --> 01:46:05.390
<v Speaker 5>converting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2564
01:46:05.391 --> 01:46:07.100
<v Speaker 5>But you're talking about endurance</v>
<v Speaker 5>athletes,</v>

2565
01:46:07.101 --> 01:46:09.080
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about skinny guys that</v>
<v Speaker 5>run a long time.</v>

2566
01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:11.810
<v Speaker 5>You're not spending an hour talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

2567
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.450
<v Speaker 5>look when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you looked at like mixed martial</v>

2568
01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:17.540
<v Speaker 5>artists for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or boxers or explosive athletes that</v>

2569
01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 5>have to optimize the physical capacity</v>
<v Speaker 5>of their body.</v>

2570
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:21.260
<v Speaker 5>There's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2571
01:46:21.261 --> 01:46:21.981
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2572
01:46:21.981 --> 01:46:25.640
<v Speaker 5>very few that have vegan diets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And few have tried it and they felt</v>

2573
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:26.560
<v Speaker 5>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2574
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:28.850
<v Speaker 5>John Fitch was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Fitch who did it,</v>

2575
01:46:28.851 --> 01:46:31.940
<v Speaker 5>I believe for ethical reasons also</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he wanted to try to optimize his</v>

2576
01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:34.790
<v Speaker 5>health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just found himself to be much weaker</v>

2577
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:37.580
<v Speaker 5>when it was on a Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big thing about that.</v>

2578
01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:39.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's the Mac Danzek,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

2579
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:40.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vegan.</v>

2580
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:41.930
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

2581
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.520
<v Speaker 5>mack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a good fighter,</v>

2582
01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.710
<v Speaker 5>never reached a championship level.</v>

2583
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 5>He was very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very intelligent guy and did it for all</v>

2584
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:53.660
<v Speaker 5>the right reasons and a real</v>
<v Speaker 5>environmentalist and I'm very aware of</v>

2585
01:46:53.661 --> 01:46:55.680
<v Speaker 5>guy and she's a real brilliant guy all</v>
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>

2586
01:46:56.010 --> 01:47:01.010
<v Speaker 5>but he never reached that championship</v>
<v Speaker 5>potential that some feel that you need</v>

2587
01:47:02.401 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 5>to eat animal based protein and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just an argument for that.</v>

2588
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's definitely,</v>

2589
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:07.950
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the big,</v>

2590
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 5>the big part of is that there's so few</v>
<v Speaker 5>vegan athletes right now.</v>

2591
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:13.140
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that is in a population there's</v>

2592
01:47:13.141 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 5>only 1% of vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know if that person,</v>

2593
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.230
<v Speaker 5>and what's the percent of percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an elite athlete,</v>

2594
01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:23.880
<v Speaker 5>right 0.01 add to elite athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What percentage of elite athletes are</v>

2595
01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:26.100
<v Speaker 5>vegans actually looking into that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you know,</v>

2596
01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 5>depending on what you're looking into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long durrance like when Carl Lewis,</v>

2597
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:31.740
<v Speaker 5>when he was at his peak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said he was completely vegan when</v>

2598
01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:32.610
<v Speaker 5>he's at his peak.</v>

2599
01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:34.390
<v Speaker 5>But he was also on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2600
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.273
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2601
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:38.190
<v Speaker 5>How does help?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2602
01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2603
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:40.890
<v Speaker 5>he was caught with something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was caught with some sort of a</v>

2604
01:47:40.891 --> 01:47:43.320
<v Speaker 5>stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was at the same time that Glen</v>

2605
01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.030
<v Speaker 5>Johnson was caught or Ben Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 5>rather,</v>

2606
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Ben Johnson was caught with</v>

2607
01:47:46.741 --> 01:47:48.630
<v Speaker 5>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carlos is caught with something too.</v>

2608
01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 5>And Carlos had been caught with other</v>
<v Speaker 5>things before.</v>

2609
01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2610
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.770
<v Speaker 5>when I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm Victor Conte in here,</v>

2611
01:47:53.771 --> 01:47:56.370
<v Speaker 5>it was with the ball ball co guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2612
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.560
<v Speaker 5>he sort of explained all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2613
01:47:58.561 --> 01:48:00.420
<v Speaker 5>the different modalities and methods at</v>
<v Speaker 5>these.</v>

2614
01:48:00.421 --> 01:48:02.850
<v Speaker 5>He's like every track and field athletes</v>
<v Speaker 5>dirty.</v>

2615
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.050
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all dirty.</v>

2616
01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:05.910
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was saying the same thing about</v>

2617
01:48:05.911 --> 01:48:07.950
<v Speaker 5>Tour de France.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like this idea that these guys are</v>

2618
01:48:07.951 --> 01:48:10.050
<v Speaker 5>doing it clean bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all dirty.</v>

2619
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.590
<v Speaker 5>So when you say these guys are doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing,</v>

2620
01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 5>they're on a plant based diet and epo</v>
<v Speaker 5>and testosterone and hgh and blood</v>

2621
01:48:18.841 --> 01:48:20.430
<v Speaker 5>doping and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like you said,</v>

2622
01:48:20.431 --> 01:48:21.930
<v Speaker 5>a lot going on everyone else's too.</v>

2623
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

2624
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:27.150
<v Speaker 5>So one thing that the strongest guy in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany puts a Patrick boot Patrik</v>

2625
01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:30.300
<v Speaker 5>strung guy in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one strong man,</v>

2626
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 5>his job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those barrel toss and characters,</v>

2627
01:48:33.930 --> 01:48:37.410
<v Speaker 5>world record holder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the yet has two Guinness Book of</v>

2628
01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 5>World Records for Yolk lifts and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>super beast.</v>

2629
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 5>100% Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

2630
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:44.490
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's,</v>

2631
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.740
<v Speaker 5>it's one aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2632
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:49.500
<v Speaker 5>You're saying like we're machines and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like put the right fuel in the</v>

2633
01:48:49.501 --> 01:48:51.480
<v Speaker 5>machine to run it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm the wrong guy to have this</v>

2634
01:48:51.481 --> 01:48:55.260
<v Speaker 5>conversation with you guys honestly</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I just don't know enough and I</v>

2635
01:48:55.261 --> 01:48:59.610
<v Speaker 5>would love to have some sort of someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who really understands human physiology.</v>

2636
01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.250
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't want to throw out</v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers cause there's so much editing</v>

2637
01:49:02.251 --> 01:49:04.140
<v Speaker 5>we're still going through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just blowing our mind though.</v>

2638
01:49:04.141 --> 01:49:05.520
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2639
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:07.920
<v Speaker 5>someone from the Paleo community that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>really small,</v>

2640
01:49:07.921 --> 01:49:10.120
<v Speaker 5>like a Rob Wolf guy would be a good guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk to you guys.</v>

2641
01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 5>And that's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that we're,</v>

2642
01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:15.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're even equipped to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make the arguments because we're not</v>

2643
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:16.581
<v Speaker 5>running to doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2644
01:49:16.581 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's the same thing with</v>

2645
01:49:17.881 --> 01:49:19.230
<v Speaker 5>cowspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People want to argue with us on</v>

2646
01:49:19.231 --> 01:49:20.250
<v Speaker 5>statistics and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>

2647
01:49:20.251 --> 01:49:21.860
<v Speaker 5>we're just reporting what other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

2648
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh boy it be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I wanted to get two guys together,</v>

2649
01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:27.540
<v Speaker 5>like a rob wolf and then a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's supporting the Vegan Diet,</v>

2650
01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:29.430
<v Speaker 5>who would those two?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Garth Davis,</v>

2651
01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.570
<v Speaker 5>Garth Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Davis.</v>

2652
01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Just because there's a few people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>just go off on the whole Paleo Paleo</v>

2653
01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:37.800
<v Speaker 5>thing from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a physiological level to,</v>

2654
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to every single level of what Paleo is</v>

2655
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:43.650
<v Speaker 5>actually really ate and what they will</v>
<v Speaker 5>consume that sort of that,</v>

2656
01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:46.530
<v Speaker 5>it's just the name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the problem is with the name</v>

2657
01:49:46.531 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 5>Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea</v>

2658
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.350
<v Speaker 2>of people eating things that are easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>digestible,</v>

2659
01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>that's normal food like lettuces and</v>
<v Speaker 2>grasses and vegetables and meats and</v>

2660
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 2>chicken and fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

2661
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 2>that's what their ideas about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Davis is a good one.</v>

2662
01:49:59.650 --> 01:49:59.910
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2663
01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:00.710
<v Speaker 2>he's a character too.</v>

2664
01:50:00.710 --> 01:50:01.790
<v Speaker 3>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be cool.</v>

2665
01:50:01.791 --> 01:50:02.211
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2666
01:50:02.211 --> 01:50:03.044
<v Speaker 3>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connie,</v>

2667
01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:05.600
<v Speaker 3>he's wanting to try to fly the wealth</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will give you a contact if you want</v>

2668
01:50:05.601 --> 01:50:05.961
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2669
01:50:05.961 --> 01:50:09.110
<v Speaker 3>people always complain that I have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>one sided conversations with people like</v>

2670
01:50:09.111 --> 01:50:12.170
<v Speaker 3>you guys and I don't bring anybody into</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm stuck trying to do it</v>

2671
01:50:12.171 --> 01:50:14.810
<v Speaker 3>myself and I'm feel equipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Garth Davis,</v>

2672
01:50:14.811 --> 01:50:17.750
<v Speaker 3>that's the one cool thing I think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>your show is that you have,</v>

2673
01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:20.810
<v Speaker 3>you have super eclectic guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have people from so many different</v>

2674
01:50:20.811 --> 01:50:21.644
<v Speaker 3>spectrums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2675
01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:25.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean again from from one end of,</v>

2676
01:50:25.371 --> 01:50:28.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hardcore Paleo sort of folks to,</v>

2677
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>to Yara friend retro who says hi by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>

2678
01:50:30.891 --> 01:50:32.480
<v Speaker 3>That dude is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>

2679
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Awesome Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

2680
01:50:33.411 --> 01:50:34.230
<v Speaker 3>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:50:34.230 --> 01:50:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Plant base and durrance athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I try to have an open mind</v>

2682
01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.040
<v Speaker 2>been as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible while trying to enjoy this</v>

2683
01:50:41.041 --> 01:50:44.180
<v Speaker 2>experience and watch what your health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes out loud,</v>

2684
01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:49.240
<v Speaker 2>what the health when it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll get two hours of sleep when,</v>

2685
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2686
01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'll definitely watch it 100%.</v>

2687
01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:58.380
<v Speaker 2>I think you guys did a fantastic job</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this documentary.</v>

2688
01:50:58.381 --> 01:50:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

2689
01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2690
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:02.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said that I think information is</v>

2691
01:51:02.941 --> 01:51:05.700
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when people were trying to deny</v>

2692
01:51:05.701 --> 01:51:09.110
<v Speaker 2>information or restrict information</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the worry that they're gonna</v>

2693
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:11.430
<v Speaker 2>lose money because they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something unethical,</v>

2694
01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:15.270
<v Speaker 2>that should be a fucking crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be a crime that you filmed</v>

2695
01:51:15.271 --> 01:51:17.610
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that shouldn't be a crime.</v>

2696
01:51:17.611 --> 01:51:20.150
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't be a crime that you show</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone kicking a fucking cow,</v>

2697
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.490
<v Speaker 2>beating over the head with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sledgehammer.</v>

2698
01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:22.403
<v Speaker 2>Like we have seen.</v>

2699
01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:25.140
<v Speaker 2>If you watch those videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be a crime to film.</v>

2700
01:51:25.141 --> 01:51:28.650
<v Speaker 2>That should be a crime to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it should be a crime to support</v>

2701
01:51:28.651 --> 01:51:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2702
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.800
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

2703
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:34.200
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's against what people want in this</v>

2704
01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.810
<v Speaker 2>day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the analogy of like finding</v>

2705
01:51:36.811 --> 01:51:38.640
<v Speaker 2>out that slaves make your genes is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2706
01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:40.650
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2707
01:51:40.651 --> 01:51:42.300
<v Speaker 2>it's probably worse because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating it,</v>

2708
01:51:42.690 --> 01:51:43.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2709
01:51:43.171 --> 01:51:46.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a different thing because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually becoming a part of your body is</v>

2710
01:51:46.291 --> 01:51:49.620
<v Speaker 2>just as bad or not worse or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>

2711
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Why am I quantifying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2712
01:51:52.410 --> 01:51:53.650
<v Speaker 2>is there anything else you guys would</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to say?</v>

2713
