1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I get the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never cashed the checks.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you get into comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are alive.</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll answer bad childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's freelance.</v>

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't get into that for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>you probably have a shitty act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>That is so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it lets you,</v>

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it lets you weren't seen as a child or </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard as a child and have this </v>

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>insatiable need to be seen and heard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be funny.</v>

10
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck were you doing in Vietnam?</v>

11
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>Because this is one of the reasons I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to talk to you about this </v>

12
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>before that I didn't want to see you </v>
<v Speaker 1>before this.</v>

13
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get you in and I'm glad</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about it before,</v>

14
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>but I went to your instagram page and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw these pictures of you working with </v>

15
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.251
<v Speaker 1>these children that have cleft palates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw these photos of you in </v>

16
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me what are you doing?</v>

17
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this charity called Operation</v>

18
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Smile and I'm usually working in animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>charities because people I think are </v>

19
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 2>usually the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had been helping people just seems</v>

20
00:00:55.381 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 2>to make more proliferate and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of charity stuff,</v>

21
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like I think that just why I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to get more involved as like,</v>

22
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be perfectly honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started not liking the person that I </v>

23
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started realizing I was the person who</v>

24
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God traffic.</v>

25
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like crazy today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

27
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.960

<v Speaker 1>what made you feel like you were going </v>

31
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>to a place that you didn't like or </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a person in life?</v>

32
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing like working with animals and </v>

34
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 2>going to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

36
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 2>parts of town that I wouldn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to to rescue animals and dogs.</v>

37
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 2>You start going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

38
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a real world outside this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truman show that we live in of the fake </v>

39
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 2>sets and the fake this and the fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and the fake,</v>

40
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makeup and the fake close every.</v>

41
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

42
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in a fun house,</v>

43
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when you're in this business,</v>

44
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up keeps me,</v>

45
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real person because TV shows that get </v>

46
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's TV shows,</v>

47
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.781
<v Speaker 2>I think it's writing fake scripts about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake people and fake lots and fake </v>

48
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 2>houses and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake edit bays.</v>

49
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just was like really?</v>

50
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about and knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:20.321
<v Speaker 2>way more than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then what I do know about neurology </v>

52
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 2>is that our brains acclimate to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment we're in.</v>

53
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this environment all the time.</v>

54
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 2>My brain is just going to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>acclimating accordingly.</v>

55
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

56
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it a little ways,</v>

57
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 2>if I have a small purse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only need a small purse.</v>

60
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 2>If I were a big purse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden I filled it up with </v>

61
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

62
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 2>it's like you kind of acclimate to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a.</v>

63
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>and so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

65
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the things that come out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth.</v>

66
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't like my inner monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the fact that I get annoyed</v>

67
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uber is,</v>

69
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not on fucking time.</v>

70
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

71
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.911
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of wanted to get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and like really get out </v>

72
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 2>there and not just like giving money for</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own selfish,</v>

73
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 2>like guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just going to give money.</v>

74
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I went to Vietnam for two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and did this.</v>

75
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:11.161
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Tokyo for a couple of days </v>

76
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:11.161
<v Speaker 2>before then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was actually really interesting.</v>

77
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

78
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.320
<v Speaker 2>when I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>wash the surgeries and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also cool because I don't know if</v>

80
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>you are at this ever went through this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

81
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I think I got sick of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just kind of was like,</v>

82
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of my making jokes.</v>

83
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of like.</v>

84
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about being around </v>

85
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 2>people that don't speak English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of strips you of your persona,</v>

86
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

89
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:48.301
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go through life like a </v>

90
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>sleep walking Zombie who's just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a bad impression on myself every </v>

91
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>day because it's so easy to do and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>find,</v>

92
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I felt like life was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>groundhog day bud,</v>

93
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workout jokes,</v>

94
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>

95
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bits,</v>

96
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bits,</v>

97
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure,</v>

98
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 2>insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>and I got a little bit sick of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhythm and I was like,</v>

100
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be something more deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

101
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were seekers and I was like thinking </v>

102
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 2>about my next special and the next thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write.</v>

103
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to just.</v>

104
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like my brain was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had this,</v>

105
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>there was like patterns and rhythms that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

106
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I keep going to the same place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatively.</v>

107
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:27.121
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go to a different place </v>

108
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.531
<v Speaker 2>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got to like challenge my brain and </v>

109
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:28.531
<v Speaker 2>throw some new shit at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and being around people that don't speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>English is really,</v>

111
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.330
<v Speaker 2>first of all have no idea who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another experience when you're </v>

112
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.811
<v Speaker 2>used to people knowing who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having expectations of you and thinking </v>

113
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be funny or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're known,</v>

114
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you have the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you wanted or not in a room,</v>

115
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk into a room and you have the </v>

116
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>power whether you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>having it or not,</v>

117
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 2>you just do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan walks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

119
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>be cool and everyone's trying to impress</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

120
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Everybody changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

121
00:04:56.741 --> 00:05:01.741
<v Speaker 2>So you never get to see people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic self because you inherently </v>

122
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>affect them with your presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

123
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the,</v>

124
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:10.011
<v Speaker 2>a term in science where it's impossible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to measure the thing because the </v>

125
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>measuring tool affects the amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

126
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

127
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:18.601
<v Speaker 2>So you never know how people really are </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your presence actually affects </v>

128
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they've never heard of you,</v>

129
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>which in Vietnam known for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of fans over there.</v>

130
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

131
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 2>so you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't rely on any of that shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've become used to relying on.</v>

133
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking to people that don't speak </v>

134
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you're like,</v>

135
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't use all my goto strategies,</v>

136
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>charm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation,</v>

137
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 2>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one cares.</v>

138
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it was really pretty,</v>

139
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

140
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about,</v>

141
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have your thoughts on Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mine,</v>

142
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I think are kind of probably going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>polarizing and get me in trouble because</v>

143
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a fucking mess over there.</v>

144
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 2>But there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when,</v>

145
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

146
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:05.651
<v Speaker 2>you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have more of a insight into what's </v>

147
00:06:05.651 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>real and what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>

148
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I also noticed that when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

149
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>both of my parents had strokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was awful obviously,</v>

150
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 2>but I liked the person I became after it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

151
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden when something tragic </v>

152
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.410
<v Speaker 2>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things become clear.</v>

153
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.801
<v Speaker 2>Your priorities become clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone asks you to go to lodge that </v>

154
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:23.801
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

155
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not like,</v>

156
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'll switch.</v>

157
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Like you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything becomes very black and white.</v>

158
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Do I want to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I not?</v>

159
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Is this an effective use of my time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>

160
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

161
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I just exposed myself to a little bit</v>

162
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not tragedy,</v>

163
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.360
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

164
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>and stop hanging out with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with fake problems and hang out </v>

165
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 2>and surround myself with real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe I'll stop thinking I have a </v>

166
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 2>bunch of problems I don't really have.</v>

167
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 3>I always love talking to you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably one of the most </v>

168
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 3>ruthlessly introspective people I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

169
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

170
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think you are,</v>

171
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 3>you don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretty brutally introspective.</v>

172
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thank you.</v>

173
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

174
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be as somby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

175
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Most people are just sleepwalking </v>
<v Speaker 2>through life and uh,</v>

176
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.570
<v Speaker 2>that does not happen.</v>

177
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have,</v>

178
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 3>you had very many psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

179
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I have</v>

180
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 2>event and I was going to do Iowasca last</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

181
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>but I had been on antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 2>and I only went on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a bummer and I'm actually want</v>

183
00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>to talk about this in my next special </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were,</v>

184
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 2>they were given to me because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>having trouble sleeping.</v>

185
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I had insomnia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I recently learned about how </v>

186
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>insomnia it sort of came about and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually really important.</v>

187
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wish that there were doctors out </v>

188
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.710
<v Speaker 2>there who studied shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like insomnia.</v>

189
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Usually people are insomniacs fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years ago,</v>

190
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 2>people in the tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tribal life before streetlights and</v>

191
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:52.591
<v Speaker 2>alarm systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were people who were responsible </v>

192
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:52.591
<v Speaker 2>for staying up all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else slept.</v>

193
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:56.761
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called the night watchers </v>

194
00:07:56.761 --> 00:07:58.500
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nightwatch would breed with night </v>

195
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>watchers and s essentially.</v>

196
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.580
<v Speaker 3>So you're a nightwatchman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be,</v>

197
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 3>that could be my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

198
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:08.191
<v Speaker 3>there's some people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't fall asleep till three in </v>

199
00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:08.191
<v Speaker 3>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know who never says that.</v>

200
00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 3>Who Farmers was never say that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking work true.</v>

201
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Do to dig holes all day today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the most I'd employed people.</v>

202
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

203
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I cannot sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's again because you haven't done </v>

204
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking well.</v>

205
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have three kids,</v>

206
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:21.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

207
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my insomnia is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>write something there.</v>

208
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel like as soon as I have kids or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

209
00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:26.650
<v Speaker 2>mine's off.</v>

210
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 3>It'll probably still stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

211
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'll be a mother so I'll never </v>

212
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 3>sleep the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an issue,</v>

213
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 3>but it's also a mental loop thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to bed and you have a </v>

214
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 3>mental loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

215
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get this.</v>

216
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I gotTa fucking get my shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really have to do this.</v>

217
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I really got to start this diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>really going to start a journal.</v>

218
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 3>There's a book that I need to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I need to write it.</v>

219
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I need to fucking start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I get out of bed right now and </v>

220
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:50.730
<v Speaker 3>start writing it and then that loop will</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck with you and keep you up.</v>

221
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Especially someone like you who's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper ambitious,</v>

222
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 3>you always have like 15 irons in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire</v>

223
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and you've got a fucking fireplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bellows.</v>

224
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.610
<v Speaker 1>You're stoking and you're on the phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

225
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

226
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

227
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>

228
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>We'll definitely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've almost got like too many points of</v>

229
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>focus where I imagine that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting down to a neutral point,</v>

230
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>it probably has a very difficult time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

231
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and I've also done a couple things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also our brains are not designed to </v>

232
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.731
<v Speaker 1>see the amount of light that we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're like the screens and our </v>

233
00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our brain produces cortisol.</v>

234
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 1>When they see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

235
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.871
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brain thinks our phone is the sun </v>

236
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:29.871
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wake up.</v>

237
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the new feature on iphones</v>
<v Speaker 1>were turns it down at 10:00</v>

<v Speaker 1>You could set it.</v>

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mine is now in black and white.</v>

240
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just going back to go back to the phone.</v>

241
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Black and white fucking typewriter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone sends you a picture,</v>

242
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.250
<v Speaker 1>then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be very hard to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you give her your phone?</v>

244
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I've turned a black and white because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>settings.</v>

246
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the colors in your phone,</v>

247
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>a trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of chemicals to be released in </v>

248
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>your brain that actually activate you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and entered entered.</v>

249
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>So ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a flower as your backdrop.</v>

250
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Flower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white.</v>

251

<v Speaker 1>See what the fuck George O'keeffe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean our big.</v>

252
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

253
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really.</v>

254
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an octopus vagina actually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>flower.</v>

255
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super into a like,</v>

256
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just if you understand how the brain </v>

257
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can usually hack,</v>

258
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 1>get a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like when you look at your </v>

259
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my phone,</v>

260
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be so addicted to it.</v>

261
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Now I just have no interest in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's black and white.</v>

262
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not giving me the dopamine and the </v>

263
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>chemicals that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

264
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Color.</v>

265
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 1>What color?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turning your phone black and white makes</v>

266
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it less attractive to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less addictive.</v>

267
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

268
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

269
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it is just the color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like,</v>

270
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortisol.</v>

271
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Adrenaline read produces adrenaline and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortisol,</v>

272
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm just like,</v>

273
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

274
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

275
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.940
<v Speaker 1>What is the setting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How have you changed?</v>

276
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 1>You go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

277
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never do it.</v>

278
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not try it?</v>

279
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Try it for a day because I'll have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little thing called discipline didn't </v>

280
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to have sex with that now.</v>

281
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>

282
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy and I've learned how to do</v>

283
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

284
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I've learned how to do it so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've rules that might not be your.</v>

285
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>What gives you dope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

286
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

287
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

288
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:28.011
<v Speaker 1>I could sit down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up in the morning and take a shit </v>

289
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:28.011
<v Speaker 1>and I'll look at that thing for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

290
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:29.120
<v Speaker 1>What are you looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reading?</v>

291
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading articles that I don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to read.</v>

292
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking just becomes like a cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do now is if I do it,</v>

293
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I look at the important stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over,</v>

294
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 1>do I have any work emails that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pertinent to check my work?</v>

295
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Email?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.090
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I have any text messages that are </v>

297
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>other I need to deal with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to deal with.</v>

298
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Shut it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it away,</v>

300
00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>walk away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I though might have a different </v>

301
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.250
<v Speaker 2>idea of what I need to deal with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I doubt I sometimes,</v>

302
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get sucked into stuff that's completely </v>

303
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.290
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary and frivolous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also an addiction.</v>

304
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm texting about a fucking baby shower </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm not even going to and I'm just </v>

305
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:11.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

306
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm difficult to get ahold of your,</v>

307
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.160
<v Speaker 2>but you're very self contained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little more and I'm in recovery.</v>

308
00:12:16.161 --> 00:12:21.161
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it for codependent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I sometimes struggle with the </v>

309
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:21.750
<v Speaker 2>discomfort or perceived as comfort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

310
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:23.840
<v Speaker 2>so I feel like I need to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's feelings sometimes.</v>

311
00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:26.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's harder a caretaker and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

312
00:12:26.331 --> 00:12:29.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why you love dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs and dogs.</v>

313
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Only the voiceless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only people.</v>

314
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Only like people that are can't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

315
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.320
<v Speaker 2>If you can help yourself and you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not my problem.</v>

316
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I've learned over the years that I only </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a certain amount of,</v>

317
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.420
<v Speaker 3>not just time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a certain amount of focus and that </v>

318
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 3>the less focused I give two things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really interested in,</v>

319
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 3>the more focused I'll have for things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I am interested in.</v>

320
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:58.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a real issue with my manager </v>

321
00:12:58.321 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 3>because I just fucking vanish for days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't answer phone calls.</v>

322
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got the same thing.</v>

323
00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:07.091
<v Speaker 2>I had the same thing just happened with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a manager who hadn't heard from me </v>

324
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:07.091
<v Speaker 2>because I went to Vietnam and I got back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like.</v>

325
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I recently learned that when someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>calls or texts you don't have to </v>

326
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.410
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

327
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we get in this obligatory sort </v>

328
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.141
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to respond to everything and it </v>

329
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:20.750
<v Speaker 2>was actually interesting going to Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that culture is,</v>

330
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:25.751
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using this word probably a </v>

331
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:27.620
<v Speaker 2>inappropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for lack of a better word,</v>

332
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.650
<v Speaker 2>codependent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so like having to take care of </v>

333
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.561
<v Speaker 2>everybody's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking to this guy on a </v>

334
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:37.571
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much respect for other </v>

335
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:37.571
<v Speaker 2>people's feelings and status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

336
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the plane on the way over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat next to the super interesting guy </v>

337
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.041
<v Speaker 2>who creates a tools for animators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I know like the stuff that makes </v>

338
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 2>cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

339
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.801
<v Speaker 2>I can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have the vernacular to </v>

340
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:52.801
<v Speaker 2>explain it.</v>

341
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:52.801
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he said it's really hard to do focus</v>

342
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:53.960
<v Speaker 2>groups in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

343
00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:55.340
<v Speaker 2>focus groups is when you go around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

344
00:13:55.341 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>is this working?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this not working?</v>

345
00:13:56.581 --> 00:14:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no one will respond until an </v>

346
00:14:01.581 --> 00:14:02.360
<v Speaker 2>elder response and everyone just agrees </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the elder.</v>

347
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to disagree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone older than you.</v>

348
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

349
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an article about the,</v>

350
00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:09.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>

351
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a couple Malaysian </v>
<v Speaker 2>airline flights that went down.</v>

352
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>They say it was pilot error because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>copilot was afraid to disagree with the </v>

353
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.760
<v Speaker 2>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pilot was wrong,</v>

354
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but because of the inherent respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your elders thing,</v>

355
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.800
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

356
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.240
<v Speaker 2>we're going to crash if you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the plane went down.</v>

357
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I came back and I was like,</v>

358
00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I'm not.</v>

359
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 2>And I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I was a little bit </v>

360
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Speaker 2>horrified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrified,</v>

361
00:14:38.931 --> 00:14:40.220
<v Speaker 2>not a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right word.</v>

362
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Saddened by this culture of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame over there.</v>

363
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 2>We have it in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if you disgrace your </v>

364
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.490
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just jump off a building.</v>

365
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

366
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people were jumping in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of trains that the only way they </v>

367
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:03.731
<v Speaker 4>could get them to stop jumping in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of trains when they shame their family </v>

368
00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:04.340
<v Speaker 4>was saying if people jump in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>trains,</v>

369
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bill your family for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cleanup.</v>

370
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 4>So that got them to stop because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

371
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:15.011
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't my family to have to get this </v>

372
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:16.421
<v Speaker 4>bill?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that will disgrace them even </v>

373
00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:18.551
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had to use their shame against </v>

374
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:20.120
<v Speaker 4>them as a way to get them to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>committing suicide.</v>

375
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple in China,</v>

376
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 4>apple had to put nets around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

377
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 4>So many people were jumping off it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's a real issue in and unto </v>

378
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.240
<v Speaker 4>itself because Apple's paying these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and they're living in this </v>

379
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 4>building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying dog shit.</v>

380
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have these factories over in </v>

381
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 4>China because it's an awesome place to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build phones.</v>

382
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Speaker 4>They have these factories over there </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they could pay people virtually </v>

383
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 4>nothing and have them work all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

384
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 4>I've been to China before just in </v>
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>

385
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.620
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>

386
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.680
<v Speaker 4>and I want to come from a judging place </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we obviously have our problems </v>

387
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:57.740
<v Speaker 4>in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

388
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.250
<v Speaker 4>it was just a really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when I went over there and </v>

389
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:03.250
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>

390
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:03.940
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone's,</v>

391
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>India is amazing.</v>

392
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:10.451
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's really poor and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>die of dysentery and yeah.</v>

393
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

394
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm a baby girls or have their head </v>
<v Speaker 4>smashed on rocks because of the dowery </v>

395
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:22.930
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like there's,</v>

396
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's this.</v>

397
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a documentary on I guess itunes.</v>

398
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.920
<v Speaker 4>It's about infanticide in China and </v>
<v Speaker 4>India because the dowery system.</v>

399
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.210
<v Speaker 4>So basically to have a child is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortune.</v>

400
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 4>I've had time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry to have a female because you have </v>

401
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 4>to pay someone to marry her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't work at your dad's family.</v>

402
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 4>And she's basically just like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>financial drain,</v>

403
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just terrifying.</v>

404
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.710
<v Speaker 4>So that goes on in China.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Still a terrifies me is that that's </v>

405
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 4>probably an ancient way of thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>behaving.</v>

406
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.020
<v Speaker 4>So like we look at today and we look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this world that we live in today and </v>

407
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>obviously we have a lot of issues with </v>
<v Speaker 4>equality and we have a lot of issues </v>

408
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 4>with racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a lot of issues with homophobia,</v>

409
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:09.120
<v Speaker 4>but whatever issues we have are nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to the,</v>

410
00:17:09.121 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 4>the echoes of our past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at something like that</v>

411
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 4>and when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are hate crimes,</v>

412
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 4>that's an individual person against an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual person that's not like a </v>

413
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.740
<v Speaker 4>socially accepted thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smaller the Nazi,</v>

414
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not endorsing hate crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you know someone,</v>

415
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 4>a beats up a gay guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people think it was bad that he did</v>

416
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 4>that and they go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's one person who's fucked up,</v>

417
00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 4>not entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like,</v>

418
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:36.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a good idea.</v>

419
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Speaker 4>The last echoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last reverberations that our way is </v>

420
00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:48.251
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you guys have to become </v>

421
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:48.251
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just a little bit like,</v>

422
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:48.520
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

423
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like fact that they're not America.</v>

424
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these different cultures </v>

425
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.291
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's fascinating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's different parts of the world </v>

426
00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:59.601
<v Speaker 3>where people have figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way to behave and they follow </v>

427
00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:02.501
<v Speaker 3>this different pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've carved this groove and all the </v>

428
00:18:02.501 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 3>young people follow into this groove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give or take,</v>

429
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.570
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you look at different parts </v>

430
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.271
<v Speaker 3>of the world and you experienced their </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture or you look at how they're </v>

431
00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:14.361
<v Speaker 3>behaving and how they dress and how they</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak and how they live their lives and </v>

432
00:18:14.361 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 3>their traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is absolutely fascinating.</v>

433
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:19.350
<v Speaker 3>These patterns of repeatable behavior to</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeating,</v>

434
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 3>repeating patterns that exists all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and that they're so different.</v>

435
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 3>They're different in Thailand and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are in Germany.</v>

436
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Totally different parts of the world are</v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with like having more humor </v>

437
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 3>or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or more,</v>

438
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more discipline or more artistic </v>

439
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

440
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.230
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

441
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.670
<v Speaker 2>it's so and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

442
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I always forget how young of a </v>

443
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.700
<v Speaker 2>country we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are a minute old compared to a</v>

444
00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:45.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of these countries do you now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>

445
00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:49.640
<v Speaker 2>they have thousands of years of history </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have and,</v>

446
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's like how can you hold on to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool traditions and patterns and </v>

447
00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.430
<v Speaker 2>then release the more backwards once and</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve and grow,</v>

448
00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

449
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just wild.</v>

450
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean in Vietnam and it from Vietnam is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so beautiful you're going to love it.</v>

451
00:19:04.761 --> 00:19:06.590
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

452
00:19:06.591 --> 00:19:11.591
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see poverty and air that no one </v>

453
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:16.361
<v Speaker 2>can breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's wearing masks because they </v>

454
00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:16.361
<v Speaker 2>can't inhale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no emissions regulations.</v>

455
00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

456
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh right,</v>

457
00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:21.230
<v Speaker 2>white trust fund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids are like Vietnam,</v>

458
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they say because they can come back </v>

459
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

460
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Williamsburg,</v>

461
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Brooklyn or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that why people love </v>

462
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:30.130
<v Speaker 3>talking about Brown people being </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

463
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like look like you're not a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>person because you think Vietnam is </v>

464
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.390
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Just admit that it's,</v>

465
00:19:37.391 --> 00:19:38.480
<v Speaker 2>it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to.</v>

466
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we,</v>

467
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.470
<v Speaker 2>we fucked it up a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our fault of what we did in the </v>

468
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.470
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

469
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

470
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.690
<v Speaker 2>gave me a lot of anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

471
00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:48.260
<v Speaker 2>because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

472
00:19:48.261 --> 00:19:49.430
<v Speaker 2>it was just like the hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

473
00:19:49.431 --> 00:19:54.431
<v Speaker 2>we were in a hospital and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we needed four of this machine that puts</v>

474
00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:59.741
<v Speaker 2>babies to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pediatric anesthesia is very different </v>

475
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.730
<v Speaker 2>than regular anesthesia and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially bringing people to the brink</v>

476
00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:06.731
<v Speaker 2>of death and then bringing them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like incredibly fascinating a job.</v>

477
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.430
<v Speaker 2>And they had one of the machines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need the pediatric </v>

478
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.030
<v Speaker 2>anesthesiologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we need four and they're like,</v>

479
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just don't have them in this country.</v>

480
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.150
<v Speaker 2>We just can't do surgery on babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not in our purview.</v>

481
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:25.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not own our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

482
00:20:25.431 --> 00:20:26.600
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to,</v>

483
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.740
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

484
00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:30.650
<v Speaker 2>the kids come in with cleft palates and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleft lips,</v>

485
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 2>which the baby is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have trouble breastfeeding.</v>

486
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.960
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cleft palates just,</v>

487
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:40.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of this opening here in a </v>

488
00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:41.810
<v Speaker 2>separation as a malnutrition in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>womb.</v>

489
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yep,</v>

490
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>exposure to genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

491
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 2>exposure to pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure all that napalm we dropped in </v>

492
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.620
<v Speaker 2>the seventies didn't really help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

493
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.430
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in America it still happens,</v>

494
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 2>but it's handled right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's handled.</v>

495
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 2>It comes out three months later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fixed,</v>

496
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>no big deal over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's never fixed.</v>

497
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:05.911
<v Speaker 2>And when you see adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see men that are 50 come in with </v>

498
00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:08.670
<v Speaker 2>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant cleft lips and palates and </v>

499
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.821
<v Speaker 2>they've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's even worse in third world </v>

500
00:21:11.821 --> 00:21:14.101
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially African countries because </v>

501
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:14.101
<v Speaker 2>there's such a stigma attached to it.</v>

502
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Not only is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.770
<v Speaker 2>in our brains to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's different than me and </v>

504
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.960
<v Speaker 2>ostracized or stigmatized someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a lot of more religious </v>

505
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think you're the devil or your,</v>

506
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a job.</v>

507
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.250
<v Speaker 2>You're completely sequestered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're thrown out of your family.</v>

508
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

509
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:34.370
<v Speaker 2>and this is gonna sound Super Corny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

510
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 2>but I guess for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

511
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I connected so much to maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're comedians.</v>

512
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

513
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

514
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to grow up in a third </v>
<v Speaker 2>world country.</v>

515
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing to deal with poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stress,</v>

516
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.260
<v Speaker 2>but if you can't smile like the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only real medicine we have,</v>

517
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has universal medicine of like</v>

518
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.660
<v Speaker 2>laughing and smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we connect to people.</v>

519
00:21:57.661 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

520
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was frustrating and uh,</v>

521
00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:07.201
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing that's </v>

522
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 2>frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're Joaquin Phoenix.</v>

523
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Look at Joaquin Phoenix</v>

524
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

525
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.670
<v Speaker 4>He has a cleft lip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think Stacy Keach.</v>

526
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it weird that Joaquin Phoenix got </v>
<v Speaker 4>it mean he's like a</v>

527
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.820
<v Speaker 2>be genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:25.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also America has its history was </v>

529
00:22:25.821 --> 00:22:25.821
<v Speaker 2>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

530
00:22:25.821 --> 00:22:25.821
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

531
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're by no means squeaky clean.</v>

532
00:22:28.501 --> 00:22:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're exposed to a lot of.</v>

533
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:36.290
<v Speaker 4>We are the exact Mirka Mirka.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

534
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll like this.</v>

535
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked,</v>

536
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.130
<v Speaker 4>we talked about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just sort of like how we essentially </v>

537
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:45.130
<v Speaker 4>always had to drink alcohol when before </v>
<v Speaker 4>we had pottable water,</v>

538
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.800
<v Speaker 4>people were just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

539
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 4>what people drank wine and of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>flats they carried around to keep from </v>

540
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.480
<v Speaker 4>getting travelers disease for water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he would call it.</v>

541
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's completely,</v>

542
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

543
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.880
<v Speaker 4>what people were such assholes who were </v>
<v Speaker 4>just hammering,</v>

544
00:22:58.881 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 4>everyone was hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean actually when you think about it,</v>

545
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a miracle that someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Ford built a car,</v>

546
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 4>like it's like as if you were sober,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to be like Rockefeller.</v>

547
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like the couple people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were sober just basically became like </v>

548
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.500
<v Speaker 4>the biggest sober people who drink </v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee.</v>

549
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.660
<v Speaker 4>It literally took over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

550
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.220
<v Speaker 4>because I mean everybody was shit faced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's crazy.</v>

552

<v Speaker 5>It was so broken and then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>break dancing.</v>

581
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.310
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

582
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 5>back then it was just a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people were basically like monkeys,</v>

583
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My parents were like,</v>

584
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:50.670
<v Speaker 5>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

585
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 5>monkey have the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't touch that.</v>

586
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 5>Don't touch that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't understand things now.</v>

587
00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's a little bit of a </v>

588
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 2>pendulum swing to the other way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter parents.</v>

589
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.060
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was um,</v>

590
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:07.061
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this thing about how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>designer who's making more dangerous </v>

591
00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>jungle gyms for kids because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten too safe.</v>

592
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.870
<v Speaker 5>So the daughter broke her arm of jungle </v>
<v Speaker 5>gym.</v>

593
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should call this person.</v>

594
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 5>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not safe.</v>

595
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.750
<v Speaker 5>Like jungle gyms are just more </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenging or something like,</v>

596
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

597
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:25.721
<v Speaker 5>Like it was something about real problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with jungle gyms is you need to </v>

598
00:25:25.721 --> 00:25:30.010
<v Speaker 5>understand what your capabilities are </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the only way to find that out as to </v>

599
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.680
<v Speaker 5>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're falling on these metal bars.</v>

600
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.880
<v Speaker 5>You could fucking die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like kids that break their arm easily.</v>

601
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Kids don't die all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or they do know they do.</v>

602
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 5>Kids die all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you have kids,</v>

603
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 5>you sort of pay attention to that kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of shit and you realize like,</v>

604
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids fall on their head and die.</v>

605
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.580
<v Speaker 5>Like it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not paying attention and the </v>

606
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.011
<v Speaker 5>kids get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't understand boundaries and </v>

607
00:25:57.011 --> 00:25:59.261
<v Speaker 5>limitations and physical as a parent </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'm obsessed with this because </v>

608
00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm already like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not too close to having a</v>

609
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.240
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I froze my eggs.</v>

610
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So if anyone wants to send some sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

611
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>now that you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm,</v>

612
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:13.530
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm learning about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm asking where are you </v>

613
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:13.530
<v Speaker 2>from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

614
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Where are you from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slovenia.</v>

615
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Indiana will come in a cup for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really just trying to ascertain </v>

616
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.150
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like DNA and how strong it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

617
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.950
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that um,</v>

618
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read a book called the continuum </v>

619
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.641
<v Speaker 2>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a parenting saying about </v>

620
00:26:29.641 --> 00:26:29.641
<v Speaker 2>like babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be held by anyone.</v>

621
00:26:29.641 --> 00:26:30.460
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be their mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>

622
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:35.461
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we should always just be being</v>
<v Speaker 2>held and sort of were designed to men </v>

623
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:40.291
<v Speaker 2>and women kind of weren't supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live together like we're supposed to </v>

624
00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:42.961
<v Speaker 2>kind of fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you go off and then all the </v>

625
00:26:42.961 --> 00:26:42.961
<v Speaker 2>women lived together and help raise all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids.</v>

626
00:26:42.961 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>

627
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was something interesting in </v>

628
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.490
<v Speaker 2>that because I'm the first three years a</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood's a,</v>

629
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child's ability to believe in their </v>

630
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.911
<v Speaker 2>own faculties essentially to trust other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and to feel like they're are </v>

631
00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:03.680
<v Speaker 2>heard and seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on how much eye contact and </v>

632
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:03.680
<v Speaker 2>physical touch they get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

633
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause basically touching is going like </v>

634
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you,</v>

635
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 2>you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

636
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 2>and the less touch that eye contact they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

637
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:13.101
<v Speaker 2>the more invisible they feel and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>date more dangerous they feel the world </v>

638
00:27:13.101 --> 00:27:13.101
<v Speaker 2>is for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

639
00:27:13.101 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 2>And there's this great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll love this.</v>

640
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm John Bowlby's theory of attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when babies crawl,</v>

641
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as for noble apes is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll crawl a foot and then the look </v>

642
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 2>back and see if dad still looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

643
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call another foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still there,</v>

644
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:27.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

645
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Babies turn around and check in and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>if on the fourth foot I turn around in,</v>

646
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 2>data is looking at his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

647
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 2>that's as far as I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's dangerous after four feet,</v>

648
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 2>that's as far as I'll go where he'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>still be there for me.</v>

649
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.220
<v Speaker 2>So then we also are sort of world in </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort zone is designed based on when </v>

650
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 2>your child loses your eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've just been sort of learning about</v>

651
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:54.801
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in lieu of like cell phones </v>

652
00:27:54.801 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 2>being the new alcoholism for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like parents</v>

653
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 1>just on their phone while their kids are</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the playground.</v>

654
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

655
00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

656
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing how many people just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to anything but their </v>

657
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.571
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I see it constantly and I see it </v>

658
00:28:08.571 --> 00:28:11.091
<v Speaker 1>when people are by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it when people with their </v>

659
00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:11.091
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see when people with their friends.</v>

660
00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:11.640
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you gone to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant?</v>

661
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:16.641
<v Speaker 1>You see a table full of people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's on their phone and no one's </v>

662
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:16.641
<v Speaker 1>talking to the people right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

663
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Did have you done like colleges </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently?</v>

664
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>

665
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I stopped more than a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

666
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

667
00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:31.031
<v Speaker 1>I think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Miami was the last one I </v>

668
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:31.031
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did with Joey Diaz,</v>

669
00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I think the coconut Grove Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

670
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

671
00:28:37.511 --> 00:28:39.610
<v Speaker 1>thank God they closed because there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many fights breaking out.</v>

672
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.150
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally told them that I would never</v>

673
00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:43.610
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here again.</v>

674
00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:48.611
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you people are so dominant over work </v>

675
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:48.611
<v Speaker 1>here again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were laughing.</v>

676
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:48.611
<v Speaker 1>I got you laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

677
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the dumbest fucking audience in </v>

678
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a guy do cocaine.</v>

679
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I was opening for like Steve Byrne or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some like Craig's shoemaker,</v>

680
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was opening for like 10 years </v>

681
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.770
<v Speaker 1>ago and someone was doing cocaine on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table while I was on the call.</v>

682
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe it will they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened with that place is they </v>

683
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.070
<v Speaker 1>started giving away free tickets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you give away seconds.</v>

684
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yourself.</v>

685
00:29:11.141 --> 00:29:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

686
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Those are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you paper the room,</v>

687
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you get terrible audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

688
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:21.610
<v Speaker 2>for awhile I was trying to give free </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickets to people who couldn't afford </v>

689
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.600
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd always say my comps,</v>

690
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.430
<v Speaker 2>like I have 10 comps in like the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere.</v>

691
00:29:25.431 --> 00:29:28.070
<v Speaker 2>This actually happened in La Jolla and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would tweet out like,</v>

692
00:29:28.071 --> 00:29:33.071
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you can't afford to come to the </v>

693
00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:33.071
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send me an email telling me why and I'll</v>

694
00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:33.071
<v Speaker 2>get you tickets and I would check it </v>

00:30:01.501 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this probably isn't even you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right before the show,</v>

715
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking through my emails.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm running a little late and where do I</v>

719
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:31.650
<v Speaker 4>park?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It went from like Ajit,</v>

00:30:31.651 --> 00:30:34.900
<v Speaker 4>like total,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all and like respect and adulation.</v>

721
00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:39.901
<v Speaker 4>You're probably not even going to check </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and like I'm sure this will never </v>

722
00:30:39.901 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 4>have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I became his assistant.</v>

723
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a microcosm of a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was courting you.</v>

724
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Then he got me and like went from </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally and then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Totally switched.</v>

728
00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:56.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like as soon as you give someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>something for free,</v>

729
00:30:56.301 --> 00:30:58.730
<v Speaker 4>they stop respecting it.</v>

732
00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:05.540
<v Speaker 3>someone just through email because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to sort of ascertain,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Kevin's very incisive,</v>

775
00:32:38.051 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very,</v>

776
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.520

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like kind of quiet and it </v>

778
00:32:45.521 --> 00:32:45.521
<v Speaker 4>doesn't speak a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he does,</v>

779
00:32:45.521 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 4>it's just exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the truth.</v>

00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 4>Like he's just so real like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

781
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 4>he said something once because he was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road with me for awhile and like 35,</v>

782
00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:57.581
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes into all my sets at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy would just snap and start yelling </v>

783
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:03.071
<v Speaker 4>at me and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens is they're like </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>

787
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:09.551

<v Speaker 4>fuck them or their mother or something.</v>

789
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:16.090
<v Speaker 4>And they just see you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like all of a sudden you just </v>

790
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 4>become a woman who's yelling at them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not allowed to talk back.</v>

791
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 4>One guy just we'll snap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always happens.</v>

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 4>where I'm sure you had one pennies up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make dinner.</v>

812
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 4>You guys have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're changed our.</v>

814
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.240
<v Speaker 4>And so I just said it and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

815
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 4>And then the guy went from like </v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>

816
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:44.180
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then as soon as I said that joke,</v>

817
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 4>he just looked at me and he went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so we can pay for your shit.</v>

818
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh Oh.</v>

819
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 4>And from then on out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just like everything I said,</v>

820
00:34:56.001 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 4>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's fucking,</v>

821
00:34:57.051 --> 00:35:02.051
<v Speaker 4>you did it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's because if you didn't fucking </v>

822
00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:02.051
<v Speaker 4>spend so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's literally,</v>

823
00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:04.360
<v Speaker 4>he's in the front row lawn and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that loan by himself,</v>

824
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 4>by himself and you know that moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>where someone's heckling and you're </v>

825
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if only I can hear them,</v>

826
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 4>I'll keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if the audience can hear them,</v>

827
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I finally had to,</v>

828
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 4>you had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the lawyer comedy store,</v>

829
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:19.280
<v Speaker 4>there's like a window into the street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he went outside and just stood in the</v>

830
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:21.320
<v Speaker 4>window and stared at me for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

831
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Remember he was just standing there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

832
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think,</v>

833
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I think comedy can really trigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger people.</v>

834
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's you're drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're out.</v>

835
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:39.461
<v Speaker 4>You have someone talking about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's willing to go to a comedy by </v>

836
00:35:39.461 --> 00:35:39.461
<v Speaker 4>himself</v>

837
00:35:39.461 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit in the front row already have red </v>

838
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 1>flags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kick that person out right away.</v>

839
00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that emailed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got different guys.</v>

840
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

841
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He emailed and yeah,</v>

842
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.870
<v Speaker 1>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

843
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you have a connection with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably thinking he's going to be </v>

844
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 1>in love with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to straighten you out.</v>

845
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 1>So you're a little too mouthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a little too talkative.</v>

846
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:57.120
<v Speaker 1>You have too many opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

847
00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking.</v>

848
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I know Yo Berko girls love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

849
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that think that people </v>

850
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>need to be put in check and that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

851
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>

852
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the story now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to tell you who it is.</v>

853
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I guess.</v>

854
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get it right,</v>

855
00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to know until after if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it right,</v>

856
00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:27.451
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

857
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Because now I'm probably gonna do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

858
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this thing,</v>

859
00:36:32.441 --> 00:36:34.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that exactly what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

860
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there is this thing</v>

861
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.780
<v Speaker 4>the same way women sometimes meet a man </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

862
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I can fix him when he's probably not </v>
<v Speaker 4>broken and is happy and fine or like </v>

863
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:53.521
<v Speaker 4>I'll whip him into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear my friends say it all the time </v>

864
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:53.521
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

865
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:53.521
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fine.</v>

866
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:54.220
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's happy.</v>

867
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.140
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to fix him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't think he's broken.</v>

868
00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think sometimes guys with me or like </v>

869
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll tame her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'll break her,</v>

870
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'll,</v>

871
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

872
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.560
<v Speaker 4>there was this comedian who sent me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>message on,</v>

873
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was when I was on facebook or</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't my space.</v>

874
00:37:11.231 --> 00:37:15.730
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those who I would always </v>
<v Speaker 4>see around and I'm pretty elusive.</v>

875
00:37:15.731 --> 00:37:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Like you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't get,</v>

876
00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:19.000
<v Speaker 4>we don't haven't got to hang at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy store that much,</v>

877
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.780
<v Speaker 4>but like I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in and I'm out less,</v>

878
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less so now like I would hang now </v>

879
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.671
<v Speaker 4>because like cool people are there now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you were gone it was kind of </v>

880
00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:30.220
<v Speaker 4>toxic in there and it's intense and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>like fun.</v>

881
00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Now it's little more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

882
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:37.050
<v Speaker 4>and so I just get in and do my set and </v>
<v Speaker 4>leave because I was trying to do a </v>

883
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.050
<v Speaker 4>couple sets of night and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

884
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.490
<v Speaker 4>I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

885
00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:41.050
<v Speaker 4>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we wouldn't flirt,</v>

886
00:37:41.051 --> 00:37:41.850
<v Speaker 4>but it would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

887
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:43.780
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of person who wants to give you</v>

888
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.620
<v Speaker 4>tags.</v>

889
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.800
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

890
00:37:47.801 --> 00:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>what you should say there and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

891
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.660
<v Speaker 4>and I get this message that was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>rage,</v>

892
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:58.130
<v Speaker 4>like a rage rage email that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

894
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.280
<v Speaker 4>the basic jest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how it started,</v>

895
00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:07.760
<v Speaker 4>but it ended in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what makes you come.</v>

896
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.300

<v Speaker 1>like it was like,</v>

897
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.750

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>that in come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I still have the screen grab of</v>

899
00:38:19.261 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 1>it because I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I said to dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what makes me.</v>

901
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like this Alpha thing,</v>

902
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 4>like it was like a Alpha reaction I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

903
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:34.020
<v Speaker 4>or something like I just need to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>you shame you or something.</v>

904
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:35.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

905
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 2>well that's an alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that?</v>

906
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:42.811
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it take for you to say that </v>

907
00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:42.811
<v Speaker 2>to a girl?</v>

908
00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:43.400
<v Speaker 3>The crazy person who usually it's self </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed,</v>

909
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 3>like delusional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delusional narcissism or something </v>

910
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.701
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Narcissistic to just to reach out like </v>

911
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:51.701
<v Speaker 3>that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

912
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:55.910
<v Speaker 3>you know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are an accoutrement or you are like </v>

913
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.910
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

914
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.850
<v Speaker 3>you're a piece of wardrobe in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

915
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want him to try you on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

916
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Like you like he's upset like you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life and it's not.</v>

917
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you doing what I want you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

918
00:39:09.771 --> 00:39:11.150
<v Speaker 3>In my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life,</v>

919
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.390
<v Speaker 2>clinical narcissism is that everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extension of you and if you're not </v>

920
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.450
<v Speaker 2>doing what I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're acting out.</v>

921
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

922
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

923
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

924
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:26.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a classic example of why </v>

925
00:39:26.071 --> 00:39:28.231
<v Speaker 3>Comedians don't like to work with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>good comedians because they don't want </v>

926
00:39:28.231 --> 00:39:29.100
<v Speaker 3>anybody else doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

927
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want anybody.</v>

928
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be all about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many bad comedians do we know </v>

929
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.690
<v Speaker 3>that take the fucking force people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the road with them.</v>

930
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 3>The worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>

931
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 3>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

932
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad that you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

933
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 3>do you hate your audience?</v>

934
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 2>People I think were the funniest because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

935
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 2>my audience is paying money and you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to laugh to want to have fun.</v>

936
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I have to watch them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

937
00:39:54.461 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't benefit me to have less </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented people around me.</v>

938
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:02.761
<v Speaker 2>I'd actually do the opposite to a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I tried to hire people who </v>

939
00:40:02.761 --> 00:40:02.761
<v Speaker 2>are more talented than me in every area </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life,</v>

940
00:40:02.761 --> 00:40:03.520
<v Speaker 2>so that it makes me look better.</v>

941
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's again,</v>

942
00:40:04.921 --> 00:40:09.921
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're weirdly introspective in that </v>

943
00:40:09.921 --> 00:40:11.811
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people that get </v>

944
00:40:11.811 --> 00:40:12.450
<v Speaker 3>into comedy because of all the scars of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their childhood,</v>

945
00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:14.370
<v Speaker 3>like who we're talking about and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

946
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.390
<v Speaker 3>They don't heal those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead they just find workarounds.</v>

947
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.660
<v Speaker 3>They find a way where they can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>express themselves and and so it's </v>

948
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.090
<v Speaker 3>almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

949
00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:29.091
<v Speaker 3>I told Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed the world like they never come </v>

950
00:40:29.091 --> 00:40:31.611
<v Speaker 3>to a neutral point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never get over the childhood where </v>

951
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:31.611
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

952
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:31.611
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what am I doing?</v>

953
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Is there a benefit to what I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

954
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Should I just stop?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm healthy now,</v>

955
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.380
<v Speaker 3>should I just stop what I'm doing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>should I use what I'm doing and just </v>

956
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.450
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it and have a good time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize that I probably got</v>

957
00:40:42.451 --> 00:40:47.451
<v Speaker 3>here because of an unhealthy obsession </v>
<v Speaker 3>or because of a bad childhood or </v>

958
00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:52.281
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that I'm kind of moving past </v>

959
00:40:52.281 --> 00:40:55.011
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I could use this position to just </v>

960
00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:55.011
<v Speaker 3>have some fun</v>

961
00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:59.720
<v Speaker 2>in exactly what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you just made it so clear to me </v>

962
00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.050
<v Speaker 2>what I was not being clear about in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the,</v>

963
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you bring unfunny people on the road </v>

964
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.861
<v Speaker 2>years really funny comparatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so all of a sudden you've created </v>

965
00:41:10.861 --> 00:41:11.710
<v Speaker 2>this little world for yourself where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>become this king of the idiots,</v>

966
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 2>but if you were to step outside that </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

967
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 2>you're all of a sudden at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food chain,</v>

968
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 2>like you create a world where at the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the food chain,</v>

969
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.840
<v Speaker 2>which is why it was important to me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to other countries,</v>

970
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:24.910
<v Speaker 2>be around people that have no idea who I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am,</v>

971
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.540
<v Speaker 2>that I don't pay that don't think I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

972
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 2>That can you understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very humbling and then you're </v>

973
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.710
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

974
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 2>who am without all this stuff</v>

975
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 4>without achievements and money and car </v>
<v Speaker 4>or what a car,</v>

976
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:40.610
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

977
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.910
<v Speaker 4>because I'm afraid that I might do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>by accident.</v>

978
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.530
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you have people around you </v>

979
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:50.530
<v Speaker 4>who are paid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are afraid to say no to you,</v>

980
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.280
<v Speaker 4>that's how you stop getting funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone around you is like,</v>

981
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 4>like I saw Chris Rock at the store </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants,</v>

982
00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you have this where he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on,</v>

983
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not the Oscars or something.</v>

984
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 4>And he got on stage and he said </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that was just like,</v>

985
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry I'm late.</v>

986
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:04.750
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

987
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 4>my car was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find a spot for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never was like,</v>

989
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.290
<v Speaker 4>ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

990
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:14.650
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please don't laugh unless I say </v>

991
00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 4>something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please treat me like I'm normal.</v>

992
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

993
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 4>that's how comics stopping funny is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people enable the and you know,</v>

994
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 4>they use it when you get so big like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

995
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

996
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.490
<v Speaker 4>people stop as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean your audience I'm sure is really,</v>

997
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

998
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Well we can all be guilty of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

999
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:36.420
<v Speaker 3>I think just what you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like navigating all these landmines </v>

1000
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.860
<v Speaker 3>that success can setup for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put It,</v>

1001
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:42.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are better land minds than </v>

1002
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.540
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still landmines and the landmines of</v>

1003
00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:48.541
<v Speaker 3>fame or particularly intoxicating </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when someone has a bunch of fans</v>

1004
00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:50.830
<v Speaker 3>that say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1005
00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:52.570
<v Speaker 3>you know Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck faces here.</v>

1006
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.620

1007
00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:55.300
<v Speaker 3>it's Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go run up to you.</v>

1008
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you're so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1009
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a picture with me.</v>

1010
00:43:00.281 --> 00:43:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1011
00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes this thing where you,</v>

1012
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1013
00:43:04.691 --> 00:43:05.980
<v Speaker 3>you get accustomed to that</v>

1014
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.160
<v Speaker 4>so myopic and you forget that there's 6 </v>
<v Speaker 4>billion people that don't have</v>

1015
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.200
<v Speaker 3>any fucking idea who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if Mike fuck face is around Tony </v>

1016
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald face and Tony Mick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick face is more famous like Tony </v>

1017
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Minute dictations a movie out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then Mike Fuck.</v>

00:43:21.271 --> 00:43:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Face gets really mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Tony Big Dick face.</v>

1019
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever seen those guys before?</v>

1020
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Both</v>

1021
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 4>represented by Barry Katz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they just left.</v>

1022
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.740
<v Speaker 4>They're doing his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted the three yards,</v>

1024
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that sort of.</v>

1025
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.080
<v Speaker 4>I literally found myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's also,</v>

1026
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 4>if you do achieve anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter because you're just </v>

1027
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 4>comparing yourself some with more </v>
<v Speaker 4>achievements.</v>

1028
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 4>So I'm recreating this feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>failure at every level of success and </v>

1029
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.460
<v Speaker 4>recreating this unhappiness at every </v>
<v Speaker 4>level where I have no real problems.</v>

1030
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1031
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:00.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have my bullshit problem.</v>

1032
00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 4>They're fake problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1033
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:02.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1034
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:03.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents are sick.</v>

1035
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of,</v>

1036
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real things,</v>

1037
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:07.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1038
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can pay the bill to get them.</v>

1039
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I literally am going through this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where it's like nursing homes and </v>

1040
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 4>care for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for older people.</v>

1041
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:18.200
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck,</v>

1042
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 4>do people pay for this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to go on tour to pay for it.</v>

1043
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1044
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:25.580
<v Speaker 4>thank God I get to do that for a living </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the casinos and shit.</v>

1045
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:27.440
<v Speaker 4>But it's a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1046
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my dad is,</v>

1047
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a vet.</v>

1048
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at the vet facilities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just like,</v>

1049
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.120
<v Speaker 4>are you fund</v>

1050
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where vets go.</v>

1051
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 5>The guys that fucking lost their limbs </v>
<v Speaker 5>for our country,</v>

1052
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.200
<v Speaker 5>this is where you're putting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's her dying fucking </v>

1053
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:42.200
<v Speaker 5>facility.</v>

1054
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.880
<v Speaker 3>We had to do these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did these benefits,</v>

1055
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:48.910
<v Speaker 3>these events called fight for the troops</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we did these for the intrepid in </v>

1056
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.140
<v Speaker 3>intrepid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>center for excellence,</v>

1057
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.770
<v Speaker 3>which is sounds cool and establishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

1058
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.840
<v Speaker 3>They've the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these facilities,</v>

1059
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
<v Speaker 3>they're creating these state of the art </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilities to deal with people with </v>

1060
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.111
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injuries and so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed us all these guys and it's </v>

1061
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:10.420
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See these people like with their wives </v>

1062
00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.811
<v Speaker 3>and their children and their families </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're trying to rehabilitate them </v>

1063
00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:17.411
<v Speaker 3>and then going through all these steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was more disheartening than </v>

1064
00:45:17.411 --> 00:45:21.041
<v Speaker 3>anything was to realize that all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff is privately funded because the </v>

1065
00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:25.000
<v Speaker 3>United States government just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't allocate enough money to </v>

1066
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.790
<v Speaker 3>treatment of these troops when they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

1067
00:45:25.791 --> 00:45:30.791
<v Speaker 3>They just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to raise all this money for </v>

1068
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:30.791
<v Speaker 3>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So while we're doing this,</v>

1069
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:35.571
<v Speaker 3>like they wanted us to talk about it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of it and I have to </v>

1070
00:45:35.571 --> 00:45:39.791
<v Speaker 3>measure myself because it's on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television and it's what I want to say </v>

1071
00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:43.730
<v Speaker 3>is this is fucking crazy that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a fight to raise.</v>

1072
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.910
<v Speaker 3>We're going to give people brain damage </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that we can</v>

1073
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.020
<v Speaker 5>no raise money for brain damage and </v>
<v Speaker 5>raise the money for all the weapons you </v>

1074
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.450
<v Speaker 5>that they really seem to find money for </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1075
00:45:52.451 --> 00:45:54.790
<v Speaker 5>but not for the humans that use the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weapon but these guys.</v>

1076
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.880
<v Speaker 5>But it's so ironic in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>because these people are fighting.</v>

1077
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.110
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they're fighting.</v>

1078
00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.980
<v Speaker 5>So like a bunch of people got knocked </v>
<v Speaker 5>out in the show.</v>

1079
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.370
<v Speaker 5>So they got some brain damage and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously they're competing,</v>

1080
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.070
<v Speaker 5>it's their decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1081
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.990
<v Speaker 5>they're going for glory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The trying to make it as a fighter,</v>

1082
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:16.410
<v Speaker 5>but were the end result is they're this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're getting pounded on so that we </v>

1083
00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.340
<v Speaker 5>can make money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1084
00:46:19.341 --> 00:46:21.970
<v Speaker 5>So they could help people who have brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>damage.</v>

1085
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a must.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the most Chinese finger trap.</v>

1086
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the amount of brain damage you</v>

1087
00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:32.190
<v Speaker 5>get from MMA is so minuscule and </v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to an ied,</v>

1088
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the fuck do we not set money aside </v>

1089
00:46:37.631 --> 00:46:38.050
<v Speaker 5>for this?</v>

1090
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.150
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could there be what?</v>

1091
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.890
<v Speaker 5>Find out what every congressman gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find out what everybody's.</v>

1092
00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 5>Every senator gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chop a chunk of that shit out and send </v>

1093
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:48.760
<v Speaker 5>it to the intrepid center.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1094
00:46:48.761 --> 00:46:53.761
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be a way that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>gotta be some fucking red tape and </v>

1095
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:57.601
<v Speaker 5>bureaucracy that you can cut and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could send some of that money to help </v>

1096
00:46:57.601 --> 00:47:01.051
<v Speaker 5>take care of these people that you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>forcing to go overseas and fight these </v>

1097
00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:03.190
<v Speaker 5>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A friend of mine who was in the army,</v>

1098
00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.230
<v Speaker 5>he told me that the statistic on vets </v>
<v Speaker 5>committing suicide,</v>

1099
00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

1100
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.190
<v Speaker 5>I want to say yours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I want to say.</v>

1101
00:47:12.191 --> 00:47:14.050
<v Speaker 5>What's one every like seven minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1102
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.430
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that.</v>

1103
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Jamie can look it up,</v>

1104
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's more people die of 22 a day.</v>

1105
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty two a day in 2012 more US </v>

1106
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:28.990
<v Speaker 5>soldiers committed suicide than were </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed in.</v>

1107
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

1109
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.440
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1110
00:47:35.441 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too crazy.</v>

1111
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1112
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1113
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.380
<v Speaker 2>where is my soy milk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed.</v>

1114
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 2>It's only 22 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was.</v>

1115
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was one every seven minutes</v>

1116
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's an average.</v>

1117
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is some days I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing statistics around on this.</v>

1118
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1119
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.620
<v Speaker 5>Talking about people that have served.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just know too many.</v>

1120
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 5>I know too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to too many guys and I,</v>

1121
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to too many people that,</v>

1122
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality of it is so bleak.</v>

1123
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1124
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.840
<v Speaker 2>from what little I know about it is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1125
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:10.020
<v Speaker 2>and then the drone guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a real nightmare because there's all </v>

1126
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 2>this Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1127
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:13.780
<v Speaker 2>normally when you are in combat and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back,</v>

1128
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:18.781
<v Speaker 2>you do a physical neutralization period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you go to Germany or some for like </v>

1129
00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:22.891
<v Speaker 2>five days and like they chill you out </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go back to your family and </v>

1130
00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Speaker 2>kids after you've just been combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these drone guys,</v>

1131
00:48:24.281 --> 00:48:29.281
<v Speaker 2>not only is the technology is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced that they're seeing all these </v>

1132
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 2>women and children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in the fog of war,</v>

1133
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't just see like threat threat </v>

1134
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.211
<v Speaker 2>threat because when you are getting shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a kid is might as well be a guy with </v>

1135
00:48:36.211 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 2>a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1136
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 2>so these guys are seeing these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting shot super close up.</v>

1137
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.930
<v Speaker 2>They're not able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're seeing their own guys get shot,</v>

1138
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:48.960
<v Speaker 2>like they're seeing it and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstairs to their wife and kids and </v>

1139
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 2>there's just no period for their brains </v>
<v Speaker 2>to acclimate to it.</v>

1140
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:55.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a serious atrophy of a drone </v>

1141
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 2>pilots and they're just raise the wages </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it so that it'll attract more because</v>

1142
00:48:56.891 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>so few people want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really to doing it in your basement like</v>

1143
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:03.120
<v Speaker 2>a video game just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1144
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.640
<v Speaker 2>is actually even more traumatic oddly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also the suicide rate.</v>

1145
00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it's even worse among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers that didn't kill anyone.</v>

1146
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have guilt and shame about </v>

1147
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1148
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:21.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from what I've talked to with guys that </v>

1150
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.070
<v Speaker 5>were in the seals are rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>special operatives guys,</v>

1151
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.400
<v Speaker 5>is that those guys have way less issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seals and rangers.</v>

1152
00:49:28.621 --> 00:49:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because first of all,</v>

1153
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.300
<v Speaker 5>mentally they're going to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>durable.</v>

1154
00:49:33.301 --> 00:49:33.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.600
<v Speaker 5>It's never the strongest guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always the most.</v>

1156
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1157
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:40.380
<v Speaker 5>those guys are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mentally more durable.</v>

1158
00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:45.381
<v Speaker 5>They have a better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have way deeper and more intense </v>

1159
00:49:45.381 --> 00:49:48.420
<v Speaker 5>comradery than the average person does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then on top of that,</v>

1160
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.160
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're proactive.</v>

1161
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.320
<v Speaker 5>They're the ones who were hunting down </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad guys.</v>

1162
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.360
<v Speaker 5>They're not waiting for people to attack</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1163
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:59.390
<v Speaker 5>They're going after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a totally different kind of </v>

1164
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.181
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if they plot a mission and they're </v>

1165
00:50:02.181 --> 00:50:02.250
<v Speaker 5>going to go fuck somebody up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're,</v>

1166
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.600
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're hunting.</v>

1167
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.120
<v Speaker 5>They're not being hunted when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>being hunted.</v>

1168
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.940
<v Speaker 5>That's where the stress comes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Food,</v>

1169
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to send you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably already read it.</v>

1170
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.950
<v Speaker 2>It's called Sapiens I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1171
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about anxiety and this a book you </v>

1172
00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.830
<v Speaker 2>just touched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a different one.</v>

1173
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I realized I had been texting you too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many books.</v>

1174
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:31.420
<v Speaker 4>both can fill out to say most girls </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1176
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>naked photos,</v>

1177
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:35.050
<v Speaker 4>new tags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said science books,</v>

1178
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no wonder I'm fucking alone.</v>

1179
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1180
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.730
<v Speaker 4>it's about anxiety and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have anxiety,</v>

1181
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:45.731
<v Speaker 4>I have anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like anxiety is actually talks </v>

1182
00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:45.731
<v Speaker 4>about sort of the origin of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>

1183
00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:49.960
<v Speaker 4>it's two pronged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is because I had a lot of shame </v>

1184
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.360
<v Speaker 4>about anxiety too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And anxiety,</v>

1185
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.090
<v Speaker 4>shame about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why am I anxious?</v>

1186
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're actually supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxious,</v>

1187
00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as by the laws of survival of the </v>

1188
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.501
<v Speaker 4>fittest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fittest were the ones that were </v>

1189
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:02.501
<v Speaker 4>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1190
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:02.501
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the anxious,</v>

1191
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:03.080
<v Speaker 4>hypervigilant people were the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

1192
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fucking tiger we should move.</v>

1193
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.800
<v Speaker 4>And the ones that didn't have anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>just got eaten alive.</v>

1194
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 4>And you're definitely one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>watchers.</v>

1195
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've definitely,</v>

1196
00:51:10.071 --> 00:51:11.070
<v Speaker 4>I've had anxiety.</v>

1197
00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 4>They come and watch sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're up at night.</v>

1198
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:15.180
<v Speaker 4>It's why we've got weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.110
<v Speaker 4>You're also a scene of a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you live a night life.</v>

1200
00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have adrenaline,</v>

1201
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who grew up in hectic homes who </v>

1202
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 4>produced Adrenalin young usually have an</v>
<v Speaker 4>adrenaline addiction.</v>

1203
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:27.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely have that.</v>

1204
00:51:27.771 --> 00:51:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because your body is producing so much,</v>

1205
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:30.570
<v Speaker 4>John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's addictive.</v>

1206
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 4>You must huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

1207
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 4>to your point just now is there was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought.</v>

1208
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Of course I hadn't thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not smart enough to,</v>

1209
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:43.511
<v Speaker 4>but I have never known that humans are </v>
<v Speaker 4>not designed to be at the top of the </v>

1210
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:47.711
<v Speaker 4>food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only at the top of the food chain </v>

1211
00:51:47.711 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 4>because we have weapons and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have weapons is because we had really</v>

1212
00:51:48.351 --> 00:51:51.230
<v Speaker 4>large brains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was actually not helpful at all.</v>

1213
00:51:51.231 --> 00:51:56.231
<v Speaker 4>It's really inefficient and uneconomical</v>
<v Speaker 4>for energy because I guess our brains </v>

1214
00:51:56.231 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 4>burned like 25 or 30 percent of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>calories or something.</v>

1215
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 4>So chimpanzees and apes head smaller </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains.</v>

1216
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:02.420
<v Speaker 4>They were able to climb trees and avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>threats.</v>

1217
00:52:02.421 --> 00:52:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Like a big brain is like a disaster </v>
<v Speaker 4>except that we invented tools,</v>

1218
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.640
<v Speaker 4>so we sort of not based on merit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We superficially,</v>

1219
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 4>once we embedded tools jumped to the top</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the food chain,</v>

1220
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:17.861
<v Speaker 4>but we don't deserve to be there because</v>
<v Speaker 4>without weapons a lot of species would </v>

1221
00:52:17.861 --> 00:52:20.210
<v Speaker 4>kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can figure out weapons.</v>

1222
00:52:20.211 --> 00:52:21.920
<v Speaker 4>So of course we deserve to be there </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally.</v>

1223
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as the weapons are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're vulnerable.</v>

1224
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.040
<v Speaker 4>So vulnerable to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes to a lot because we're not truly at </v>

1225
00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 4>the top of the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We only are at the top of the food chain</v>

1226
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 4>if we have a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's that anxiety.</v>

1227
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 4>A turtle without a shell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the second you drop your weapon,</v>

1228
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.020
<v Speaker 4>you're in the middle of the food channel</v>
<v Speaker 4>and drop it.</v>

1229
00:52:41.021 --> 00:52:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Bitch.</v>

1230
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not as agile as you fucking weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you stay alive.</v>

1231
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:49.140
<v Speaker 4>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the anxiety.</v>

1232
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:54.300
<v Speaker 4>Hold the fucking weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't drop it and be and keep your shit </v>

1233
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 4>together and keep on fucking high alert </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the second,</v>

1234
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 4>if your back is to Elian and the weapons</v>
<v Speaker 4>pointing this way,</v>

1235
00:52:58.071 --> 00:53:01.810
<v Speaker 4>you're still gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the lines are problematic.</v>

1236
00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 4>Even if you have a weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1237
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eat Bolus for fucking breakfast.</v>

1238
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.500
<v Speaker 4>This balance of the second you run out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of bullets,</v>

1239
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:10.820
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1240
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1241
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 4>when you think about what made a human a</v>
<v Speaker 4>human,</v>

1242
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.050
<v Speaker 4>it's really fascinating because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes like what came first,</v>

1243
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:23.051
<v Speaker 4>the chicken or the egg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what were we like when we will </v>

1244
00:53:23.051 --> 00:53:23.051
<v Speaker 4>Australia pacificus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1245
00:53:23.051 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 4>they have these depictions of us and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we looked like all hairy and</v>

1246
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 5>with fucking sloped foreheads and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were pretty close to people but not </v>

1247
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:36.111
<v Speaker 5>really people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you really look at the fossil </v>

1248
00:53:36.111 --> 00:53:39.441
<v Speaker 5>record,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they understand that these were </v>

1249
00:53:39.441 --> 00:53:41.810
<v Speaker 5>only talking about this kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you and I for a couple of hundred </v>

1250

<v Speaker 5>thousand years.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So recent.</v>

1252

00:54:24.881 --> 00:54:26.180
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what they come up,</v>

1269
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.260
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1270
00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:32.350
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really afraid that if I had met </v>

1271
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:34.061
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm going to lose my foot </v>

1272
00:54:34.061 --> 00:54:35.441
<v Speaker 2>fetish demo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had this pain in my foot and I </v>

1273
00:54:35.441 --> 00:54:37.400
<v Speaker 2>think we're probably a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar you much more so.</v>

1274
00:54:37.401 --> 00:54:39.740
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain.</v>

1275
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.260
<v Speaker 2>He just learned it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind and go to doctors growing up.</v>

1276
00:54:42.261 --> 00:54:44.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just like suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I caught on fire.</v>

1277
00:54:44.211 --> 00:54:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's basically like how my family</v>

1278
00:54:47.361 --> 00:54:47.570
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

1279
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:52.570
<v Speaker 2>You just suck it up and you man up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had this pain in my foot or my,</v>

1280
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:58.130
<v Speaker 2>like my big toe and then my third toe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once every two weeks,</v>

1281
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.340
<v Speaker 2>like real bad and it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a stabbing,</v>

1282
00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:02.630
<v Speaker 2>awful pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just was like,</v>

1283
00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:03.290
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my foot,</v>

1284
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.500
<v Speaker 2>like once every two weeks my foot has </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a spasm and it lasts for like,</v>

1285
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:11.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two minutes and then I get through </v>

1286
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:13.091
<v Speaker 2>it and I was in a writer's room one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my feet were up on the table and </v>

1287
00:55:13.091 --> 00:55:14.360
<v Speaker 2>then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the pain came and I was like,</v>

1288
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.170
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and two minutes later I'm like,</v>

1289
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:19.130
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like,</v>

1292
00:55:20.901 --> 00:55:23.080

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this thing,</v>

1294
00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I have this foot spasm that happens once</v>
<v Speaker 2>every two weeks.</v>

1295
00:55:26.571 --> 00:55:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just like my foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone was like,</v>

1296
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a thing.</v>

1297
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.520
<v Speaker 2>That's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get,</v>

1298
00:55:31.521 --> 00:55:36.521
<v Speaker 2>go to a podiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time I've ever went to a </v>

1299
00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:36.521
<v Speaker 2>podiatrist and he gave me an extra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1300
00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:36.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an extra foot.</v>

1301
00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you have an but even extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>bone in your foot between your second </v>

1302
00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:41.630
<v Speaker 2>and third toe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1303
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.530
<v Speaker 2>it's basically just remanence of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>an android</v>

1304
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.020
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now is it?</v>

1305
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.160
<v Speaker 5>It's not bone spurs like a broken foot</v>

1306
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.260
<v Speaker 2>quarterly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like an extra.</v>

1307
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:57.970
<v Speaker 2>You can't really see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like an extra bone right here.</v>

1308
00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one think.</v>

1309
00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1310
00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:04.300
<v Speaker 2>because we used to have more bones in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our feet and you're just like,</v>

1311
00:56:04.301 --> 00:56:07.690
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was not that long ago.</v>

1312
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Why would we have extra bones though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1313
00:56:11.141 --> 00:56:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Something about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1314
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll find out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something about the webbing or </v>

1315
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1316
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.200
<v Speaker 5>My friend Steve Rinella went to Bolivia </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he stayed with Toumani,</v>

1317
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 5>the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tribe and Bolivia.</v>

1318
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 5>And they don't wear shoes and they live </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the rainforest and their feet,</v>

1319
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:35.020
<v Speaker 5>their feet are splayed out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interestingly,</v>

1320
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:38.190
<v Speaker 5>our feet are like this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kinetic or is it worn from rights?</v>

1321
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:43.260
<v Speaker 5>Worn from writing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's just walking constantly </v>

1322
00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.951
<v Speaker 5>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like our feet are like this where </v>

1323
00:56:46.951 --> 00:56:47.060
<v Speaker 5>their feet are spread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like their toes are spread out.</v>

1324
00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 5>Women's in America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all.</v>

1325
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all getting old.</v>

1326
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:55.000
<v Speaker 5>So many girls I see in their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their toes are taken left and right.</v>

1327
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.070
<v Speaker 5>They're just trying to run away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

1328
00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 5>These fucking shoes that don't show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not shaped like a foot cocktail.</v>

1329
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 5>Shrimp who's fucking feet are shaped </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that Asian bound.</v>

1330
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 5>That's like they have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1331
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.310
<v Speaker 5>That's what these Toumani people.</v>

1332
00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:15.090
<v Speaker 5>Rinella was there and he was walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the woods with these people and </v>

1333
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is incredible.</v>

1334
00:57:15.461 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 5>Because they've never had shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have any shoes.</v>

1335
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.780
<v Speaker 5>And if you give them shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try them on.</v>

1336
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:20.550
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

1337
00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 5>And they throw it aside and they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>these thick,</v>

1338
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.460
<v Speaker 5>thick soles of their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1339
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Confirm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just constantly.</v>

1340
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.760
<v Speaker 5>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly like you keep saying my </v>

1341
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:32.760
<v Speaker 5>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>

1342
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.930
<v Speaker 5>we acclimate to where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I want to have the thick,</v>

1343
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:39.931
<v Speaker 5>thick sole in my personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be that person as the.</v>

1344
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be the one who has the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pha is like can fall apart.</v>

1345
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1346
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be this like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1347
00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:51.390
<v Speaker 5>do you have like Stevia?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't.</v>

1348
00:57:51.391 --> 00:57:56.391
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started realizing I had all these </v>

1349
00:57:56.391 --> 00:57:57.070
<v Speaker 5>fucking needs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think change means that we see</v>

1350
00:57:57.071 --> 00:58:00.330
<v Speaker 5>around us constantly because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 5>socially enforced.</v>

1351
00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:05.370
<v Speaker 5>It's so like coconut milk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>soy milk and did a $6 latte and it </v>

1352
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 5>becomes normal after a while and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1353
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:10.471
<v Speaker 5>this is not fucking normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also comforting to like behave in these </v>

1354
00:58:10.471 --> 00:58:14.221
<v Speaker 5>patterns that we've already seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes you feel like you're a normal </v>

1355
00:58:14.221 --> 00:58:14.890
<v Speaker 5>person and it makes us feel like because</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're designed to be part of a tribe and</v>

1356
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 5>to fit in and standing out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like produces,</v>

1357
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stress because it means we're less safe.</v>

1358
00:58:20.951 --> 00:58:22.620
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want to like,</v>

1359
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 5>because you drive around and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1360
00:58:23.831 --> 00:58:25.510
<v Speaker 5>oh this fucking asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole asshole.</v>

1361
00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of those assholes.</v>

1362
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to remove myself from the </v>

1363
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 5>situation and go watch kids have surgery</v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1364
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of that,</v>

1365
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:35.890
<v Speaker 5>these asshole things like the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>bro rage and all that jazz.</v>

1366
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:38.200
<v Speaker 5>A lot of that goes away when you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>small town.</v>

1367
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

1368
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 5>In Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I've found,</v>

1369
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 5>and I was only in boulder for a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>

1370
00:58:44.711 --> 00:58:46.590
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was there,</v>

1371
00:58:46.591 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people drive way more polite.</v>

1372
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:53.970
<v Speaker 5>They're way nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they let people in and they don't </v>

1373
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 5>cut people off as much stone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1374
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:55.050
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1375
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 5>That too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's less of them.</v>

1376
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 5>There's only 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people in town.</v>

1377
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:06.480
<v Speaker 5>So when you have a small community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all there's less diffusion of </v>

1378
00:59:06.971 --> 00:59:11.971
<v Speaker 5>responsibility because you and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>person is probably going to see each </v>

1379
00:59:11.971 --> 00:59:14.701
<v Speaker 5>other again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I give someone the finger on the </v>

1380
00:59:14.701 --> 00:59:17.941
<v Speaker 5>highway on the four or five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the odds I'm going to meet </v>

1381
00:59:17.941 --> 00:59:17.941
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do it again?</v>

1382
00:59:17.941 --> 00:59:18.550
<v Speaker 5>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably there's less like accountable.</v>

1383
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 5>We can be more anonymous and more.</v>

1384
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 3>You have more responsibility as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1385
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if you see someone pulled over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the road,</v>

1386
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:29.410
<v Speaker 3>you have more desire to pull over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>help</v>

1387
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:30.640
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like tribal.</v>

1388
00:59:30.641 --> 00:59:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really like a tribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>

1389
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Like there was these people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing their car the other day and they</v>

1390
00:59:36.611 --> 00:59:38.680
<v Speaker 3>were on the side of the road and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

1391
00:59:38.681 --> 00:59:39.270
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut,</v>

1392
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.900
<v Speaker 3>get out of the car and help them push </v>
<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>

1393
00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.030
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I watched them do it.</v>

1394
00:59:43.031 --> 00:59:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1395
00:59:43.391 --> 00:59:44.440
<v Speaker 3>they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got it.</v>

1396
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.380
<v Speaker 3>It's up on the hill there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it's up on the,</v>

1397
00:59:46.381 --> 00:59:47.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the curb there.</v>

1398
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.340
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was thinking like if this was a </v>

1399
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.620
<v Speaker 3>small town for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd pull over and I was thinking that at</v>

1400
00:59:53.621 --> 00:59:58.621
<v Speaker 3>that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the time that I spent living </v>

1401
00:59:58.621 --> 00:59:58.621
<v Speaker 3>in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1402
00:59:58.621 --> 01:00:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed at how polite people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the less people like in the </v>

1403
01:00:03.971 --> 01:00:08.971
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was in this town in the </v>

1404
01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:08.971
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would wave when you would go by and</v>

1405
01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 3>people lift their hand up when you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive by,</v>

1406
01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.750
<v Speaker 3>he'd pass each other and everybody and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got used to doing it and we all did it,</v>

1407
01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:18.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you were driving this way or that </v>

1408
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.731
<v Speaker 3>person driving that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will lift your hand up and you wave </v>

1409
01:00:20.731 --> 01:00:20.731
<v Speaker 3>to them because there's not that many of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see in La.</v>

1410
01:00:20.731 --> 01:00:25.680
<v Speaker 3>I think they're so fucking many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we lose the idea of value of,</v>

1411
01:00:26.591 --> 01:00:31.591
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our fellow humans because our fellow </v>

1412
01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:31.591
<v Speaker 3>humans become a bird fight.</v>

1413
01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:31.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Become a burden.</v>

1414
01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:34.270
<v Speaker 3>There's too many of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a lot of benefit in that.</v>

1415
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Like for guys like you or for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you and I,</v>

1416
01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:38.670
<v Speaker 3>it's great because there's so many clubs</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can work at,</v>

1417
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much variety as far as like </v>

1418
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:44.230
<v Speaker 3>restaurants we could eat at are places </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go and so much culture to see.</v>

1419
01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:49.590
<v Speaker 3>But also you're dealing with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive volume of people and it's hard </v>

1420
01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:54.181
<v Speaker 3>to keep your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to keep your perspective just </v>

1421
01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.911
<v Speaker 3>with the sheer numbers and I think in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways it mirrors what we're </v>

1422
01:00:56.911 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 3>talking about with even with celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 3>or fame or with wealth that it's hard to</v>

1423
01:00:59.951 --> 01:01:01.810
<v Speaker 3>keep perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for people,</v>

1424
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:06.490
<v Speaker 3>people need adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult situations that we need things</v>

1425
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.050
<v Speaker 3>in order to keep our perspective.</v>

1426
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.470
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you been to Tokyo?</v>

1427
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Tokyo is liked hectic.</v>

1428
01:01:15.521 --> 01:01:17.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not as many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as much of a car culture,</v>

1429
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 2>but there's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what part of it's cultural,</v>

1430
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.070
<v Speaker 2>whether cars play it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1431
01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Everything is times square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

1432
01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big time square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like this concept of space </v>

1433
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.850
<v Speaker 2>and it's not like when I go to New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fuck you,</v>

1434
01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:31.660
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

1435
01:01:31.661 --> 01:01:36.661
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like you're just like in a rat </v>

1436
01:01:36.661 --> 01:01:38.431
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in Tokyo there was this weird </v>

1437
01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>harmonic sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like choreographed,</v>

1438
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>so less of a like I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1439
01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Less aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More respect.</v>

1440
01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's.</v>

1441
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is that cultural thing we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about earlier,</v>

1442
01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's less of like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's maybe it's because we live in</v>

1443
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 2>a capitalist society where it's all like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're competing with everybody too,</v>

1444
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>but they compete in a very different way</v>
<v Speaker 2>than we do</v>

1445
01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:01.790
<v Speaker 3>compete with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a lot of honor and behavior </v>

1446
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:05.010
<v Speaker 3>patterns and this is expected to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different world,</v>

1447
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:07.560
<v Speaker 3>but I was amazed how polite people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Tokyo.</v>

1448
01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I was just literally,</v>

1449
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I accidentally was rude so many </v>

1450
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.260
<v Speaker 2>because when a cab picks you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to open the door.</v>

1451
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:19.130
<v Speaker 2>The door opens and it's considered rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you open the door yourself,</v>

1452
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.700
<v Speaker 2>close at</v>

1453
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>driver gets up and opens and closes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

1454
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's rude to do something for </v>

1455
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:28.300
<v Speaker 1>yourself and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because I just,</v>

1456
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel like you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be robbed because everyone's like,</v>

1457
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>how can I help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the service is like,</v>

1458
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

1459
01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it's all about honor and dignity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pride in your work,</v>

1460
01:02:36.781 --> 01:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>which were all about fucking shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1461
01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>how do I know all about doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most difficult way,</v>

1462
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>like doing or the most painstaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains.</v>

1463
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Like Samurais there was never seen an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual Samurai sword.</v>

1464
01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Now of course Joe's got one in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>

1465
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheeses from the 15 hundreds.</v>

1466
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Real Samurai sword from the 15 </v>

1467
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like legitimately.</v>

1468
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at that blade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blade was made by some guy,</v>

1469
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.880
<v Speaker 1>so turned on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steel pounded it,</v>

1470
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 1>folded it over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounded it again,</v>

1471
01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:16.560
<v Speaker 1>folded it over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounded again.</v>

1472
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:21.770
<v Speaker 1>It takes for ever for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see if you look at the actual </v>

1473
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>emily line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1474
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so much more humanizing.</v>

1475
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like if there's just an assembly </v>
<v Speaker 1>line that's making these,</v>

1476
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human,</v>

1477
01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:33.621
<v Speaker 1>you just feel like a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you are robbed of your </v>

1478
01:03:33.621 --> 01:03:33.621
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1479
01:03:33.621 --> 01:03:33.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1480
01:03:33.621 --> 01:03:37.590
<v Speaker 1>you can take pride in your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did a different than anybody.</v>

1481
01:03:37.591 --> 01:03:39.960
<v Speaker 1>They did it different than anybody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>making swords.</v>

1482
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had sword making and sort of get </v>

1483
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>your core feel on point for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real deal.</v>

1484
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Is this to actually kill people or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this the Samurai fight?</v>

1485
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Probably killed people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it feels like to stab </v>

1486
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.290
<v Speaker 1>someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's not easy.</v>

1487
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

1488
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way stronger than me.</v>

1489
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.610
<v Speaker 1>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

1490
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>what's the stomach?</v>

1491
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It's probably pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to create a replica of what it </v>

1492
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>would be like to stab someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be like watermelon?</v>

1493
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kill a deer.</v>

1494
01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get like an animal that's not obvious,</v>

1495
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 1>but like ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ribs stop it.</v>

1496
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>No ribs can if you're weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1497
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But it depends on how heavy the blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1498
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Like does anyone ever tried to stab </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone?</v>

1499
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ribs just stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing from for sure,</v>

1500
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>because that's what ribs are for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To protect your.</v>

1501
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a weak person who stabs you in </v>

1502
01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>the wrong spot with a small knife is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not going to get it in,</v>

1503
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.350
<v Speaker 1>but somebody who stabs you with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing,</v>

1504
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>the odds of that not going through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ribs,</v>

1505
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a strong person,</v>

1506
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're going to penetrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire body,</v>

1507
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's also mirrored in archery </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting.</v>

1508
01:04:52.531 --> 01:04:57.531
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of bowhunting is to have a </v>

1509
01:04:57.531 --> 01:04:59.070
<v Speaker 1>heavier Arrow that has a sharp blade </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a powerful bow.</v>

1510
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>So it goes through bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it goes through the ribs,</v>

1511
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>doesn't go through the rows of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops at the ribs.</v>

1512
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Then you just have a wounded animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you on bone marrow?</v>

1513
01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1514
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.510
<v Speaker 1>My nails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hair,</v>

1515
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>like it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that same book,</v>

1516
01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>it talks about how bone marrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1517
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1518
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 5>exponentially went up when humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>started eating the bone marrow of animal</v>

1519
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 5>because they couldn't have their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

1520
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:26.950
<v Speaker 5>They had to eat the leftover bone trash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1521
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.160
<v Speaker 5>But that's actually where all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>vitamins negotiating with.</v>

1522
01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 5>There's so many questions and so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>theories about what caused the doubling </v>

1523
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.281
<v Speaker 5>of the human brain size over a period of</v>
<v Speaker 5>2 million years is really a fascinating </v>

1524
01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 5>subject because they just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all this speculation.</v>

1525
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Speaker 5>There's something that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1526
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:49.440
<v Speaker 5>the ability to throw the throwing arm </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's one of the most unique </v>

1527
01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.461
<v Speaker 5>aspects of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no other animal that can take a </v>

1528
01:05:53.461 --> 01:05:55.660
<v Speaker 5>rock and throw it with accuracy like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person can.</v>

1529
01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:58.840
<v Speaker 5>So like ground nesting birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things along those lines.</v>

1530
01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:03.841
<v Speaker 5>That hand eye coordination and like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzee can throw something but </v>

1531
01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:03.841
<v Speaker 5>doesn't mean it's going to hit the </v>
<v Speaker 5>target.</v>

1532
01:06:03.841 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have the synapses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have the connections and it's</v>

1533
01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 5>mine that allow it to be like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>accurate at distance.</v>

1534
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.480
<v Speaker 5>Like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like think about like a pitcher who </v>

1535
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 5>could throw a fastball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many feet is it to plate?</v>

1536
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:19.830
<v Speaker 5>Sixty to 62 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's also,</v>

1537
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 5>we were evolved to see underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1538
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 5>Like fish as first started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're actually,</v>

1539
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.570
<v Speaker 5>our vision is I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if you ever read the theory,</v>

1540
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:33.130
<v Speaker 5>so please,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever read the aquatic ape theory.</v>

1541
01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:38.131
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The aquatic ape theory is really </v>

1542
01:06:38.131 --> 01:06:38.710
<v Speaker 5>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very controversial,</v>

1543
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:43.711
<v Speaker 5>but the idea is that human beings come </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the womb with so much body fat </v>

1544
01:06:43.711 --> 01:06:44.800
<v Speaker 5>and we're so different than chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 5>in that regard.</v>

1545
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Like a chimpanzee baby is like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzee adult.</v>

1546
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 5>It's just little ds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a human babies filled with fat super</v>

1547
01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most species are born ready to go.</v>

1548
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Ours are born completely helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just helpless,</v>

1549
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:02.971
<v Speaker 5>but fat like covered in fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea is that we were in water </v>

1550
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:08.010
<v Speaker 5>and that we developed and we possibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved around water to the point where </v>

1551
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.160
<v Speaker 5>babies like if you throw a chimpanzee </v>
<v Speaker 5>baby in the water,</v>

1552
01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.000
<v Speaker 5>they fucking drown.</v>

1553
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.430
<v Speaker 5>They just the day breathe water and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>drown.</v>

1554
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:20.550
<v Speaker 5>You throw a human baby in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The instinctively hold their breath </v>

1555
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:20.920
<v Speaker 5>because they're basically fish until </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're born.</v>

1556
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Like the Nirvana cover with the baby in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the water.</v>

1557
01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:29.940
<v Speaker 5>Like when my kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my kids learned how to swim when they </v>

1559
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.101
<v Speaker 5>were babies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we taught them when they were really </v>

1560
01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:32.101
<v Speaker 5>little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got them instruction.</v>

1561
01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:33.580
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things you realize like </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1562
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:37.550
<v Speaker 5>it's a very natural thing to hold your </v>
<v Speaker 5>breath and go on to walk.</v>

1563
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's totally instinctive.</v>

1564
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.180
<v Speaker 5>And so the aquatic eight theory </v>
<v Speaker 5>theorized is that at one point in our </v>

1565
01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:49.201
<v Speaker 5>evolution we were primarily water bound </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that may be we went into the water </v>

1566
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:54.421
<v Speaker 5>to get away from predators or that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>we figured out a way to develop in the </v>

1567
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:58.411
<v Speaker 5>water as lower hominids do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so no other animal holds their breath </v>

1568
01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:01.690
<v Speaker 5>either though about no other animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that other primates don't.</v>

1569
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 5>Other primates just fucking drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Webbed at some point is,</v>

1570
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:08.090
<v Speaker 5>is that for swimming?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't we have web?</v>

1571
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.810
<v Speaker 5>That's true because chimps don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true.</v>

1572
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.480
<v Speaker 5>We might have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we certainly don't.</v>

1573
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Some go wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every now and then have webbed feet,</v>

1574
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but that could be just an aberration </v>
<v Speaker 1>lip,</v>

1575
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.010
<v Speaker 1>cleft palate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1576
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you'd have a web.</v>

1577
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it makes sense.</v>

1578
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's a controversial thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind help you swim.</v>

1579
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't get in the way.</v>

1580
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to like do shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>

1581
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean they weren't texting,</v>

1582
01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way from your instagraming lot of </v>

1583
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>things is climb trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1584
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Like stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well making tools.</v>

1585
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it maybe we'd get in the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your fingers less agile but not </v>

1586
01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>webbed hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be helpful if he would help?</v>

1587
01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Because our toes can't do anything or </v>
<v Speaker 1>toes are useless for swimming flipper,</v>

1588
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about our fingers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1589
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:08.801
<v Speaker 1>If you think about like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dexterity and the control that we </v>

1590
01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:11.831
<v Speaker 1>have over our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so unusual in comparison to any </v>

1591
01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:15.401
<v Speaker 1>other animal and our fingers that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>our fingers get all wet and what does </v>

1592
01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 1>that wrinkly.</v>

1593
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:24.850
<v Speaker 1>There was this interesting study about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how fingers after being in water for two</v>

1594
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:28.940
<v Speaker 1>hours could pick up more marbles then </v>
<v Speaker 1>dry hands.</v>

1595
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which kind of means that we must have </v>

1596
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:36.880
<v Speaker 1>needed to be in the water a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that what it means or is it just a </v>

1597
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 1>side effect of just your fingers getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrinkly?</v>

1598
01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would they get wrinkly if it </v>

1599
01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 1>wasn't useful for something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that just why?</v>

1600
01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Why do people get cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me started on turnover.</v>

1601
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 1>That is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a benefit to that?</v>

1602
01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 1>How many things are a benefit of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not designed to live past like 30,</v>

1603
01:09:56.211 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we definitely didn't live past 30 a</v>

1604
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very often.</v>

1605
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.020
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1606
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1607
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a Klutz seat like I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking just like slapped his </v>

1608
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>

1609
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Just didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientist think they've answered with </v>

1610
01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:17.650
<v Speaker 1>the skin on human fingers and toes </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrivels up like an old proven.</v>

1611
01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 1>When we soak in the bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laboratory tests confirmed that theory,</v>

1612
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:23.831
<v Speaker 1>that wrinkly fingers improve our grip on</v>
<v Speaker 1>wet or submerged objects working to </v>

1613
01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:27.650
<v Speaker 1>channel away the water like a rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>treads and car tires.</v>

1614
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You know why it makes sense because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of your skin doesn't do that.</v>

1615
01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Like if your elbow got all wrinkly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1616
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So a evolutionary neurobiologist and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues just that wrinkling being an </v>

1617
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>active process must have an evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

1618
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.320
<v Speaker 1>The team also showed the pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrinkling appeared to be optimized for </v>

1619
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.801
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Providing a drainage network that </v>

1620
01:10:50.801 --> 01:10:52.841
<v Speaker 1>improved grip makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we were trying to get fish or </v>

1621
01:10:52.841 --> 01:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>some shit rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1622
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it totally makes sense.</v>

1623
01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.350
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

1624
01:10:57.351 --> 01:11:02.351
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen when you sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it know mostly really just fuckers.</v>

1625
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've talked about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1626
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I think activity is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think exercise is good and I think,</v>

1627
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people,</v>

1628
01:11:13.381 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are</v>

1629
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:19.070
<v Speaker 5>very fit and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think that like a lot of things </v>

1630
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 5>when you take certain aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 5>physical activity,</v>

1631
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:28.071
<v Speaker 5>like Steve Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a good friend of mine and he's a </v>

1632
01:11:28.071 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 5>strength and conditioning coach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said it best that physical fitness,</v>

1633
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:36.470
<v Speaker 5>like I'm lifting weights and engaging in</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise activities he doesn't believe </v>

1634
01:11:38.101 --> 01:11:43.101
<v Speaker 5>is a sport in unto itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thinks it's good at getting you </v>

1635
01:11:43.101 --> 01:11:47.100
<v Speaker 5>strong for other sports.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when you turn into a sport like who </v>

1636
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.690
<v Speaker 5>can do the most clean and presses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who could do the most,</v>

1637
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1638
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dead lifts in an hour,</v>

1639
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.680
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't think that that's healthy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because in this is he's far more </v>

1640
01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.300
<v Speaker 5>qualified than I am to answer this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm using his rationale.</v>

1641
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.480
<v Speaker 5>He thinks that power lifting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodybuilding movement or powerlifting </v>

1642
01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.920
<v Speaker 5>and weightlifting movements like dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifts or like cleans and presses,</v>

1643
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.590
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't do them for like sets of </v>
<v Speaker 5>30 and 40 and 50,</v>

1644
01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 5>and having these competition to see who </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do the most.</v>

1645
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not beneficial.</v>

1646
01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:23.090
<v Speaker 5>It's not he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's of the school of thought that you </v>

1647
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:26.301
<v Speaker 5>should like strength lifting exercises </v>
<v Speaker 5>are strength producing exercises.</v>

1648
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Should it be done with a low repetitions</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1649
01:12:30.451 --> 01:12:35.451
<v Speaker 5>you should take breaks in between them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's about building the physical </v>

1650
01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:39.081
<v Speaker 5>strength of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not about performing them in a </v>

1651
01:12:39.081 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 5>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the crossfit people,</v>

1652
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I think if I could speak for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they think of it as a healthy </v>

1653
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:49.101
<v Speaker 5>lifestyle and that this competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes them work harder and they all </v>

1654
01:12:49.101 --> 01:12:50.970
<v Speaker 5>work out together and I definitely see </v>
<v Speaker 5>their point.</v>

1655
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 5>And if you follow crossfit people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ms.one</v>

1656
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:59.211
<v Speaker 5>of the things about crossfit people that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say like if someone's a crossfit </v>

1657
01:12:59.211 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 5>and they're a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do they talk about first?</v>

1658
01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen that?</v>

1659
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.830
<v Speaker 5>Because it's like a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was on like a,</v>

1660
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 5>it was like a chalk board that was in </v>
<v Speaker 5>front of a coffee shop.</v>

1661
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's,</v>

1662
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.580
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things we get excited </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it like vegans the most </v>

1663
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.811
<v Speaker 5>proselytizing vegans and you'd talk to </v>
<v Speaker 5>them like one of the things I've found </v>

1664
01:13:20.811 --> 01:13:21.330
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of vegans get really upset</v>
<v Speaker 5>with me because I eat meat,</v>

1665
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:26.570
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of them is that I'll go to </v>

1666
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.570
<v Speaker 5>their instagram page after the shit on </v>
<v Speaker 5>me and I say,</v>

1667
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:29.580
<v Speaker 5>I just found a bacon fucking sandwich </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's four months old.</v>

1668
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:31.020
<v Speaker 5>So it means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long have you been a Vegan?</v>

1669
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 5>I've been Vegan for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's three months.</v>

1670
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:38.631
<v Speaker 5>It's opened my eyes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found my favorite person online the </v>

1671
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:38.631
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a Vegan.</v>

1672
01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Who believes the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a flat rate to eat.</v>

1673
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>

1674
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:45.510
<v Speaker 5>The flat earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flat earth people.</v>

1675
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.590
<v Speaker 5>There is a lot of people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 5>believes the fucking earth is flat.</v>

1676
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.920
<v Speaker 5>They believe that it's all a hoax and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then NASA is a hoax and that satellites </v>

1677
01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.611
<v Speaker 5>aren't real and that there is airplanes </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are flying high and that's where </v>

1678
01:13:58.611 --> 01:14:00.360
<v Speaker 5>we're getting like direct tv from and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's all a giant,</v>

1679
01:14:00.361 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 5>vast conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And here's my favorite part.</v>

1680
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Gravity's not real and that the earth </v>
<v Speaker 5>exists.</v>

1681
01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:10.551
<v Speaker 5>The reason why we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're staying put because </v>

1682
01:14:10.551 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 5>electromagnetism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

1683
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even going to.</v>

1684
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know how to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1685
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Just just be headings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of how many astronomers and these </v>

1686
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:26.851
<v Speaker 4>are the people having kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are just procreating all </v>

1687
01:14:26.851 --> 01:14:30.691
<v Speaker 4>day with other people that they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people were in on it and they </v>

1688
01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 4>think that if you look at the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's,</v>

1689
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 4>there's videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a video that shows like the</v>

1690
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:38.791
<v Speaker 4>200 reasons why they can prove that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth is flat and it's so fucking </v>

1691
01:14:38.791 --> 01:14:39.410
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hurts my feelings.</v>

1692
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1693
01:14:40.131 --> 01:14:41.110
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me.</v>

1694
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:44.470
<v Speaker 4>So maybe it's my mind nightwatch or </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight or flight thing,</v>

1695
01:14:44.471 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 4>but like when I hear that I just feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm in danger.</v>

1696
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:53.130
<v Speaker 4>But you are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like a stupid people make me </v>

1697
01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 4>feel unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it is is there's a lot of religions</v>

1698
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:58.590
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Religion actually serves a.</v>

1699
01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.940
<v Speaker 4>I understand the neurological purpose it</v>
<v Speaker 4>serves.</v>

1700
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1701
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.310
<v Speaker 4>don't be.</v>

1702
01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:08.100
<v Speaker 5>What else can I say is there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>religions.</v>

1703
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:11.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean the word religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just ditch it.</v>

1704
01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:13.470
<v Speaker 5>Let's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the,</v>

1705
01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:18.680
<v Speaker 5>what's the mental pathway that one's one</v>
<v Speaker 5>follows when they adhere to an ideology.</v>

1706
01:15:19.531 --> 01:15:21.330
<v Speaker 5>And I think we're all guilty of it to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain extent.</v>

1707
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:21.870
<v Speaker 5>We all have them.</v>

1708
01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Speaker 4>We need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there needs to be something </v>

1709
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:29.851
<v Speaker 4>in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like don't kill people like guilt </v>

1710
01:15:29.851 --> 01:15:31.210
<v Speaker 4>and shame used to keep societies </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled and have a sense of order.</v>

1711
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guns and before prisons and before shit </v>

1712
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:36.970
<v Speaker 4>was organized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like God's going to get.</v>

1713
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 4>You had to come up with something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep people from raping each other and </v>

1714
01:15:42.041 --> 01:15:42.850
<v Speaker 4>murdering everyone.</v>

1715
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:45.070
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at least stopping it.</v>

1716
01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Don't do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1717
01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1718
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

1719
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:52.831
<v Speaker 5>let's nip this shit in the bud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's figure out what the business </v>

1720
01:15:52.831 --> 01:15:52.831
<v Speaker 5>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

1721
01:15:52.831 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can charge for this.</v>

1722
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.060
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1723
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1724
01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's countless examples of people </v>

1725
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:04.051
<v Speaker 5>creating these behavior patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 5>other folks are forced to follow and </v>

1726
01:16:04.051 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 5>these ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will.</v>

1727
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.690
<v Speaker 5>You see the way people think and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a certain extent,</v>

1728
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.680
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of like really what w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what people called the regressive left.</v>

1729
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 5>Like when people get mad at a white guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>for wearing dreadlocks and they say this</v>

1730
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:20.950
<v Speaker 5>is cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You taking black people's culture.</v>

1731
01:16:21.130 --> 01:16:26.130
<v Speaker 5>Like that sort of same thing is a kin to</v>
<v Speaker 5>religious people that want to force </v>

1732
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:31.870
<v Speaker 5>women to dress a certain way or want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>force gay people to act a certain way.</v>

1733
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:37.300
<v Speaker 5>There's there's parts of certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideologies that literally exists because</v>

1734
01:16:37.721 --> 01:16:42.721
<v Speaker 5>someone is trying to exert control over </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people and they think they can </v>

1735
01:16:42.721 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 5>because it's a rule too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try it like the like the other.</v>

1736
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:51.030
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad example that I used about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dreadlocks because it's so fucking </v>

1737
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.310
<v Speaker 5>stupid because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vikings wear dreadlocks.</v>

1738
01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:56.311
<v Speaker 5>The Greeks had dread locks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a white thing to a dirty hair </v>

1739
01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:56.311
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1740
01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:56.850
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a scale.</v>

1741
01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 5>Only had dreadlocks until it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid,</v>

1742
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 5>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a new way that people can get upset</v>

1743
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 5>at certain groups and the left like </v>
<v Speaker 5>especially like what people.</v>

1744
01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of people get upset with that</v>
<v Speaker 5>term.</v>

1745
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 3>The regressive left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good term and the reason why </v>

1746
01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a good terms because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1747
01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:19.151
<v Speaker 3>they're attacking straight there all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're attacking white gay men now for </v>

1748
01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:23.201
<v Speaker 3>having privileges that I've wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole article about white gay privilege </v>

1749
01:17:23.201 --> 01:17:26.090
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to black men and people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>color who are gay,</v>

1750
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.240
<v Speaker 3>who don't get to experience the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom that white gay people do that </v>

1751
01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 3>live in white neighborhoods and have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1752
01:17:33.621 --> 01:17:35.420
<v Speaker 3>adopt white babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for them.</v>

1753
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's attacking it,</v>

1754
01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:39.040
<v Speaker 3>this constant,</v>

1755
01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:40.620
<v Speaker 2>but we love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was you.</v>

1756
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.460
<v Speaker 2>We were texting about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love being outrageous and I don't</v>

1757
01:17:44.461 --> 01:17:49.461
<v Speaker 2>know what the creational outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love complaint and I think it is a </v>

1758
01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:52.491
<v Speaker 2>form of bonding and I think it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>helped people connect to each other and </v>

1759
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:52.491
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1760
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>organize and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love being offended.</v>

1761
01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:56.040
<v Speaker 2>They love being insulted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love,</v>

1762
01:17:56.250 --> 01:18:01.250
<v Speaker 2>they love racism because then they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to complain about it and began to take </v>

1763
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:04.761
<v Speaker 2>the moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to be sanctimonious and they get to </v>

1764
01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:04.761
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1765
01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:04.761
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

1766
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that sort of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to call it religion because</v>

1767
01:18:08.371 --> 01:18:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a pattern and patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideologies.</v>

1768
01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it's problematic when you label </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like this is because of God,</v>

1769
01:18:14.641 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's these,</v>

1770
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:17.660
<v Speaker 3>these patterns that people force their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind into,</v>

1771
01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.880
<v Speaker 3>well some people force themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>these patterns where everything is a </v>

1772
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.811
<v Speaker 3>fucking conspiracy and that this is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to this like delusional state of</v>

1773
01:18:27.451 --> 01:18:31.480
<v Speaker 3>mind that would allow you to think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth is flat or that,</v>

1774
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government's run by Reptilians.</v>

1775
01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:38.170
<v Speaker 2>But to me intelligence is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone being able to go,</v>

1776
01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I think this is how it is or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not being married to your idea.</v>

1777
01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Just like I could totally be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1778
01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is this?</v>

1780
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Like all my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my self esteem and identity is </v>

1781
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:58.050
<v Speaker 2>linked to this lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how sad and lonely is that </v>

1782
01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:01.690
<v Speaker 2>person that they need to attach to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that it's just,</v>

1783
01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:06.691
<v Speaker 2>it's just so odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think comedians are brains are </v>

1784
01:19:06.691 --> 01:19:09.391
<v Speaker 2>a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like we can go through our set and </v>

1785
01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:12.040
<v Speaker 2>say argue a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue against our own point,</v>

1786
01:19:12.041 --> 01:19:17.041
<v Speaker 2>go back on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then someone had called and it's </v>

1787
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:17.041
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a good point.</v>

1788
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:17.041
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1789
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel very lucky that we have brains </v>

1790
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:20.130
<v Speaker 2>that are able to see everybody's side </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

1791
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.770
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what we do for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very shocking to me.</v>

1792
01:19:23.771 --> 01:19:28.771
<v Speaker 2>It seems so suffocating and isolating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and weird to just be stuck on one thing.</v>

1793
01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to be.</v>

1794
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:38.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obviously easy to them is their </v>

1795
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.830
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1796
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And if you think something and someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>proves you wrong,</v>

1797
01:19:41.471 --> 01:19:46.471
<v Speaker 3>you will be angry and you will defend </v>
<v Speaker 3>that original idea as if it's a part of </v>

1798
01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:46.471
<v Speaker 3>someone's trying to steal.</v>

1799
01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:47.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you insulting me?</v>

1800
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I take from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1801
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People react to it.</v>

1802
01:19:51.201 --> 01:19:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Like stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so intense.</v>

1803
01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:55.290
<v Speaker 3>That's when you can see right away that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an issue.</v>

1804
01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people take it very personally.</v>

1805
01:19:57.331 --> 01:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>If you don't share that belief</v>

1806
01:20:00.490 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 2>are the ones that detached from their </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief systems the fastest,</v>

1807
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:05.750
<v Speaker 2>like doctors and scientists like mirror </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons.</v>

1808
01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 2>It was all about mirror neurons like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago.</v>

1809
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1810
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And then they recently just debunk that </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and scientists.</v>

1811
01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>

1812
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:12.920
<v Speaker 1>we were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what science is all.</v>

1814
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:16.350
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't mind who's a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1815
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 1>because he's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1816
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm at my practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1817
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:20.520
<v Speaker 1>do you guys feel like it's weird that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you call it practice,</v>

1818
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:22.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to call it good at,</v>

1819
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:28.070
<v Speaker 1>nailed it or the game time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at my game time championship game.</v>

1820
01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1821
01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:34.671
<v Speaker 1>it's called practice because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine is doing the best we can with </v>

1822
01:20:34.671 --> 01:20:34.671
<v Speaker 1>what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of we don't know.</v>

1823
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 10 years we're going to be doing </v>

1824
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.070
<v Speaker 1>looking back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

1825
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you fucking did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was dangerous.</v>

1826
01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:45.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like what medicine and sciences </v>

1827
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:48.021
<v Speaker 1>like you're wrong every five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new fucking piece of </v>

1828
01:20:48.021 --> 01:20:48.021
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

1829
01:20:48.021 --> 01:20:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the latest thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted yesterday that they've given </v>

1830
01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.221
<v Speaker 1>approval to people?</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is like comedy central site,</v>

1866
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.620
<v Speaker 1>proven scientific concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

1867
01:22:28.621 --> 01:22:33.621
<v Speaker 1>Exploring the potential of cutting edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>biomedical technology for human neuro </v>

1868
01:22:33.621 --> 01:22:35.790
<v Speaker 1>regeneration and how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

1869
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.320
<v Speaker 1>how much is a consummation neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>reanimation is.</v>

1870
01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So when you see reanimator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of that fucking movie reanimator</v>

1871
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.500
<v Speaker 1>movie where they brought the monsters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that brought the people back to life </v>

1872
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.351
<v Speaker 1>when they were monsters movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reanimator like some mad scientist </v>

1873
01:22:51.351 --> 01:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1874
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Is it exciting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a private thing?</v>

1875
01:22:55.441 --> 01:22:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to reanimated one invest.</v>

1876
01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
<v Speaker 1>that's all you're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you probably have some </v>

1878
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.000
<v Speaker 1>fighter Fred's who could use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1879
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both have a couple of my</v>

1880
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:08.650
<v Speaker 5>fucking inject some shit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fixing.</v>

1881
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:11.320
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian has never been hit.</v>

1882
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't even have any real excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1883
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:17.911
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure his wife said I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he likes to box lately.</v>

1884
01:23:18.281 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 5>Brian's into boxing and I think he is </v>
<v Speaker 5>way worse for you,</v>

1885
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1886
01:23:21.911 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 5>it's all bad for you in fucking soccer </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives you brain damage.</v>

1887
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.080
<v Speaker 5>Your head's not to get as opposed to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>jostled around too much,</v>

1888
01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:33.450
<v Speaker 5>but goes every direction except it goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>right except down.</v>

1889
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 5>I have a buddy of mine who's a professor</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's 49 or 50 and he kicked boxes.</v>

1890
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:41.140
<v Speaker 5>He's bars and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1891
01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.720
<v Speaker 5>you understand this like you're into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1892
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a history professor.</v>

1893
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 5>Like you understand that this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous for your brand,</v>

1894
01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:53.521
<v Speaker 5>but you get so much enjoyment out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>thrill of being primal actually been in </v>

1895
01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:54.190
<v Speaker 5>their sparring.</v>

1896
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we,</v>

1897
01:23:56.821 --> 01:24:01.821
<v Speaker 2>we didn't talk about this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that calcium storico thing in Italy once</v>

1898
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:05.420
<v Speaker 2>they bare knuckle football with bare </v>
<v Speaker 2>knuckle boxing.</v>

1899
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

1900
01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So I was going to go to about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

1901
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Pete Berg I think ended up making it</v>

1902
01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:17.471
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were like just broken up and I'm </v>

1903
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:17.471
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I making a documentary with my ex</v>

1904
01:24:17.471 --> 01:24:19.370
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really self abusive,</v>

1905
01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:23.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the month that it happens,</v>

1906
01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.240
<v Speaker 2>violence in the area goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1907
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something interesting about </v>

1908
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:32.801
<v Speaker 2>these guys who want to go spar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they're sexually harassing </v>

1909
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:35.480
<v Speaker 2>less women at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're having less bar fights.</v>

1910
01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.540
<v Speaker 2>This calcium storico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to</v>

1911
01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:43.541
<v Speaker 2>entertain kings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was stopped because so many people </v>

1912
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:44.170
<v Speaker 2>were dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I want to say 1916,</v>

1913
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.400
<v Speaker 2>they brought it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep it low profile because so many</v>

1914
01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:50.100
<v Speaker 2>people get concussions in sick group </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

1915
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>two on one.</v>

1916
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:58.020
<v Speaker 2>These are grown men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are not young like athletes.</v>

1917
01:24:58.021 --> 01:25:00.210
<v Speaker 2>They're not professional athletes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>butchers,</v>

1918
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:00.920
<v Speaker 2>they're lawyers.</v>

1919
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:06.110
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exchange partners like guys just moved </v>

1920
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.180
<v Speaker 5>and a new guy moved in and they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>touched hands.</v>

1921
01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 5>Like one guy was duking it out with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy and then for some reason they </v>

1922
01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 5>changed it.</v>

1923
01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Bare knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1924
01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:16.530
<v Speaker 2>it's also by by region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like neighborhoods against </v>

1925
01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:20.551
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of it's like fathers against </v>

1926
01:25:20.551 --> 01:25:20.551
<v Speaker 2>sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers against brothers,</v>

1927
01:25:20.551 --> 01:25:23.690
<v Speaker 5>the change teammates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like two guys were fighting and then </v>

1928
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.570
<v Speaker 5>another guy steps in and takes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

1929
01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:26.670
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys have dogs,</v>

1930
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:26.900
<v Speaker 5>good</v>

1931
01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.390
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's no,</v>

1932
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:32.840
<v Speaker 2>these are not a guy just stepped in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These professional athletes,</v>

1933
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:36.500
<v Speaker 2>these are literally guys that have other</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs once a year.</v>

1934
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:40.700
<v Speaker 2>They just agree to fucking just gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty far.</v>

1946
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you said</v>

1947
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.740
<v Speaker 4>score,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people just pummel you and then you see </v>

1948
01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:11.740
<v Speaker 4>these guys in the corners with </v>
<v Speaker 4>stretchers.</v>

1949
01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.310
<v Speaker 4>They just carry people off the field the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire time.</v>

1950
01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 4>So this guy's holding this guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She could grapple to.</v>

1951
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.650
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only rule you can bite,</v>

1952
01:26:18.651 --> 01:26:20.780
<v Speaker 4>you can kick the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do anything.</v>

1953
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 4>The only thing you can do is to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on one,</v>

1954
01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 4>that's the only rule you can bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only rule is no two on one.</v>

1955
01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:29.930
<v Speaker 4>You can kick in the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1956
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe that's like a general.</v>

1957
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:37.020
<v Speaker 1>She is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two guys are the only two guys that are </v>

1958
01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.031
<v Speaker 1>humping were these two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got this guy's back and </v>

1959
01:26:39.031 --> 01:26:41.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people fucking lolly </v>
<v Speaker 1>gagging cherry pickers.</v>

1960
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:45.550
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could they make get out there?</v>

1961
01:26:45.551 --> 01:26:46.840
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

1962
01:26:46.841 --> 01:26:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just knock these guys out one at a time.</v>

1963
01:26:49.811 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1964
01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.080
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1965
01:26:53.081 --> 01:26:55.480
<v Speaker 1>someone got smacked in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes down,</v>

1966
01:26:55.481 --> 01:26:59.640
<v Speaker 1>he's got the ball and went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another guy took his place in.</v>

1967
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Guys just sort of avoiding the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1968
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 1>This ball guy looks gay as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1969
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1970
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.150
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy gets knocked down.</v>

1971
01:27:07.151 --> 01:27:08.590
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he gets knocked down,</v>

1972
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.600
<v Speaker 1>another guy steps in and fights the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was fighting before he got </v>

1973
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 1>knocked down.</v>

1974
01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a bizarre,</v>

1975
01:27:15.701 --> 01:27:20.701
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turns into just like a melee of madness </v>

1976
01:27:20.701 --> 01:27:24.870
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually interesting to watch the </v>

1977
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:25.030
<v Speaker 4>clusters happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the energy going into one place.</v>

1978
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Only one black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1979
01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1980
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.470
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so boring.</v>

1981
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these guys,</v>

1982
01:27:38.121 --> 01:27:39.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not professional professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

1983
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:41.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like they trained for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

1984
01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that thing the iron man?</v>

1985
01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:46.360
<v Speaker 4>It's like a voluntary thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1986
01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:47.950
<v Speaker 4>It's tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do it,</v>

1987
01:27:47.951 --> 01:27:49.750
<v Speaker 4>if your dad did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1988
01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So stupid.</v>

1989
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:54.580
<v Speaker 4>And so rediculus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1990
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.340
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of tradition in ed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>see everyone wears like joker uniform.</v>

1991
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that guys that are humping </v>

1992
01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:04.360
<v Speaker 1>this still is bothered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1993
01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you guys got this guys back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not doing anything by the way.</v>

1994
01:28:06.671 --> 01:28:11.671
<v Speaker 1>You should go out there when you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary where all the black people,</v>

1995
01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.230
<v Speaker 1>this guy's fucking gay to more buckeyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting happy now.</v>

1996
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:20.740
<v Speaker 1>They just took them off the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another like maybe just a Sicilian.</v>

1997
01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:23.220
<v Speaker 1>This guy's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got dark shit skills.</v>

1998
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like a.</v>

1999
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:28.420
<v Speaker 1>You mean a few of these guys are pulling</v>
<v Speaker 1>people off going on.</v>

2000
01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.750
<v Speaker 4>See the yellow guys in yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when people get fucked up.</v>

2001
01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just get taken off the field and </v>

2002
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.010
<v Speaker 4>then they have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 2:20</v>

2003
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:41.251
<v Speaker 4>minute quarters and then the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the winters have to play again the next </v>

2004
01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:45.720
<v Speaker 4>day again that three days in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the championship is four days later and </v>

2005
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.390
<v Speaker 4>the winning team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their prize is a cow.</v>

2006
01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.220
<v Speaker 4>The Cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a cow,</v>

2007
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.690
<v Speaker 4>a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get money.</v>

2008
01:28:52.691 --> 01:28:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You don't get endorsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing I like about it,</v>

2009
01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.130
<v Speaker 4>that attracted me to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no endorsement deals.</v>

2010
01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.130
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's been promoted.</v>

2011
01:29:00.131 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 4>It's just people that want to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight each other.</v>

2012
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:05.620
<v Speaker 3>What our stand is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the leg kicks?</v>

2013
01:29:05.621 --> 01:29:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys not understand about leg </v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks?</v>

2014
01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.640
<v Speaker 3>Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2015
01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:11.320
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few kicks being thrown,</v>

2016
01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 3>but Noah's Tony Lake kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're standing right in front of each </v>

2017
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:16.440
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no take downs.</v>

2018
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>So there's no takedown tabs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just shitty boxing would the </v>

2019
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 3>occasional kick.</v>

2020
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 4>It's this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically just like a giant street </v>

2021
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2022
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys have a little bit of </v>

2023
01:29:28.150 --> 01:29:28.150
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm looking at the way these.</v>

2024
01:29:28.150 --> 01:29:28.700
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a takedown look at this,</v>

2025
01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 3>but nothing happens so you can take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy down.</v>

2026
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.740
<v Speaker 3>But look at the way these guys are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing in front of each other.</v>

2027
01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Like chicken.</v>

2028
01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.850
<v Speaker 4>I think they probably get out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like are like,</v>

2029
01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:38.050
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

2030
01:29:38.051 --> 01:29:43.051
<v Speaker 4>Let's just like pace around and see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can just get through this 40 minutes </v>

2031
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:43.051
<v Speaker 4>without.</v>

2032
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird because they just exchange</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners.</v>

2033
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:46.410
<v Speaker 3>They move back and forth like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2034
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 3>they square off and then they decide I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to fight you.</v>

2035
01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fight your friend.</v>

2036
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so interesting because think about </v>

2037
01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:55.090
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like these are not trained guys,</v>

2038
01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:55.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's like if you put 20 people </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

2039
01:29:55.761 --> 01:29:58.070
<v Speaker 4>there's no pressure to do it right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2040
01:29:58.071 --> 01:30:00.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like when do you decide it's time </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take you to,</v>

2041
01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>

2042
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.880
<v Speaker 4>this is this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But guy with the ball's going to go </v>

2043
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:07.880
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to get through.</v>

2044
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they're just talking shit like </v>

2045
01:30:12.311 --> 01:30:12.311
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2046
01:30:12.311 --> 01:30:13.330
<v Speaker 3>You look at that kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how do you get.</v>

2047
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.410
<v Speaker 3>Does no one know how to kick?</v>

2048
01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.470
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most people,</v>

2049
01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:17.910
<v Speaker 4>unless they're in Thailand probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

2050
01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 4>I went and saw those fights in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't want to watch those,</v>

2051
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.680
<v Speaker 4>but the point is there's less violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe your friend who is getting </v>

2052
01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.780
<v Speaker 4>brain damage at his gym who has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>business clown.</v>

2053
01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh well Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

2054
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:41.200
<v Speaker 4>if Brian didn't get box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be terrified at the things he </v>

2055
01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.081
<v Speaker 4>was doing in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he needs to be in a gym getting </v>

2056
01:30:45.081 --> 01:30:45.081
<v Speaker 4>punched in the face a couple of hours a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2057
01:30:45.081 --> 01:30:46.810
<v Speaker 4>It's good for the people at crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2058
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:49.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not negative about crossfit,</v>

2059
01:30:49.011 --> 01:30:51.360
<v Speaker 4>but the kind of people who have to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that energy out,</v>

2060
01:30:51.361 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 4>I worry where that energy would go if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't getting it out in competing</v>

2061
01:30:54.901 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 4>or fighting or boxing or whatever.</v>

2062
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.630
<v Speaker 3>That's valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people feel better for sure when</v>

2063
01:30:59.631 --> 01:31:04.631
<v Speaker 3>they have that sort of a release and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think there's a cathartic release and </v>

2064
01:31:04.631 --> 01:31:08.261
<v Speaker 3>any sort of like severe exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think you can get the same </v>

2065
01:31:08.261 --> 01:31:09.470
<v Speaker 3>cathartic release from Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2066
01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not as this really exciting </v>

2067
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:15.040
<v Speaker 3>for a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not as satisfying.</v>

2068
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:15.310
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't give you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This sort of.</v>

2069
01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Channeling doesn't give you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence.</v>

2070
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Like Jujitsu is my favorite because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can go full blast and you get </v>

2071
01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.741
<v Speaker 3>injured for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the same kind of injuries </v>

2072
01:31:26.741 --> 01:31:27.990
<v Speaker 3>that you get usually from like </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing and stuff like kickboxing.</v>

2073
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Sparring to me is the most problematic </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've seen how hard some people </v>

2074
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:37.331
<v Speaker 3>can kick and I just know that if you zig</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you should've zagged and someone </v>

2075
01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:40.070
<v Speaker 3>decides to kick you harder and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Shin bounces off your head.</v>

2076
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know what can be done.</v>

2077
01:31:42.261 --> 01:31:44.660
<v Speaker 3>I've seen too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like when I see that I'm like,</v>

2078
01:31:44.661 --> 01:31:48.680
<v Speaker 3>you are your bms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>BMX jumping with no helmet.</v>

2079
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you're going to anything.</v>

2080
01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:51.590
<v Speaker 4>The Jungle Java.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2081
01:31:51.591 --> 01:31:53.270
<v Speaker 4>it's not about if it's about when.</v>

2082
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well especially kickboxing.</v>

2083
01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing to me is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like even boxing is more.</v>

2084
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:04.260
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're sparring with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who you know are not going to hit you </v>

2085
01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 3>hard least you've got a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>control of this situation.</v>

2086
01:32:06.330 --> 01:32:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really resonate or like was profound </v>

2087
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:14.100
<v Speaker 2>to me when you said that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to fall to know you're not your</v>

2088
01:32:14.101 --> 01:32:15.210
<v Speaker 2>limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2089
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:20.250
<v Speaker 2>don't know how far ramifications you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to understand that when I broke my </v>

2090
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:23.961
<v Speaker 2>shoulder it changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was actually something that </v>

2091
01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.890
<v Speaker 2>needed to happen because I've pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself way too hard.</v>

2092
01:32:25.891 --> 01:32:30.891
<v Speaker 2>I had no respect for my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just routinely abused it with </v>

2093
01:32:30.891 --> 01:32:31.530
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so many ways,</v>

2094
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people I surrounded myself with,</v>

2095
01:32:33.691 --> 01:32:35.130
<v Speaker 2>the things I ate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I lived.</v>

2096
01:32:35.131 --> 01:32:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I didn't sleep and it was like I needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be proven the fragility of my body.</v>

2097
01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vulnerability.</v>

2098
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

2099
01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being able to go,</v>

2100
01:32:43.621 --> 01:32:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2101
01:32:44.251 --> 01:32:49.251
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to try to think like </v>

2102
01:32:49.251 --> 01:32:50.760
<v Speaker 2>more than two hours ahead right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not do that dangerous thing.</v>

2103
01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about your body as if this </v>

2104
01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:56.090
<v Speaker 3>longterm thing and people have given me </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hard time about that too.</v>

2105
01:32:56.091 --> 01:32:58.250
<v Speaker 3>Like go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like especially like lifting weights.</v>

2106
01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I've been wondering why your body is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

2107
01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll put like a video on instagram of me</v>

2108
01:33:02.151 --> 01:33:07.151
<v Speaker 3>working out my trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that the only way you can keep your </v>

2109
01:33:07.151 --> 01:33:08.730
<v Speaker 3>body from getting into sounds so </v>
<v Speaker 3>counterintuitive.</v>

2110
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 3>The only way that you can prevent </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain injuries is by making your body </v>

2111
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.290
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

2112
01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.380
<v Speaker 3>only way you can make your body strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you gotta lift heavy thing.</v>

2113
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any interest or an </v>

2114
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.590
<v Speaker 2>hypermobility?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2115
01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Hypermobile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hypermobile,</v>

2116
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:27.820
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I lift things.</v>

2117
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Everything from a weight to a Coffee Cup</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my joints,</v>

2118
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.290
<v Speaker 2>not my muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was using the term wrong then.</v>

2119
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.610
<v Speaker 2>I know maybe I am too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

2120
01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 2>so western European trash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2121
01:33:38.891 --> 01:33:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I am basically just like alcoholics with</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint problems,</v>

2122
01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:45.520
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of western European genetics </v>
<v Speaker 2>means you're hyper mobile,</v>

2123
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.320
<v Speaker 2>which is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're picking things up,</v>

2124
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 2>putting a lot of strain on your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I pick something up,</v>

2125
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:57.660
<v Speaker 2>it's my knees and my hips and my lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>back instead of my thigh muscles and my </v>

2126
01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:57.850
<v Speaker 2>glue.</v>

2127
01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the best things about </v>

2128
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Kettlebell training in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they're so awkward,</v>

2129
01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:05.410
<v Speaker 3>but it forces you to understand how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use your body as a unit.</v>

2130
01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:10.650
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding type workouts and the </v>

2131
01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:11.650
<v Speaker 3>isolation exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they make your muscles bigger.</v>

2132
01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't allow your body to </v>

2133
01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:17.430
<v Speaker 3>synchronize and use itself as one </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

2134
01:34:17.431 --> 01:34:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.860
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you get non collision </v>

2136
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.531
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you hear about people who are </v>

2137
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:25.531
<v Speaker 2>50 and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sneezed and threw my back out.</v>

2138
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:29.341
<v Speaker 2>That's because they've been putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure on their joints instead of </v>

2139
01:34:29.341 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 2>their muscles for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't have an ass.</v>

2140
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:35.460
<v Speaker 2>Like I never use my glutes just walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and walking upstairs and picking </v>

2141
01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.630
<v Speaker 2>things up and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2142
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and then I had to like relearn how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk and Shit.</v>

2143
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:45.151
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to this fucking police thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like it was so fucking boring.</v>

2144
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.140
<v Speaker 2>This was like three years ago was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking nightmare.</v>

2145
01:34:50.141 --> 01:34:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how to walk.</v>

2146
01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:57.180
<v Speaker 2>You need to relearn how to walk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like sitting in bed.</v>

2147
01:34:57.181 --> 01:34:57.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 6>to you,</v>

2160

<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't know what it's like to be a </v>

2161
01:35:27.881 --> 01:35:28.780
<v Speaker 6>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We believe lies,</v>

2162
01:35:31.050 --> 01:35:33.470
<v Speaker 6>so it's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2163
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 6>the world's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your Dick is huge.</v>

2164
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.840
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of lines going around it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But someone telling you.</v>

2165
01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a writers room once and I was </v>

2166
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.850
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of this story where this,</v>

2167
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:46.320
<v Speaker 1>these characters were going to have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they didn't and I was like,</v>

2168
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an idea.</v>

2169
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:49.830
<v Speaker 1>What if the guy is allergic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spermicide?</v>

2170
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>

2171
01:35:51.331 --> 01:35:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how like some guys are allergic</v>

2172
01:35:53.131 --> 01:35:55.020
<v Speaker 1>to spermicide so they can't use condoms.</v>

2173
01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:01.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like half of the guys I've dated </v>

2174
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.610
<v Speaker 6>guys,</v>

2175
01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't use condoms because there's </v>

2176
01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:07.140
<v Speaker 1>so allergic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

2177
01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:10.770
<v Speaker 1>you are the dumbest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was literally like at,</v>

2178
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:13.060
<v Speaker 1>as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

2179
01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:18.150
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I believe that some women are </v>

2180
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:18.150
<v Speaker 1>allergic to spermicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2181
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:21.600
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard that some women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually allergic to different partners.</v>

2182
01:36:21.601 --> 01:36:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2183
01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please Google sperm fertilizing eggs </v>

2184
01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:34.670
<v Speaker 1>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's really bad reaction to our </v>

2185
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:35.500
<v Speaker 1>cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something frozen eggs are fucking living</v>

2186
01:36:35.501 --> 01:36:39.340
<v Speaker 1>an amazing life in Hermosa beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a great view.</v>

2187
01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It'll a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:36:40.331 --> 01:36:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2189
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:43.840
<v Speaker 1>keep them cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's Cryo freeze.</v>

2190
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I should probably just keep them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the power goes out?</v>

2191
01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I think about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg goes down.</v>

2192
01:36:48.971 --> 01:36:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of the things in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the night that.</v>

2193
01:36:50.531 --> 01:36:55.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they explained to me the generators and </v>

2194
01:36:55.531 --> 01:36:55.531
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

2195
01:36:55.531 --> 01:36:55.531
<v Speaker 1>All I ever think about is when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitals.</v>

2196
01:36:55.531 --> 01:36:59.190
<v Speaker 1>What if the fucking power goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know 33 and how many eggs did you store?</v>

2197
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Where your eggs are still good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.380
<v Speaker 1>they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2199
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>For like another six years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just see an allergy ruined my </v>

2200
01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:08.470
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2201
01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen months after we were married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was diagnosed with humans seminal </v>

2202
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.100
<v Speaker 1>plasma hypersensitivity and allergy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>seaman.</v>

2203
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2204
01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I met Simon at a girlfriend's wedding </v>
<v Speaker 1>name changed to predict identity.</v>

2205
01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:24.250
<v Speaker 1>The faithful day changed my life in more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways than I could've ever imagined.</v>

2206
01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder if she's allergic to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes loads and not everyone's like,</v>

2207
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:34.950
<v Speaker 1>where is it in her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the allergy happening in her vagina </v>

2208
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 1>or in her face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just the that someone's wondering,</v>

2209
01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.660
<v Speaker 1>but I just am curious where like a her </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat itchy.</v>

2210
01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like what allergies guys have.</v>

2211
01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Are some guys allergic to eating pussy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2212
01:37:45.821 --> 01:37:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Sperm analogy sometimes seem analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seminal.</v>

2213
01:37:48.551 --> 01:37:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Plasma hypersensitivity is a rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>allergic reaction to proteins.</v>

2214
01:37:51.671 --> 01:37:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Founded a man's semen mostly affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the vaginal area.</v>

2215
01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

2216
01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Itching and a burning sensation of </v>

2217
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.810
<v Speaker 1>vaginal area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2218
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.810
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2219
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it sounds not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2220
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly affects women.</v>

2221
01:38:04.321 --> 01:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because mostly women catch loads.</v>

2222
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2223
01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the evolutionary purpose of </v>

2224
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2225
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose to every allergy.</v>

2226
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just eliminate people.</v>

2227
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2228
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe evolution doesn't want this woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>to procreate that way.</v>

2229
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It's random mutations and adaptations to</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental changes.</v>

2230
01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It's what if this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2231
01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2232
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:33.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

2233
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't prove beneficial sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2234
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pheromones,</v>

2235
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fairmont smell good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means we should procreate.</v>

2236
01:38:40.071 --> 01:38:45.071
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they smell bad it means we're </v>

2237
01:38:45.071 --> 01:38:45.071
<v Speaker 1>probably related somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when.</v>

2238
01:38:45.071 --> 01:38:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So to have a vagina flare up when sperm </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes in,</v>

2239
01:38:48.511 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 1>it is that nature's way of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman has garbage.</v>

2240
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:56.721
<v Speaker 1>Genetics may be the dude has weak loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if a man has some like fucking </v>

2241
01:38:56.721 --> 01:38:58.950
<v Speaker 1>stout loads get in there and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

2242
01:38:58.951 --> 01:38:59.960
<v Speaker 1>But like I'll tell you this.</v>

2243
01:39:00.010 --> 01:39:01.310
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>

2244
01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just bad loads,</v>

2245
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:07.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's your area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2246
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to not cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Chris Ryan that was explained,</v>

2247
01:39:11.441 --> 01:39:14.920
<v Speaker 1>explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write a book called about loads slow.</v>

2248
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:17.140
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be my new podcast forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Brian.</v>

2249
01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to talk about load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slept three hours twice a week,</v>

2250
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.920
<v Speaker 1>so I'm really interested in loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't have to do my first sexing </v>

2251
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:30.810
<v Speaker 1>actual sex next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let her literally.</v>

2253
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.500
<v Speaker 1>There's so much time and energy has gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

2254
01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Where does his Dick go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does,</v>

2255
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:40.370
<v Speaker 1>where does everything go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When is it for a t shirt?</v>

2256
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be a lot of people in </v>

2257
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.750
<v Speaker 1>the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2258
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll probably minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary people that day.</v>

2259
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:52.851
<v Speaker 1>Like you got a dude who was friends with</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did a sexy with a girl and they're </v>

2260
01:39:53.041 --> 01:39:58.041
<v Speaker 1>making out and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want you could go ahead and fuck </v>

2261
01:39:58.041 --> 01:39:58.041
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2262
01:39:58.041 --> 01:39:58.041
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

2263
01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like the moment you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of girl that says like,</v>

2264
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:07.170
<v Speaker 1>if you could fuck me a b movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even a b movie,</v>

2265
01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:12.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like some no name nonsense </v>

2266
01:40:12.171 --> 01:40:12.171
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>

2267
01:40:12.171 --> 01:40:12.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making out.</v>

2268
01:40:12.171 --> 01:40:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And she just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go ahead and fuck.</v>

2269
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.270
<v Speaker 1>He's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes them to say no more.</v>

2270
01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Return on down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can fuck me,</v>

2271
01:40:18.361 --> 01:40:19.860
<v Speaker 1>please let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2272
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:24.861
<v Speaker 1>I bet he was probably terrified of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to get it up in front of all </v>

2273
01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:24.861
<v Speaker 1>those peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2274
01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:24.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2275
01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:29.691
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were kind of trying to figure </v>

2276
01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:29.691
<v Speaker 1>it out because we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2277
01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:31.830
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be an erection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we just might not be.</v>

2278
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:36.831
<v Speaker 1>You say there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there might not be an erection if </v>

2279
01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:39.351
<v Speaker 1>there's not one job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be crying hysterically that he </v>

2280
01:40:40.831 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 1>will get loud because guys are into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the crying.</v>

2281
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I did an episode with Chris about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2283
01:40:48.381 --> 01:40:53.381
<v Speaker 1>one time he was crying and the guy I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to interaction like red flag you </v>

2284
01:40:55.211 --> 01:41:00.211
<v Speaker 1>like week with sad women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people that have a hard </v>

2285
01:41:00.211 --> 01:41:04.030
<v Speaker 1>time with someone who is not insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're insecure.</v>

2286
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>So if they're insecure and the woman is </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>

2287
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:11.100
<v Speaker 1>they panic and then they could get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have a problem getting an </v>

2288
01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:14.491
<v Speaker 1>erection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the woman like all of a sudden </v>

2289
01:41:14.491 --> 01:41:16.760
<v Speaker 1>needs comforting and she's insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they assume this position.</v>

2290
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2291
01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>So I should be brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secure.</v>

2292
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I will be anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2293
01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is like I was thinking about </v>

2294
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.111
<v Speaker 1>this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two voices that are just </v>

2295
01:41:31.111 --> 01:41:32.980
<v Speaker 1>absolute bullshit that just don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

2296
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.260
<v Speaker 1>we know them as archetypes and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is like,</v>

2297
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:41.610
<v Speaker 1>one of them is like the spooky voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one's scared of this spooky and </v>

2298
01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:45.760
<v Speaker 1>no ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the sexy girl call one 800,</v>

2299
01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:48.400
<v Speaker 1>suck my pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2300
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2301
01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:51.340
<v Speaker 1>please don't ever stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Anyone.</v>

2302
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2303
01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.340
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2304
01:41:57.450 --> 01:42:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey boys doing that doesn't work on </v>

2305
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:05.890
<v Speaker 1>anybody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So men can.</v>

2306
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Men can pretend to be what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know any women who were </v>

2307
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:11.100
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2308
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just seeing those commercials,</v>

2309
01:42:11.621 --> 01:42:15.940
<v Speaker 1>those late night phone call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial call,</v>

2310
01:42:15.941 --> 01:42:20.941
<v Speaker 1>late night commercials at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM or not guys like you that are guys </v>

2311
01:42:20.941 --> 01:42:25.291
<v Speaker 1>who are probably more susceptive who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beta males who need someone even more </v>

2312
01:42:25.291 --> 01:42:28.381
<v Speaker 1>Beta than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's why they have to be </v>

2313
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the naughty girl.</v>

2317
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because they know that the </v>

2318
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:43.801
<v Speaker 1>wife's in the next room and friend.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the politician voice.</v>

2326
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.800
<v Speaker 1>That's an archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2327
01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Annoying wife.</v>

01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:18.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm exacerbating the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get very triggered and annoyed by </v>

2331
01:43:18.391 --> 01:43:21.301
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the stereotype that guys are dumb </v>

<v Speaker 1>really annoys me and I dumb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Guys are you're designed to only.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Most people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2335
01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I just mean like in terms of why don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember my friend Audrey's name.</v>

2336
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:33.751
<v Speaker 1>You've met her three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like guys are only really </v>

2337
01:43:33.751 --> 01:43:35.641
<v Speaker 1>remembered designed to remember things </v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's some kind of threat attached </v>

2338
01:43:35.641 --> 01:43:38.821
<v Speaker 1>to it and it's just your brains are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like we're designed to sort of </v>

2339
01:43:38.821 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 1>in a team way for me to be hypervigilant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

2340
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking lion and you go break </v>
<v Speaker 1>down everything to like some primitive </v>

2341
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.180
<v Speaker 1>tribe that is always think there.</v>

2342
01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:54.370
<v Speaker 1>People find things memorable because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interesting and they're </v>

2343
01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:55.880
<v Speaker 1>fascinating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that are totally unthreatened.</v>

2344
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Is Andrea interesting or fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

2345
01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:58.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Algeria,</v>

2346
01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>so maybe she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's cool as fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Dr Audrey Ph day,</v>

2348
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:07.010
<v Speaker 1>but I just mean like some benign friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your girl or whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's something that I love about my,</v>

2351
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.170
<v Speaker 1>a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're fixing something,</v>

2352
01:44:15.171 --> 01:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I want you to only be focusing on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>

2353
01:44:16.851 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't multitask in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2354
01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I just think they call guys dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as glorifying a neurotic </v>

2355
01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:24.830
<v Speaker 1>multitasking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2356
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>overworked or glorification of busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>

2357
01:44:28.190 --> 01:44:30.870
<v Speaker 1>That's the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys that are just like simple.</v>

2358
01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:31.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

2359
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:36.080
<v Speaker 1>People are so varied though I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>more hesitant to generalize.</v>

2360
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:41.140
<v Speaker 1>The older men or women are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are stupid.</v>

2361
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:44.870
<v Speaker 1>That thing is just to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm general.</v>

2362
01:44:44.871 --> 01:44:49.871
<v Speaker 1>It's just a generalization that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really not helpful at all and </v>

2363
01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:54.410
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes people comfort.</v>

2364
01:44:54.411 --> 01:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It gives them comfort to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>classify people.</v>

2365
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2366
01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2367
01:44:59.421 --> 01:45:01.670
<v Speaker 1>what happened with Debbie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a crazy bitch.</v>

2368
01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to say she's a crazy bitch.</v>

2369
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Instead of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2370
01:45:05.181 --> 01:45:10.181
<v Speaker 1>I was raised kind of fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really don't like her because she </v>

2371
01:45:10.181 --> 01:45:14.550
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't heard his child secure </v>

2372
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.570
<v Speaker 1>stronger than I did and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got.</v>

2373
01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.860
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's smarter than me on this too much </v>

2374
01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:20.270
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did we get on that topic?</v>

2375
01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:21.470
<v Speaker 1>There was something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2377
01:45:24.921 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 1>hot load stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something about the Beta males.</v>

2378
01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh.</v>

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:55.250
<v Speaker 5>fertilize my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then put it in the freezer and then put </v>

2404
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:55.250
<v Speaker 5>it back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My body seems so creepy.</v>

2405
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:59.361
<v Speaker 5>Zombie demands total science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 5>embryo gets frozen and then you could </v>

2406
01:46:59.431 --> 01:47:02.880
<v Speaker 5>turn that into life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it only healthy choice dinner.</v>

2407
01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:47:03.330 --> 01:47:05.490
<v Speaker 5>But it only works like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2409
01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 5>So an embryo will eventually become a </v>
<v Speaker 5>human being,</v>

2410
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:11.100
<v Speaker 5>so that little embryo was already </v>
<v Speaker 5>fertilizes.</v>

2411
01:47:11.101 --> 01:47:13.980
<v Speaker 5>The egg gets fertilized and you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>freeze that,</v>

2412
01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.310
<v Speaker 5>but you can't freeze a 13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

2413
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:22.310
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying know like there's a </v>

2414
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:24.141
<v Speaker 5>cutoff period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should we could at some point just not </v>

2415
01:47:24.141 --> 01:47:24.141
<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we could.</v>

2416
01:47:24.141 --> 01:47:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to happen.</v>

2417
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.720
<v Speaker 5>I think these fucking [inaudible] guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these assholes that are shooting stem </v>

2418
01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.160
<v Speaker 5>cells and the DM people's heads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fuckers</v>

2419
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.280
<v Speaker 4>look lot of alive people who need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2420
01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.730
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a crime I,</v>

2421
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean I imagined it because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a brain and blood.</v>

2422
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:42.730
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be warm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

2423
01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:47.900
<v Speaker 5>Maria's not be warm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Humans I guess have to a certain body </v>

2424
01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:47.900
<v Speaker 5>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2425
01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:48.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like some Austin powers </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

2426
01:47:48.690 --> 01:47:51.900
<v Speaker 5>but even a sell to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was an individual cell.</v>

2427
01:47:51.901 --> 01:47:56.901
<v Speaker 5>Like if the egg has been fertilized and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the creative one sell the idea that you </v>

2428
01:47:56.901 --> 01:48:01.011
<v Speaker 5>could freeze that fucking cell before it</v>
<v Speaker 5>divides and becomes a full on human </v>

2429
01:48:01.011 --> 01:48:04.611
<v Speaker 5>being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you could freeze that one </v>

2430
01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:04.611
<v Speaker 5>cell and then regenerate it.</v>

2431
01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:06.640
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

2432
01:48:06.650 --> 01:48:09.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how people do like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so.</v>

2433
01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's why I tried to read so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much yet because I'm like,</v>

2434
01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:16.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how I can't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what these people are doing </v>

2435
01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:16.860
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not even doing it.</v>

2436
01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so standard today too.</v>

2437
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:22.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is so really fascinating because </v>

2438
01:48:22.330 --> 01:48:23.930
<v Speaker 5>if you brought this concept to someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>200 years ago or even 100 years ago,</v>

2439
01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:25.280
<v Speaker 5>they think you're out of your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind,</v>

2440
01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.650
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds fucking crazy.</v>

2441
01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:31.180
<v Speaker 5>It does sound like I'm sucking them out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your fucking over.</v>

2442
01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2443
01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.830
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember John and Kate plus </v>
<v Speaker 5>eight?</v>

2444
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that crazy lady.</v>

2445
01:48:36.591 --> 01:48:41.591
<v Speaker 5>They shot the fucking those chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside of her body to make her more </v>

2446
01:48:41.591 --> 01:48:44.140
<v Speaker 5>fertile and she gave birth to six kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.730
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>OCTOMOM.</v>

2448
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

2449
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:53.070
<v Speaker 4>Optima optima have a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the only reason I remember that </v>

2450
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:54.920
<v Speaker 4>because people on twitter say I looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>like her,</v>

2451
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're just being mean.</v>

2452
01:48:59.390 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2453
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:01.780
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a,</v>

2454
01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:04.220
<v Speaker 4>it I've never felt like more of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>science project,</v>

2455
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the human body that kind of a </v>

2456
01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.201
<v Speaker 4>miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he's this sort of intersection </v>

2457
01:49:11.201 --> 01:49:13.460
<v Speaker 4>between technology and life or like </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother nature is so weird.</v>

2458
01:49:13.461 --> 01:49:18.461
<v Speaker 4>It's like he's in there and he's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a wand and it says this with the </v>

2459
01:49:18.461 --> 01:49:20.900
<v Speaker 4>soul and now you're going and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2460
01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:21.790
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2461
01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:24.620
<v Speaker 4>it's not a very sexy or romantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>

2462
01:49:24.621 --> 01:49:29.621
<v Speaker 4>It's very clinical sort of rough and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's and in my ovaries are on a high def</v>

2463
01:49:30.081 --> 01:49:33.170
<v Speaker 4>television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like that for those two things</v>

2464
01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:38.171
<v Speaker 4>to be in this like intersect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so weird and you're just </v>

2465
01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.680
<v Speaker 4>looking at all your follicles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was convinced for the first couple</v>

2466
01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:41.720
<v Speaker 4>of sessions that it was just like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>feed,</v>

2467
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:43.820
<v Speaker 4>like everyone saw the same feed because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2468
01:49:43.821 --> 01:49:46.640
<v Speaker 4>there's just no way you can see inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>my body.</v>

2469
01:49:46.670 --> 01:49:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

2470
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2471
01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:52.150
<v Speaker 1>this is just a video tape you put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody comes in.</v>

2472
01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:57.151
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way you can see inside </v>

2473
01:49:57.151 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 1>my body is dark on the inside obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I intellectually,</v>

2474
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't fathom it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just to,</v>

2475
01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:03.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to.</v>

2476
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Obviously everybody is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it seems like all my follicles,</v>

2477
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.970
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one's a different size.</v>

2478
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you know that it looks </v>

2479
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 1>like a haunted house to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand anything.</v>

2480
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It looks like paranormal activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks like a fucking </v>

2481
01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:17.730
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2482
01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:19.220
<v Speaker 1>and then I go and then I'm sure enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get like four.</v>

2483
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I looked like I was like four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>months pregnant,</v>

2484
01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing these shots every day and </v>

2485
01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

2486
01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:30.480
<v Speaker 1>this is so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes your stomach stick out more </v>

2487
01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:31.700
<v Speaker 1>because I had 18 big swollen ecs.</v>

2488
01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a picture of it somewhere.</v>

2489
01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it to you and I look like five</v>
<v Speaker 1>months pregnant and it's just like,</v>

2490
01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:41.920
<v Speaker 1>it's usually caused for our alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to spend money to look like that.</v>

2492
01:50:41.921 --> 01:50:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2493
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go in and they suck them </v>

2494
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:48.000
<v Speaker 1>all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what made you decide to do that?</v>

2495
01:50:48.370 --> 01:50:50.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one day have a kid,</v>

2496
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I am going to one day have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said to me was this,</v>

2497
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:55.360
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2498
01:50:55.930 --> 01:50:58.300
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my next year and a half,</v>

2499
01:50:58.301 --> 01:51:03.301
<v Speaker 1>two years it's gonna be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>hectic and I'm probably not going to </v>

2500
01:51:03.301 --> 01:51:03.301
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2501
01:51:03.301 --> 01:51:03.301
<v Speaker 1>this might not be for your first or </v>
<v Speaker 1>second kid.</v>

2502
01:51:03.301 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It could be a for your fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're 44 and you're like,</v>

2503
01:51:06.461 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have one more.</v>

2504
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Or like I'm going to have a surrogate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2505
01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was literally just like an insurance </v>

2506
01:51:14.670 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A adopting.</v>

2507
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So adopting is a kind of a nightmare.</v>

2508
01:51:17.351 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 1>A lot of my friends have been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

2509
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:23.820
<v Speaker 1>You sign up for it and you're waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the baby to be born and the mother </v>

2510
01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 1>might change their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mother has,</v>

2511
01:51:25.181 --> 01:51:30.181
<v Speaker 1>I think two days to decide whether she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to keep the baby or not after she </v>

2512
01:51:30.181 --> 01:51:33.631
<v Speaker 1>gives birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course when her brain is </v>

2513
01:51:33.631 --> 01:51:35.341
<v Speaker 1>fade and oxytocin after having it and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of couples go down to nine month </v>

2514
01:51:35.341 --> 01:51:39.451
<v Speaker 1>journey and don't get a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do it from a different </v>

2515
01:51:39.451 --> 01:51:41.941
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little different of a couple of </v>

2516
01:51:41.941 --> 01:51:41.941
<v Speaker 1>gay friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hard surrogate.</v>

2517
01:51:41.941 --> 01:51:46.470
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surrogate surrogate even for gay </v>

2518
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.470
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2519
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess they use their own come.</v>

2520
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just a cooler shot it into a </v>

2521
01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Turkey based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to have been one or the other.</v>

2522
01:51:51.791 --> 01:51:56.791
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2523
01:51:56.921 --> 01:52:00.040
<v Speaker 1>they paid this woman for the last 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand.</v>

2524
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:05.300
<v Speaker 1>They paid her for a year and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby was born she decided to keep </v>

2525
01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:05.300
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2526
01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the lawyers fault.</v>

2527
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 1>There must've been something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's decided to keep it.</v>

2528
01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could force a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2529
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:15.390
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to force her to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money back or some of the money </v>

2530
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.390
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2531
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you could sue for the money back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know the.</v>

2532
01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:18.730
<v Speaker 1>You could take the baby away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2533
01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.230
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother has.</v>

2534
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I think all the rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think once the baby comes out of her </v>

2535
01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:25.690
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's probably like,</v>

2536
01:52:25.691 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my fucking baby.</v>

2537
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.830
<v Speaker 1>How do you want to make this work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2538
01:52:29.890 --> 01:52:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really a total chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonding thing.</v>

2539
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:37.950
<v Speaker 1>We'll also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The might've been like some severe </v>

2540
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:40.261
<v Speaker 1>desperation in her life that made her </v>
<v Speaker 1>take this position as being a surrogate </v>

2541
01:52:40.261 --> 01:52:42.670
<v Speaker 1>mother in the first place and the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave her.</v>

2542
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Might have alleviated St Louis problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were causing</v>

2543
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.620
<v Speaker 5>her to be so desperate that she wanted </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have a surrogate baby.</v>

2544
01:52:48.650 --> 01:52:51.290
<v Speaker 5>That's very interesting problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dark for them.</v>

2545
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:53.510
<v Speaker 5>It was like really breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was heartbreaking,</v>

2546
01:52:53.511 --> 01:52:54.980
<v Speaker 5>but it was also like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2547
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:57.260
<v Speaker 5>well it's all so fucking baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2548
01:52:57.261 --> 01:52:58.680
<v Speaker 5>she grew in her body like</v>

2549
01:52:59.020 --> 01:52:59.980
<v Speaker 2>logically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So have,</v>

2550
01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends with surrogates and and you.</v>

2551
01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:07.530
<v Speaker 2>It's very stressful because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>micromanage what they're eating if </v>

2552
01:53:07.530 --> 01:53:11.281
<v Speaker 2>they're sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But something that was helpful that I </v>

2553
01:53:11.281 --> 01:53:12.670
<v Speaker 2>learned was that if a baby's not getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nutrients it needs it,</v>

2554
01:53:12.671 --> 01:53:17.671
<v Speaker 2>we'll take it from his mother's bones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a surrogate is eating </v>

2555
01:53:17.671 --> 01:53:17.880
<v Speaker 2>McDonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids</v>

2556
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 5>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the carrier.</v>

2557
01:53:20.871 --> 01:53:25.871
<v Speaker 5>Is the one that's going to suffer a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little parasites just sucking and </v>

2558
01:53:25.871 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 5>fucking suck calcium out of your</v>

2559
01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.200
<v Speaker 2>babies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2560
01:53:27.201 --> 01:53:29.630
<v Speaker 2>They suck up brain cells from the mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2561
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking vampires.</v>

2562
01:53:31.650 --> 01:53:32.320
<v Speaker 2>So dominant.</v>

2563
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Ten percent of their.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2564
01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.360
<v Speaker 5>they're just tired all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think is what it is.</v>

2565
01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 5>They're duplicating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like,</v>

2566
01:53:41.421 --> 01:53:43.960
<v Speaker 5>it's a metamorphosis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a fucking piss.</v>

2567
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 5>A lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a nightmare.</v>

2568
01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:47.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just crazy that that's the energy.</v>

2569
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:53.740
<v Speaker 5>It's the ultimate buyer of traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that we look forward to the </v>

2570
01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:54.950
<v Speaker 5>most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that sells cars and fucking TV</v>

2571
01:53:54.951 --> 01:53:58.110
<v Speaker 5>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long legs and sax and hate.</v>

2572
01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.400
<v Speaker 5>And what is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about coming in someone and making </v>

2573
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:03.400
<v Speaker 5>a person in their body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2574
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:07.250
<v Speaker 5>it's really like this ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>biological trick of replication.</v>

2575
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.640
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2576
01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 5>have you ever heard of this book called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid name,</v>

2577
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:14.450
<v Speaker 5>but cubits poisoned arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about what orgasms do to your brain</v>

2578
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:20.020
<v Speaker 5>and the whole sort of theory is to not </v>
<v Speaker 5>have an orgasm unless you're going to </v>

2579
01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.140
<v Speaker 5>actually procreate because of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>chemicals that are released.</v>

2580
01:54:21.450 --> 01:54:22.160
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2581
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:24.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who wrote that book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of monster?</v>

2582
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sex addicts that.</v>

2583
01:54:27.111 --> 01:54:32.111
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the best way to clear your mind </v>

2584
01:54:32.111 --> 01:54:32.111
<v Speaker 5>is to shoot a load.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

2585
01:54:32.111 --> 01:54:34.760
<v Speaker 5>but it's something about your golf and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your thought process is so much clear.</v>

2586
01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Like there's so many times that I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>told my friends like,</v>

2587
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:40.020
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to do mood.</v>

2588
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:42.050
<v Speaker 5>She's pressuring me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jerk off first.</v>

2589
01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.800
<v Speaker 5>Then think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just go jerk off man.</v>

2590
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Tell me after you jerked off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to deal with all this </v>

2591
01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:49.930
<v Speaker 5>emotional bullshit that's being thrown </v>
<v Speaker 5>at you.</v>

2592
01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

2593
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Will you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send this to you.</v>

2594
01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading it and while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading I was like,</v>

2595
01:54:55.091 --> 01:54:56.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this makes a lot of sense.</v>

2596
01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live like that,</v>

2597
01:54:57.671 --> 01:54:59.110
<v Speaker 2>but it makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2598
01:54:59.111 --> 01:55:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's something about how if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in love with someone long term,</v>

2599
01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:07.320
<v Speaker 2>because if you have too many orgasms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you produce dopamine and then after,</v>

2600
01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.060
<v Speaker 2>because essentially we're designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>procreate like you said,</v>

2601
01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:12.580
<v Speaker 2>and then the female starts producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxytocin,</v>

2602
01:55:12.581 --> 01:55:15.550
<v Speaker 2>but the mail starts being less </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in the brain is like,</v>

2603
01:55:15.551 --> 01:55:20.551
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have to go procreate with </v>

2604
01:55:20.551 --> 01:55:21.661
<v Speaker 2>someone else because our brain doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that are 6 billion people on the </v>

2605
01:55:21.661 --> 01:55:23.020
<v Speaker 2>planet and that we don't need to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke rate with a lot of different moms.</v>

2606
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's something about if you want to </v>

2607
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.280
<v Speaker 2>be in a relationship for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a tantric type thing.</v>

2608
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:31.720
<v Speaker 2>It kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2609
01:55:31.721 --> 01:55:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's basically about.</v>

2610
01:55:33.761 --> 01:55:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I stopped reading after like four pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

2611
01:55:35.501 --> 01:55:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to fucking is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about keeping Oxytocin,</v>

2612
01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.580
<v Speaker 2>the bonding chemical alive with couples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2613
01:55:42.581 --> 01:55:44.150
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying</v>

2614
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.720
<v Speaker 3>to hack couples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes they are.</v>

2615
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.840
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much does find someone that you </v>

2616
01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:50.840
<v Speaker 3>actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too easy,</v>

2617
01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:52.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kinda in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

2618
01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be done everywhere.</v>

2619
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Who would you be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do I think you should do?</v>

2620
01:55:57.570 --> 01:55:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll find somebody.</v>

2621
01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.030
<v Speaker 1>We need to find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>

2622
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:03.240

<v Speaker 1>but it's not working out obviously.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you're very smart and you're very </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambitious and you're.</v>

2630
01:56:29.341 --> 01:56:34.341
<v Speaker 3>You're interested in a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you have to have someone who </v>

2631
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.780
<v Speaker 3>is similar in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmare.</v>

2632
01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:42.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that know someone that I honestly </v>

2633
01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.710
<v Speaker 3>believe that in order for someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you because I think you're an outlier in</v>

2634
01:56:44.711 --> 01:56:47.830
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ways in that you're a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liar.</v>

2635
01:56:48.730 --> 01:56:53.020
<v Speaker 3>That outlying aspect of your personality</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're.</v>

2636
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to be an outlier in some way</v>

2637
01:56:56.771 --> 01:56:59.920
<v Speaker 3>of their own in order for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate you because otherwise they're</v>

2638
01:56:59.921 --> 01:57:02.500
<v Speaker 3>just gonna think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't keep up with this crazy bitch.</v>

2639
01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 3>This is too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2640
01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:04.870
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't sleep,</v>

2641
01:57:04.871 --> 01:57:09.871
<v Speaker 3>she gets up in the middle of night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts writing books and learn how to </v>

2642
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:09.871
<v Speaker 3>walk again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2643
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:09.871
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2644
01:57:09.871 --> 01:57:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the guy,</v>

2645
01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.070
<v Speaker 1>the grandpa from Charlotte and of bed.</v>

2646
01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.700
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of benefits to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>type of behavior.</v>

2647
01:57:16.701 --> 01:57:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're so successful.</v>

2648
01:57:18.081 --> 01:57:19.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of benefits to what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

2649
01:57:20.150 --> 01:57:24.950
<v Speaker 3>but the negative side aspect of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2650
01:57:24.951 --> 01:57:29.951
<v Speaker 3>the where I would say it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic is someone has to like for </v>

2651
01:57:29.951 --> 01:57:34.721
<v Speaker 3>companionship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to be able to keep up with </v>

2652
01:57:34.721 --> 01:57:37.481
<v Speaker 3>you or understand you or accept you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the way you think and the way you </v>

2653
01:57:38.571 --> 01:57:43.571
<v Speaker 3>approach life is extremely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the way most people do it and </v>

2654
01:57:46.371 --> 01:57:50.990
<v Speaker 3>not the way most women do it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if men are used to this certain type</v>

2655
01:57:50.991 --> 01:57:55.400
<v Speaker 3>of patterns that some women follow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have this pattern,</v>

2656
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be like,</v>

2657
01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2658
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to grow.</v>

2659
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Complains about starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2660
01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:10.200
<v Speaker 1>coconut milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camel milk,</v>

2661
01:58:10.201 --> 01:58:11.700
<v Speaker 1>what do we do it and goat's milk.</v>

2662
01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.040
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2663
01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.970
<v Speaker 3>when I hate saying stupid shit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people repeat,</v>

2664
01:58:16.971 --> 01:58:21.971
<v Speaker 3>but I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this repeated thing is when you're </v>

2665
01:58:21.971 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 3>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find something.</v>

2666
01:58:22.021 --> 01:58:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2667
01:58:22.590 --> 01:58:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2668
01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Because I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's like.</v>

2669
01:58:26.630 --> 01:58:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I think a relationship really doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work unless you yourself are ready for a</v>

2670
01:58:34.701 --> 01:58:36.790
<v Speaker 3>relationship too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good point.</v>

2671
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 3>You have to be someone that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>would want to be in a relationship with </v>

2672
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 3>it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2673
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 3>how about stop focusing on the other</v>

2674
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.130
<v Speaker 4>person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I want to date me once I get into a</v>

2675
01:58:45.131 --> 01:58:47.170
<v Speaker 4>place where I would want to date me or </v>
<v Speaker 4>marry me.</v>

2676
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2677
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:49.920
<v Speaker 3>And people think they're going to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

2678
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:55.460
<v Speaker 3>a person is going to calm them down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're going to be someone that's </v>

2679
01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:55.460
<v Speaker 3>worth dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:55.980
<v Speaker 3>That's often calm yourself down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2681
01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Solve your own problems and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2683
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I've been fucking song and dance for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first couple weeks of the relationship </v>

2684
01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:08.220
<v Speaker 3>until like a buddy of mine had this girl</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was dating for a while and then </v>

2685
01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.070
<v Speaker 3>his car broke down and he needed her to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help him.</v>

2686
01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his tire blew out and uh,</v>

2687
01:59:14.761 --> 01:59:19.761
<v Speaker 3>I forgot the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she helped him in some sort of a </v>

2688
01:59:19.761 --> 01:59:22.621
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she came and got him or something </v>

2689
01:59:22.621 --> 01:59:24.061
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she stayed over the house and </v>

2690
01:59:24.061 --> 01:59:26.641
<v Speaker 3>then the next day she texted him like </v>
<v Speaker 3>five fucking times in a row and he </v>

2691
01:59:26.641 --> 01:59:30.151
<v Speaker 3>didn't text her back and then she left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy message about now she's </v>

2692
01:59:30.151 --> 01:59:31.720
<v Speaker 3>going to need therapy and she has trust </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2693
01:59:31.721 --> 01:59:36.721
<v Speaker 3>And so it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just what the fuck he was working all </v>

2694
01:59:36.721 --> 01:59:36.721
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2695
01:59:36.721 --> 01:59:40.411
<v Speaker 3>I'm just working all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had one day where I tried to put my </v>

2696
01:59:40.411 --> 01:59:43.651
<v Speaker 3>phone aside and concentrate on my work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're just blowing up my fucking </v>

2697
01:59:43.651 --> 01:59:44.770
<v Speaker 3>phone and I didn't text you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you need therapy.</v>

2698
01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.920
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain people that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter into any sort of an intimate </v>

2699
01:59:50.021 --> 01:59:53.670
<v Speaker 3>relationship with them and you're taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the burden of all this,</v>

2700
01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:58.340
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly why I all this self </v>
<v Speaker 4>shed.</v>

2701
01:59:58.390 --> 02:00:01.630
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it comes up super masturbatory and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like narcissistic,</v>

2702
02:00:01.631 --> 02:00:03.700
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm done being crazy.</v>

2703
02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not crazy by saying I'm done being </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2704
02:00:09.850 --> 02:00:12.160
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>

2705
02:00:12.161 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cute in your twenties.</v>

2706
02:00:13.751 --> 02:00:16.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not cute in your thirties to text a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy five times in a row.</v>

2707
02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:19.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't want lack of awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>

2708
02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:20.830
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I want to be able to go,</v>

2709
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my shit.</v>

2710
02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:26.731
<v Speaker 4>This has nothing to do with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I have abandoned terror and data </v>

2711
02:00:26.731 --> 02:00:26.731
<v Speaker 4>and like solve my accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terror,</v>

2712
02:00:26.731 --> 02:00:27.790
<v Speaker 4>terror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called abandonment.</v>

2713
02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:30.370
<v Speaker 4>That expression before infant maternal </v>
<v Speaker 4>disruption.</v>

2714
02:00:30.371 --> 02:00:34.700
<v Speaker 4>So I have a band Materra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means I didn't hit the brakes,</v>

2715
02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:37.870
<v Speaker 4>were always in here and it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as we start winding down,</v>

2716
02:00:37.871 --> 02:00:40.660
<v Speaker 4>I'd throw out some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sperm allergy,</v>

2717
02:00:40.690 --> 02:00:42.090
<v Speaker 4>environmental disruption.</v>

2718
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 4>What's going on with your foot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice talking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Get outta here.</v>

2720
02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.390
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2721
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:56.320
<v Speaker 4>when you didn't get enough eye contact </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a kid,</v>

2722
02:00:56.321 --> 02:00:58.360
<v Speaker 4>basically you have infant maternal </v>
<v Speaker 4>disruption,</v>

2723
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:00.490
<v Speaker 4>like you weren't able to get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection.</v>

2724
02:01:00.491 --> 02:01:01.410
<v Speaker 4>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2725
02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 4>when you don't get a text back or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2726
02:01:04.241 --> 02:01:06.880
<v Speaker 4>it starts triggering really old </v>
<v Speaker 4>abandonment terror.</v>

2727
02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>messages,</v>

2730
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to get control of your own </v>

<v Speaker 1>So in program we don't go to the problem</v>

2743
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:49.631
<v Speaker 1>for the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like if the problem is you're </v>

2744
02:01:49.631 --> 02:01:49.631
<v Speaker 1>not texting me back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go to you and say,</v>

2745
02:01:49.631 --> 02:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>text me back,</v>

2746
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go figure out the solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then take the solution to the </v>

2747
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the relationship.</v>

2748
02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm a big believer in the path of </v>
<v Speaker 1>least resistance when it comes to </v>

2749
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:04.511
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone doesn't want to text you </v>

2750
02:02:04.511 --> 02:02:06.671
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably shouldn't be hanging out </v>

2751
02:02:06.671 --> 02:02:06.671
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty simple.</v>

2752
02:02:06.671 --> 02:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So like to like chase after people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an instinct.</v>

2753
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>People have it like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they call me back?</v>

2754
02:02:10.611 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come you didn't text me back?</v>

2755
02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You fuck a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're not texting back and visit</v>

2756
02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>a Sikh people whose approval we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have her whose attention we don't have </v>

2757
02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>because we didn't get it or why I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>text messages and even voicemail </v>

2758
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:29.291
<v Speaker 1>messages in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way or weird in that like you send </v>

2759
02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:32.531
<v Speaker 1>somebody something and then you wait for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to respond and you hold and the </v>

2760
02:02:32.531 --> 02:02:32.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2761
02:02:32.531 --> 02:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>come on out there.</v>

2762
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>What do we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like send a raven to fucking scroll</v>

2763
02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>attention because it's like if I text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2764
02:02:39.490 --> 02:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>text me back and then I see that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted an instagram.</v>

2765
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>There's this whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which did happen the other day.</v>

2766
02:02:46.851 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Joe Jogi definitely.</v>

2767
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>But there's this new thing of how I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see all the other things you're doing on</v>

2768
02:02:53.871 --> 02:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>your phone instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm now all of a sudden like,</v>

2769
02:02:57.741 --> 02:03:01.280
<v Speaker 1>well you fucking responded to three's </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tweets,</v>

2770
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock from fucking Ronda,</v>

2771
02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:07.430
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't text me back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns into that shotgun,</v>

2772
02:03:07.431 --> 02:03:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to start with her.</v>

2773
02:03:12.370 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Love her very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one you're talking about?</v>

2774
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2775
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>have the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>

2776
02:03:17.110 --> 02:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Rousey Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were just making people's </v>

2777
02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

2778
02:03:22.110 --> 02:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was trying to think of someone </v>

2779
02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>who you might tweet with it or tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>about or something.</v>

2780
02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2781
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I think with all of these other </v>

2782
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes things,</v>

2783
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>it makes it harder to just solely focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the purity of did he text me back or </v>

2784
02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he didn't text me back,</v>

2785
02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:37.520
<v Speaker 1>but he did all these other things on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

2786
02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 1>It was just human beings enter into </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

2787
02:03:40.581 --> 02:03:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Even friendships like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say relationship,</v>

2788
02:03:43.371 --> 02:03:48.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like any time that you're relating </v>

2789
02:03:48.371 --> 02:03:51.161
<v Speaker 1>to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the person that you're hanging </v>

2790
02:03:51.161 --> 02:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>around with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change how you are like you,</v>

2791
02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:58.400
<v Speaker 1>you are who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have like this base and then you </v>

2792
02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:59.240
<v Speaker 1>might be lighter around certain people </v>
<v Speaker 1>or friend.</v>

2793
02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a chemical reaction that </v>

2794
02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:04.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to people's personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instantly.</v>

2795
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:07.070
<v Speaker 1>When I see a comic I stopped trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be funny.</v>

2796
02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2797
02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like don't ever make jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I'm going to comment,</v>

2798
02:04:12.741 --> 02:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2799
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to try to make you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2800
02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:20.081
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like when you're around </v>

2801
02:04:20.081 --> 02:04:21.731
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't comics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're almost obligated because I </v>

2802
02:04:21.731 --> 02:04:21.731
<v Speaker 1>know you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2803
02:04:21.731 --> 02:04:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like your thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just different reactions.</v>

2804
02:04:22.521 --> 02:04:27.521
<v Speaker 1>Certain people trigger different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like that may be your own </v>

2805
02:04:27.521 --> 02:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>expectations of what you think people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>

2806
02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Could be or it's like the performance or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show or the costume I put on to </v>

2807
02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>avoid intimacy or to having to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to somebody.</v>

2808
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that like with every day in</v>

2809
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v Speaker 5>every hour and every time you obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all these things and all these </v>

2810
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:46.041
<v Speaker 5>different paths that you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every day gets a little better </v>

2811
02:04:46.041 --> 02:04:46.041
<v Speaker 5>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get a little better at it,</v>

2812
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:47.280

2813
02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2814
02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:50.300
<v Speaker 4>And if I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2815
02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:55.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it depends on also what comes up </v>

2816
02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:55.360
<v Speaker 4>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2817
02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.890
<v Speaker 4>sometimes you're like fucking nailing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then a trigger comes along and </v>

2818
02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:01.711
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that was a trigger </v>

2819

<v Speaker 4>that was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2820
02:05:01.711 --> 02:05:03.900
<v Speaker 4>or like a totally new stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dynamic comes along.</v>

2821
02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:07.190
<v Speaker 4>The instagram is invented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm nailing it with guys they can,</v>

2822
02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:08.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to text me back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel great.</v>

2823
02:05:08.721 --> 02:05:12.590
<v Speaker 4>And then they put up my shit now </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram was fucking invented and now I</v>

2824
02:05:12.591 --> 02:05:14.540
<v Speaker 4>have to see what they're doing and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to compare,</v>

2825
02:05:14.541 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

2826
02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:19.550
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our environments are changing so fast.</v>

2827
02:05:19.551 --> 02:05:24.551
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for our sort of emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental progress to keep up with all </v>

2828
02:05:24.551 --> 02:05:29.051
<v Speaker 4>these new sort of curve balls unless you</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn your phone block and should off </v>

2829
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.150
<v Speaker 4>just all like have you ever.</v>

2830
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have to put so like a chastity belt</v>

2831
02:05:34.581 --> 02:05:36.200
<v Speaker 4>on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2832
02:05:36.250 --> 02:05:36.630
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2833
02:05:36.650 --> 02:05:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I have to protect and when I drive I </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put in the backseat because I </v>

2834
02:05:41.650 --> 02:05:44.441
<v Speaker 4>will text and drive in the back seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it in the back seat because I </v>

2835
02:05:44.441 --> 02:05:44.900
<v Speaker 4>don't trust myself because I literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>will just look,</v>

2836
02:05:44.901 --> 02:05:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I'll just be driving and I'll look down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden I'm on my phone.</v>

2837
02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2838
02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:51.530
<v Speaker 4>This is so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so you go unconscious.</v>

2839
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I rear ended somebody like.</v>

2840
02:05:54.081 --> 02:05:59.081
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't like email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally just looked down at my </v>

2841
02:05:59.081 --> 02:05:59.081
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like pulling up to a stop sign and</v>

2842
02:05:59.081 --> 02:06:01.820
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was stopped and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2844
02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:07.490
<v Speaker 4>texting is now worse than drunk driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More people die from texting and driving</v>

2845
02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:10.340
<v Speaker 4>and driving and I don't even think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2846
02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:12.260
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's not going to happen to</v>

2847
02:06:12.261 --> 02:06:14.510
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what magical fucking addict</v>

2848
02:06:14.511 --> 02:06:16.610
<v Speaker 4>thinking I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I literally will just like look down</v>

2849
02:06:16.611 --> 02:06:18.140
<v Speaker 4>at my phone and I ran into this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Totally my fault.</v>

2851
02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be my rock bottom.</v>

2852
02:06:22.730 --> 02:06:27.730
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a little ding and I was </v>

2853
02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:27.730
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That needed to happen.</v>

2854
02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:27.730
<v Speaker 4>I need,</v>

2855
02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:31.190
<v Speaker 5>don't you think that your ideas of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to happen or based on what's </v>

2856
02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:32.070
<v Speaker 5>already happened and nothing's happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet,</v>

2857
02:06:32.071 --> 02:06:32.790
<v Speaker 5>so you assume,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2858
02:06:32.791 --> 02:06:33.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm driving.</v>

2859
02:06:33.991 --> 02:06:36.290
<v Speaker 5>Nothing happens when I'm driving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm finding the valley.</v>

2860
02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 5>What's the,</v>

2861
02:06:37.730 --> 02:06:39.470
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to die in a car </v>
<v Speaker 4>accident.</v>

2862
02:06:39.471 --> 02:06:41.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the story I wrote for myself,</v>

2863
02:06:41.841 --> 02:06:44.630
<v Speaker 4>but no one gives a fuck about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has that script,</v>

2864
02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:45.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's isn't.</v>

2865

<v Speaker 4>Everyone isn't running around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2866
02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:49.490
<v Speaker 4>trying to make sure I stay alive</v>

2867
02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:54.570
<v Speaker 5>and that brings it all back to like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>go into Vietnam and you experiencing of </v>

2868
02:06:54.570 --> 02:06:58.480
<v Speaker 5>another possibility that like you or I </v>
<v Speaker 5>were both really lucky they were born in</v>

2869
02:06:58.481 --> 02:07:00.820
<v Speaker 5>America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were born white,</v>

2870

<v Speaker 5>wealthy people in America too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean not born it but you know,</v>

2871

<v Speaker 5>I wasn't either but we're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're lucky as fuck.</v>

2872
02:07:08.471 --> 02:07:10.780
<v Speaker 5>Like this situation with this situation </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't possible.</v>

2873
02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:11.670
<v Speaker 5>Literally live in Vr.</v>

2874

<v Speaker 4>because when everyone's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2877
02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.800

<v Speaker 4>I don't feel good.</v>

2879
02:07:25.301 --> 02:07:30.301

<v Speaker 4>When you think about having sicknesses </v>

2880
02:07:30.301 --> 02:07:31.810
<v Speaker 4>are just distractions though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2881
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Lyme disease or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fight if you really.</v>

2882
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry.</v>

2883
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Tim Ferriss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sorry.</v>

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.490
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is lyme disease?</v>

2885
02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:40.800
<v Speaker 4>He had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2886
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:42.340
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think really bad.</v>

2887
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:43.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

2888
02:07:43.691 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired.</v>

2889
02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 4>I think I have lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like no,</v>

2890
02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:48.460
<v Speaker 4>people really have lyme disease or </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are like,</v>

2891
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:49.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm allergic to gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2892
02:07:49.601 --> 02:07:50.940
<v Speaker 4>do you have celiac disease?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you,</v>

2893
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:52.930
<v Speaker 4>do you just need to be sick because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets you attention,</v>

2894
02:07:52.931 --> 02:07:57.931
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you go to a place where people </v>

2895
02:07:57.931 --> 02:08:00.601
<v Speaker 4>are actually saying and actually have </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems and it just,</v>

2896
02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:05.820
<v Speaker 4>it just really changes your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that Louis C K bit </v>

2897
02:08:06.251 --> 02:08:08.430
<v Speaker 4>about being white?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably,</v>

2898
02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.320
<v Speaker 4>but it makes me think of the one cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2899
02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:12.970
<v Speaker 4>cause I was thinking this isn't a bit I </v>
<v Speaker 4>do obviously,</v>

2900
02:08:12.971 --> 02:08:14.680
<v Speaker 4>but I just remember after being in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam,</v>

2901
02:08:14.681 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should just walk around all the time.</v>

2902
02:08:16.211 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>

2903
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 4>This is so cool.</v>

2904
02:08:20.150 --> 02:08:22.750
<v Speaker 4>Like we should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should just constantly be like,</v>

2905
02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:24.790
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is water in this bottle.</v>

2906
02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:30.160
<v Speaker 5>He has this amazing bit where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could go back to any time in history</v>

2907
02:08:30.221 --> 02:08:32.580
<v Speaker 5>and it would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2908
02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:35.470
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing about being white and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like being white is great.</v>

2909
02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:37.450
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go back 200 years ago.</v>

2910
02:08:37.451 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to worry about being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>slave is like</v>

2911
02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:45.540
<v Speaker 4>just white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irish people didn't have it so good for </v>

2912
02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:48.181
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While there's definitely some mean it's </v>

2913
02:08:48.181 --> 02:08:48.210
<v Speaker 4>a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but take that low.</v>

2914
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:52.130
<v Speaker 4>What about the Irish found little </v>
<v Speaker 4>debunking your bit,</v>

2915
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:57.910
<v Speaker 4>but he also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing about everything is amazing </v>

2916
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.910
<v Speaker 4>and all we do is complain about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the flying and people.</v>

2917
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Like my flight was $45.</v>

2918
02:08:59.110 --> 02:09:03.070
<v Speaker 5>I went on this hunting trip in Prince of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wales Island,</v>

2919
02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:06.250
<v Speaker 5>which is in Alaska and it's unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 5>rainy.</v>

2920
02:09:06.251 --> 02:09:11.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean we were just drenched for six </v>
<v Speaker 5>days and I just thought in my head for </v>

2921
02:09:11.251 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 5>some reason that you'd be dry when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get in the tent.</v>

2922
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:14.170
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2923
02:09:14.171 --> 02:09:15.460
<v Speaker 5>once you get the tech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be dry,</v>

2924
02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:19.120
<v Speaker 5>but you never really get dry because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>air is wet and there's mist everywhere,</v>

2925
02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:21.400
<v Speaker 5>so everything's wet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're sleeping bags soaking wet.</v>

2926
02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:24.070
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that saves you and keeps </v>
<v Speaker 5>you warm is the fact that you're wearing</v>

2927
02:09:24.071 --> 02:09:29.071
<v Speaker 5>wool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wool retains body heat even when it's </v>

2928
02:09:29.071 --> 02:09:33.091
<v Speaker 5>wet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unlike cotton and a lot of synthetic </v>

2929
02:09:33.091 --> 02:09:33.091
<v Speaker 5>fabrics don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2930
02:09:33.091 --> 02:09:34.630
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But wool is amazing.</v>

2931
02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:35.900
<v Speaker 5>It's an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2932
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:36.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an animals.</v>

2933
02:09:36.491 --> 02:09:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like when you have wool socks on,</v>

2934
02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:40.390
<v Speaker 5>even if your feet are wet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're still warm.</v>

2935
02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Wool is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Shit is just so important for people</v>

2936
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:48.110
<v Speaker 5>that are in the outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like wool undergarment probably.</v>

2937
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:50.980
<v Speaker 5>I think wolves get them more than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cold,</v>

2938
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:54.000
<v Speaker 4>but I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2939
02:09:54.001 --> 02:09:54.650
<v Speaker 4>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2940
02:09:54.651 --> 02:09:55.130
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2941
02:09:55.150 --> 02:09:56.480
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought you meant wolf hair.</v>

2942
02:09:56.481 --> 02:09:57.490
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves have.</v>

2943
02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

2944
02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:00.290
<v Speaker 4>That's their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their hair is a wall.</v>

2945
02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

2946
02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.370
<v Speaker 5>Point was that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2947
02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:06.060
<v Speaker 5>so six days in this soaked environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just every day,</v>

2948
02:10:06.061 --> 02:10:08.880
<v Speaker 5>just being just completely wet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's wet.</v>

2949
02:10:08.910 --> 02:10:10.560
<v Speaker 5>Everything you do is what your face is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

2950
02:10:10.561 --> 02:10:15.561
<v Speaker 5>A sheen that you could feel it on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're just wet and cold and </v>

2951
02:10:15.561 --> 02:10:18.600
<v Speaker 5>that came back and it was sunny and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was 80 and I was like,</v>

2952
02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:23.660
<v Speaker 5>this is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was driving around in La and I'm </v>

2953
02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:23.660
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love it here.</v>

2954
02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.110
<v Speaker 5>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I called my friend Steve.</v>

2955
02:10:25.111 --> 02:10:26.410
<v Speaker 5>Same Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steven Alan.</v>

2956
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:27.750
<v Speaker 5>I called him up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2957
02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.750
<v Speaker 5>I am so fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never been this happy,</v>

2958
02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's because I was miserable for </v>
<v Speaker 5>those.</v>

2959
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:34.310
<v Speaker 5>It's so important</v>

2960
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:35.440
<v Speaker 4>to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every shade it.</v>

2961
02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in,</v>

2962
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 4>in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2963
02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:41.870
<v Speaker 4>they wear masks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went for a run with this motherfucker.</v>

2964
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Who back to your point about flat feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like the marathon guy who was like,</v>

2965
02:10:45.321 --> 02:10:46.900
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to run barefooted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2966
02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:52.020
<v Speaker 4>So he's barefoot run guy and this was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first non barefoot Ron who's done </v>

2967
02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:52.500
<v Speaker 4>because it was in Vietnam and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>

02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:56.480
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't last nightmare and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>dead animals.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was dysentery.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2972
02:11:03.141 --> 02:11:08.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just like three year old </v>

2973
02:11:08.141 --> 02:11:09.340
<v Speaker 4>toddlers just running businesses can </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally like,</v>

2974
02:11:09.710 --> 02:11:10.870
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2975
02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.890
<v Speaker 4>do you work here like you literally will</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2976
02:11:12.891 --> 02:11:17.891
<v Speaker 4>so I'll send you some of the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll see a kid just at a store alone </v>

2977
02:11:17.891 --> 02:11:17.891
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is avenue?</v>

2978
02:11:17.891 --> 02:11:20.990
<v Speaker 4>So fucking dangerous and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's in mass,</v>

2979
02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.760
<v Speaker 2>they can't breathe the oxygen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we went for a run and I came back </v>

2980
02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:29.260
<v Speaker 2>and I felt like I had smoked four packs </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cigarettes and I came back to La.</v>

2981
02:11:29.261 --> 02:11:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And even just doing that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little mini miracle.</v>

2982
02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a story that was written about </v>

2983
02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:41.971
<v Speaker 3>Mark Zuckerberg who was in China and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>went for a run during like one of the </v>

2984
02:11:41.971 --> 02:11:42.910
<v Speaker 3>worst days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the worst pollution days.</v>

2985
02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:45.750
<v Speaker 3>And he's out there jogging around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2986
02:11:45.810 --> 02:11:47.380
<v Speaker 3>you look at the air behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2987
02:11:47.381 --> 02:11:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're jogging into like an exhausting</v>

2988
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:51.730
<v Speaker 2>pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could he did,</v>

2989
02:11:51.731 --> 02:11:53.180
<v Speaker 2>he just doesn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2990
02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:53.830
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

2991
02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Can you wanted to experience it because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2992
02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:57.960
<v Speaker 3>just to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2993
02:11:57.961 --> 02:11:59.910
<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2994
02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:04.020
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously very thoughtful guy and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that maybe he wanted to experience</v>

2995
02:12:04.021 --> 02:12:04.680
<v Speaker 3>it was just because</v>

2996
02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.330
<v Speaker 4>just to know those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can pay for it.</v>

2997
02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Whatever happens to me so we can get new</v>
<v Speaker 4>lungs,</v>

2998
02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:14.450
<v Speaker 4>I'll just get some fucking stem cells to</v>
<v Speaker 4>regenerate Brianna Mahon,</v>

2999
02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:16.270
<v Speaker 4>my lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3000
02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:17.000
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3001
02:12:17.001 --> 02:12:18.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3002
02:12:18.021 --> 02:12:20.060
<v Speaker 2>And I also like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you see that kind of pollution,</v>

3003
02:12:20.061 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3004
02:12:21.201 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many charities and there's so</v>

3005
02:12:22.731 --> 02:12:27.731
<v Speaker 2>many fucking problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't try to solve all of them or </v>

3006
02:12:27.731 --> 02:12:27.731
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3007
02:12:27.731 --> 02:12:27.950
<v Speaker 2>such a small part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

3008
02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:29.690
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time that I was like,</v>

3009
02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I needed like only Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3010
02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.480
<v Speaker 2>there's like carbon neutral companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and companies that,</v>

3011
02:12:35.481 --> 02:12:40.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put less emissions out and stuff and </v>

3012
02:12:40.481 --> 02:12:40.481
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3013
02:12:40.481 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 2>I should start voting with things I buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3014
02:12:40.701 --> 02:12:45.701
<v Speaker 2>it's the first time I got this app that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells you what companies don't emit as </v>

3015
02:12:45.701 --> 02:12:46.430
<v Speaker 2>much pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3016
02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:47.390
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3017
02:12:47.391 --> 02:12:52.391
<v Speaker 2>I never really thought about that before</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I was breathing in like viscous </v>

3018
02:12:52.391 --> 02:12:52.391
<v Speaker 2>toxic air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3019
02:12:52.391 --> 02:12:54.640
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because just being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being,</v>

3020
02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.470
<v Speaker 3>just by the nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nature of our existence,</v>

3021
02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:04.740
<v Speaker 3>we consume constantly and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly using things that are </v>

3022
02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:09.241
<v Speaker 3>detrimental to the environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will concentrate on certain </v>

3023
02:13:09.241 --> 02:13:09.241
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3024
02:13:09.241 --> 02:13:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ride my bike everywhere.</v>

3025
02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So my carbon footprint is less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3026
02:13:11.651 --> 02:13:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but you're still using plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

3027
02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.850
<v Speaker 3>That shit goes into garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>

3028
02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:19.060
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wastes refilling.</v>

3029
02:13:19.061 --> 02:13:22.720
<v Speaker 3>What are those called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The landfills to landfills.</v>

3030
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:27.870
<v Speaker 3>They wind up getting into the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the stuff that we do has an </v>

3031
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:28.570
<v Speaker 3>effect all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

3032
02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Like this idea that you're immune </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you ride your bike everywhere or</v>

3033
02:13:32.071 --> 02:13:35.340
<v Speaker 3>because you have an electric car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one drives me fucking crazy because</v>

3034
02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:36.630
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those electric cars,</v>

3035
02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>those fucking minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those cards has apparently.</v>

3036
02:13:39.691 --> 02:13:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Cause they are not recyclable right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3037
02:13:42.501 --> 02:13:43.950
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their conflict minerals,</v>

3038
02:13:44.130 --> 02:13:46.620
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting the minerals from places</v>

3039
02:13:46.621 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

3040
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:50.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a real issue with where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting this,</v>

3041
02:13:50.610 --> 02:13:55.610
<v Speaker 3>these minerals to make these batteries </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's one of the big things about </v>

3042
02:13:55.861 --> 02:14:00.861
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the big things about Canada </v>

3043
02:14:00.861 --> 02:14:00.861
<v Speaker 3>and they found trillions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth of lithium in the,</v>

3044
02:14:00.861 --> 02:14:05.710
<v Speaker 3>in the mountains and they believe it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why we're there in </v>

3045
02:14:05.710 --> 02:14:05.710
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3046
02:14:05.710 --> 02:14:10.100
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of natural resources </v>

3047
02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:11.760
<v Speaker 3>that the Soviets wanted out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>

3048
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:16.910
<v Speaker 3>The natural gas pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main reasons why they </v>

3049
02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:20.541
<v Speaker 3>believe that some of the neo-cons we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>very interested in protecting and </v>

3050
02:14:20.541 --> 02:14:23.040
<v Speaker 3>invading Afghanistan is not just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>poppy business,</v>

3051
02:14:23.041 --> 02:14:24.870
<v Speaker 3>which is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3052
02:14:24.930 --> 02:14:28.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a giant fucking business and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that,</v>

3053
02:14:28.291 --> 02:14:33.291
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have anything to do with </v>

3054
02:14:33.291 --> 02:14:33.291
<v Speaker 3>that because it's not illegal or because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>

3055
02:14:33.291 --> 02:14:36.971
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not true because if you look at </v>

3056
02:14:36.971 --> 02:14:36.971
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam,</v>

3057
02:14:36.971 --> 02:14:39.060
<v Speaker 3>a big part of the reason why people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam,</v>

3058
02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:44.210
<v Speaker 3>why some people supportive being in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam is because they were profiting </v>

3059
02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:44.210
<v Speaker 3>off controlling the heroin trade.</v>

3060
02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:49.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a fucking trillion dollars </v>

3061
02:14:49.130 --> 02:14:52.311
<v Speaker 3>made during the Vietnam War from heroin </v>
<v Speaker 3>sales and where it was made and why and </v>

3062
02:14:52.891 --> 02:14:57.891
<v Speaker 3>who got the money and where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corruption took place and where the </v>

3063
02:14:57.891 --> 02:15:00.801
<v Speaker 3>money was being handed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all open to speculation and </v>

3064
02:15:00.801 --> 02:15:03.921
<v Speaker 3>research and maybe someone will </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually have it all figured out one </v>

3065
02:15:03.921 --> 02:15:06.861
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is there was a massive </v>

3066
02:15:06.861 --> 02:15:07.470
<v Speaker 3>amount of fucking heroin that was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved.</v>

3067
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:08.670
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3068
02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting crazy heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing happened.</v>

3069
02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I got lucky dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like that.</v>

3070
02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Your coffee is made of like coconut oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and butter that it's like white barely </v>

3071
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:22.320
<v Speaker 3>move your coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3072
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like lava.</v>

3073
02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:30.490
<v Speaker 3>It's thick plastic like my stout loads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point being that these batteries </v>

3074
02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that they're making these fucking car </v>
<v Speaker 3>batteries out of there.</v>

3075
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:40.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like Afghanistan sits on </v>
<v Speaker 3>$1,000,000,000,000</v>

3076
02:15:40.621 --> 02:15:43.230
<v Speaker 3>in minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me that they're not there</v>

3077
02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:47.400
<v Speaker 3>partially for that or that someone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not looking at that as saying like,</v>

3078
02:15:47.401 --> 02:15:52.401
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we should figure out how to suck </v>

3079
02:15:52.401 --> 02:15:53.030
<v Speaker 3>those fucking minerals out of the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make a trillion dollars.</v>

3080
02:15:53.130 --> 02:15:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy the idea that that's not a </v>

3081
02:15:58.130 --> 02:16:01.641
<v Speaker 3>part of the equation is utter complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and I think that the amount of </v>

3082
02:16:02.911 --> 02:16:06.750
<v Speaker 3>minerals that are in these fucking car </v>
<v Speaker 3>batteries is something we really need to</v>

3083
02:16:06.751 --> 02:16:11.751
<v Speaker 3>look at because I was reading this whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece about conflict minerals and how </v>

3084
02:16:11.751 --> 02:16:15.180
<v Speaker 3>non-green electric cars actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you stop and look at it like.</v>

3085
02:16:15.181 --> 02:16:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as like our environment.</v>

3086
02:16:17.130 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3087
02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:21.810
<v Speaker 3>They definitely pollute our environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>

3088
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:25.920
<v Speaker 3>but if we look at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussions of creating these things,</v>

3089
02:16:25.921 --> 02:16:28.410
<v Speaker 3>like how are these minerals being </v>
<v Speaker 3>sourced?</v>

3090
02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.490
<v Speaker 3>How are they these batteries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3091
02:16:30.610 --> 02:16:35.610
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the adverse effects of creating </v>

3092
02:16:35.610 --> 02:16:35.610
<v Speaker 3>these batteries?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not clean and free.</v>

3093
02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 3>So people run around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drive my electric car and you know,</v>

3094
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:45.420
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only eat organic and so I'm free of </v>

3095
02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:45.420
<v Speaker 3>any</v>

3096
02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:47.160
<v Speaker 1>know you're free of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're free of your own,</v>

3097
02:16:47.161 --> 02:16:48.870
<v Speaker 1>your own bullshit gal because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3098
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:52.040
<v Speaker 3>But business being a fucking human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a human,</v>

3099
02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:54.260
<v Speaker 3>you're using things were consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3100
02:16:54.261 --> 02:16:56.360
<v Speaker 3>We should all consume less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most certainly,</v>

3101
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:59.810
<v Speaker 3>but like even people will only </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and grains,</v>

3102
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.000
<v Speaker 3>God damn large scale green operations </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy massive amounts of wildlife,</v>

3103
02:17:05.031 --> 02:17:07.130
<v Speaker 3>habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>displaced animals killed.</v>

3104
02:17:07.131 --> 02:17:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Those grain combines are completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminate.</v>

3105
02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:15.460
<v Speaker 3>They chew up rodents and fucking deer </v>
<v Speaker 3>fawns and ground nesting birds and </v>

3106
02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:16.340
<v Speaker 3>forget about insects.</v>

3107
02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Can you get me started on the bees</v>

3108
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:20.360
<v Speaker 3>bugs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just bugs alone.</v>

3109
02:17:20.361 --> 02:17:25.361
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we have a hierarchy of what we </v>

3110
02:17:25.361 --> 02:17:27.810
<v Speaker 3>will and won't allow being killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have these ideas well,</v>

3111
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:32.950
<v Speaker 3>well like animals exhibit fear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions and react to our environment so</v>

3112
02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:38.300
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But bees or insects like a mosquito.</v>

3113
02:17:38.301 --> 02:17:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a different thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's life but it's not</v>

3114
02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:46.470
<v Speaker 1>no fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like be the source of everything </v>

3115
02:17:46.470 --> 02:17:47.580
<v Speaker 1>but like mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes,</v>

3116
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:50.800
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes carry diseases and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>checked the.</v>

3117
02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mosquitoes make sure the population</v>

3118
02:17:53.791 --> 02:17:58.791
<v Speaker 1>stays low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but arguably like insects are probably </v>

3119
02:17:58.791 --> 02:18:02.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the best sources of protein that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could ever get stalled.</v>

3120
02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I felt like there was an insect protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement happening and it just sort of.</v>

3121
02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a perception issue because </v>

3122
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:11.440
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people have the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that one,</v>

3123
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.670
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Mexico recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they they serve crickets like the hotel </v>

3124
02:18:15.670 --> 02:18:15.840
<v Speaker 3>we were at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

3125
02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:18.560
<v Speaker 3>They have these like they look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're stir fried</v>

3126
02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:20.780
<v Speaker 1>crickets and they left him in our hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

3127
02:18:20.781 --> 02:18:22.880
<v Speaker 1>It was like a snack was covered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saran wrap.</v>

3128
02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but me,</v>

3129
02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:27.860
<v Speaker 1>of course I fucking fear factor you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

3130
02:18:27.890 --> 02:18:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It was literally eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've seen all that,</v>

3131
02:18:31.541 --> 02:18:36.541
<v Speaker 1>but they all ate them like regularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>there they were eating these because </v>

3132
02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:37.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like we'll eat snails lead frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

3133
02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there is a very weird line.</v>

3134
02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in our line is different than like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yulin dog festival line.</v>

3135
02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't we can talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

3136
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was in A.</v>

3137
02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Vietnam,</v>

3138
02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that they was like jellyfish </v>
<v Speaker 1>and squared,</v>

3139
02:18:52.251 --> 02:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what's available in that region.</v>

3140
02:18:55.011 --> 02:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3141
02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:58.590
<v Speaker 1>there was so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3142
02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:00.480
<v Speaker 1>we feel like a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a jellyfish,</v>

3143
02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:03.360
<v Speaker 1>willing to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just sucking jellyfish.</v>

3144
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I know</v>

3145
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:09.750
<v Speaker 3>bugs to me are really a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing because one of the things that we </v>

3146
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:11.170
<v Speaker 3>found out when we were doing fear factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that our ge,</v>

3147
02:19:11.171 --> 02:19:13.330
<v Speaker 3>so like if you have an allergy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain shellfish,</v>

3148
02:19:13.331 --> 02:19:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you also have an allergy to Roaches,</v>

3149
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3150
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:17.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3151
02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>we found that out the hard way lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bugs</v>

3152
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:28.270
<v Speaker 3>are an excellent source of protein and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't have the same emotional </v>

3153
02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:28.270
<v Speaker 3>attachment</v>

3154
02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:32.000
<v Speaker 1>to a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have a visceral negative reaction</v>

3155
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.890
<v Speaker 1>like repulsion to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3156
02:19:33.891 --> 02:19:38.891
<v Speaker 1>But if they did something but it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground up in some sort of a protein </v>

3157
02:19:38.891 --> 02:19:40.510
<v Speaker 1>peddling cricket protein is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've ever cricket bar now?</v>

3158
02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Protein bars are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3159
02:19:41.571 --> 02:19:42.590
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3160
02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Expo crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future of protein,</v>

3161
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>soy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dairy,</v>

3162
02:19:45.861 --> 02:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>grain and gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleo and environmentally friendly.</v>

3163
02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat the shit out of some crickets.</v>

3164
02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Do they taste like anything bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just tastes like soy protein or </v>

3165
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:57.800
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're eating lobster,</v>

3166
02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're eating shit.</v>

3167
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Cricket bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're eating lobster,</v>

3168
02:20:08.930 --> 02:20:11.630
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're eating shit because</v>

3169
02:20:11.631 --> 02:20:16.631
<v Speaker 1>there's the ultimate debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are like </v>

3170
02:20:16.631 --> 02:20:20.230
<v Speaker 1>really strict vegetarians and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not eating vegan because they want to </v>

3171
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:21.680
<v Speaker 1>leave the least amount of footprint </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

3172
02:20:21.681 --> 02:20:26.681
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder how they would feel about </v>

3173
02:20:26.681 --> 02:20:29.320
<v Speaker 1>crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how they feel about perception </v>

3174
02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:29.320
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3175
02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

3176
02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:35.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We perceived dogs to be cute and Catia </v>

3177
02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we perceived crickets to be like</v>

3178
02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:38.860
<v Speaker 1>gross and dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

3179
02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:44.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's there and they're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When would you be willing to eat a bug?</v>

3180
02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're not willing to eat like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

3181
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:50.640
<v Speaker 1>would you be willing to eat a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3182
02:20:50.670 --> 02:20:52.880
<v Speaker 1>gets a live bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dead bug.</v>

3183
02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Like someone like maybe someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian and they do it for ethical </v>

3184
02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.170
<v Speaker 1>reasons or they have a concern about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being about bugs.</v>

3185
02:21:00.170 --> 02:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a lot of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like I'm eating just a little </v>

3186
02:21:05.170 --> 02:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's eating a scale.</v>

3187
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm meeting a skeleton and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a meat that I can sort of </v>

3188
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:11.280
<v Speaker 1>disassociate from their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up skeleton.</v>

3189
02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:14.330
<v Speaker 1>When you grind that shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually pretty high in protein.</v>

3190
02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:15.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>

3191
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3192
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something just kind of Ooh,</v>

3193
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:22.520
<v Speaker 1>ugly about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that we're.</v>

3194
02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to bring this back to the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying.</v>

3195
02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:29.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that were designed to squirm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs because everyone's squirms at bugs </v>

3196
02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:33.350
<v Speaker 1>because I think they carry diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poison and more than diseases,</v>

3197
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:38.830
<v Speaker 1>so we're evolved to go to bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has probably saved a lot of our </v>

3198
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:42.101
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that we're not running around </v>

3199
02:21:42.101 --> 02:21:42.260
<v Speaker 1>eating them since there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than lyme disease and malaria.</v>

3200
02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Malaria is a giant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3201
02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>What else does carry what other diseases</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are allergic to bees?</v>

3202
02:21:49.341 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Wass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3203
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's spiders,</v>

3204
02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:55.430
<v Speaker 1>black widow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders or those are poisons.</v>

3205
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

3206
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Seizes lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big one.</v>

3207
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Malaria's the biggest malaria has killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuckload of people.</v>

3208
02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy's got malaria right now </v>

3209
02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:08.460
<v Speaker 1>for the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CICA and should not seek out.</v>

3210
02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:09.890
<v Speaker 1>What was the one before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the one who.</v>

3211
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:11.530
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say Zika?</v>

3212
02:22:11.531 --> 02:22:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Is it whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched.</v>

3213
02:22:13.930 --> 02:22:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I saw it on Fox News so I wouldn't go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico because of it.</v>

3214
02:22:17.930 --> 02:22:19.220
<v Speaker 1>But they're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

3215
02:22:19.221 --> 02:22:20.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the other one that was before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3216
02:22:20.481 --> 02:22:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Not Anthrax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just tap.</v>

3217
02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Ebola was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was that.</v>

3218
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>That's from spit isn't a</v>

3219
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 5>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody fucked a monkey.</v>

3220
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 5>Someone to talk to her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3221
02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Monkeys.</v>

3222
02:22:29.890 --> 02:22:32.130
<v Speaker 5>Diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The diseases that come from bugs.</v>

3223
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of foot and mouth or </v>

02:22:37.341 --> 02:22:42.120
<v Speaker 5>what's I'm a look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaga is disease and look at the vector.</v>

3225
02:22:42.121 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Various assassin bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fever,</v>

3226
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 5>lung,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heart or mucus membranes.</v>

3227
02:22:47.941 --> 02:22:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck's in assassin?</v>

3228
02:22:49.921 --> 02:22:54.921
<v Speaker 5>Bug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever heard of a mild symptoms </v>

3229
02:22:56.971 --> 02:23:00.880
<v Speaker 5>and chronic heart or brain inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

3230
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.280
<v Speaker 5>Mild relative of the Ninja bug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3231
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Plague the flea is subfamily of a try.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A total fucking assholes.</v>

3232
02:23:14.970 --> 02:23:17.250
<v Speaker 5>Assholes do not give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3233
02:23:17.251 --> 02:23:19.010
<v Speaker 5>they're the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3234
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:24.890
<v Speaker 5>biggest argument for decreasing deer </v>
<v Speaker 5>population and also intrigued </v>

3235
02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:26.700
<v Speaker 5>reintroduction of predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the summer areas,</v>

3236
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:31.910
<v Speaker 5>like some people are talking about like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing in a coyotes and wolves in a </v>

3237
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:35.301
<v Speaker 5>certain area like saved yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The reintroduction of wolves didn't </v>

3238
02:23:35.301 --> 02:23:35.650
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3239
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 5>that's a very controversial subject.</v>

3240
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 5>The shape of the river,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy that said that,</v>

3241
02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:47.160
<v Speaker 5>that guy who made those amazing videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wolves changed the course of that </v>

3242
02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:47.950
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>George to build,</v>

3243
02:23:47.970 --> 02:23:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I think his name is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget how to say his last name.</v>

3244
02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:52.980
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really in a good way,</v>

3245
02:23:52.981 --> 02:23:57.390
<v Speaker 5>but it's like when I found out the coney</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy was like a pedophile.</v>

3246
02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 5>That crazy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy.</v>

3247
02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:05.430
<v Speaker 5>He was super depressed and was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicidal I guess,</v>

3248
02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:10.320
<v Speaker 5>and was was in his midlife and was </v>
<v Speaker 5>wondering what's the purpose of life?</v>

3249
02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.470
<v Speaker 5>And got fascinated by the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 5>rewilding.</v>

3250
02:24:14.250 --> 02:24:17.400
<v Speaker 5>He got fascinated by this reintroduction</v>
<v Speaker 5>of predators,</v>

3251
02:24:17.401 --> 02:24:19.650
<v Speaker 5>keystone predators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to areas like yellowstone,</v>

3252
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:24.680
<v Speaker 5>which they definitely have their purpose</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're definitely important to the </v>

3253
02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.120
<v Speaker 5>health of the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3254
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:31.510
<v Speaker 5>the weaker of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with things like wolves is </v>

3255
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:35.720
<v Speaker 5>they can get overpopulated as well and </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone needs to manage them and that's </v>

3256
02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.180
<v Speaker 5>where things get weird.</v>

3257
02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.610
<v Speaker 5>So wildlife biologists have established </v>
<v Speaker 5>these guidelines when biologists,</v>

3258
02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 5>but for humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so who nobody was chaos.</v>

3259
02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3260
02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:48.570
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot of different animals </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

3261
02:24:48.571 --> 02:24:51.570
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years prior.</v>

3262
02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:55.470
<v Speaker 5>There was all these different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals like the short face bear,</v>

3263
02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:58.380
<v Speaker 5>short nose or short face bear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was an enormous bare.</v>

3264
02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:03.500
<v Speaker 5>There was a step lion that existed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>America like a long time ago that was </v>

3265
02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:08.391
<v Speaker 5>way bigger than the African lion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was all these birds and fucking </v>

3266
02:25:08.391 --> 02:25:09.630
<v Speaker 5>crazy predators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terror birds.</v>

3267
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:10.800
<v Speaker 5>So we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll go back.</v>

3268
02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:14.370
<v Speaker 5>Thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even like millions,</v>

3269
02:25:14.371 --> 02:25:19.371
<v Speaker 5>like when the when bulls first and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of different kinds of </v>

3270
02:25:19.371 --> 02:25:20.040
<v Speaker 5>wolves and some wolves like the gray </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves.</v>

3271
02:25:20.041 --> 02:25:25.041
<v Speaker 5>They left and left North America and </v>
<v Speaker 5>migrated across the bering strait and </v>

3272
02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:27.030
<v Speaker 5>then the red wolves and some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other wolf stayed.</v>

3273
02:25:27.090 --> 02:25:32.090
<v Speaker 5>That's why those wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the ones that interbreed with </v>

3274
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:35.761
<v Speaker 5>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but coyotes is actually a wolf or a </v>

3275
02:25:35.761 --> 02:25:36.160
<v Speaker 5>coyote is a kind of wolf or coyote is </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's called.</v>

3276
02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:38.560
<v Speaker 5>They used to call them prairie wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3277
02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:43.570
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a guy name Dan Flores who has </v>

3278
02:25:43.931 --> 02:25:48.931
<v Speaker 5>this amazing paper that he wrote called </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bison Ecology and bison diplomacy and </v>

3279
02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:54.841
<v Speaker 5>I'm really groundbreaking paper on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bisons and livestock and the wild </v>

3280
02:25:56.261 --> 02:26:01.261
<v Speaker 5>animals rather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that live in North America and lived in </v>

3281
02:26:01.261 --> 02:26:01.960
<v Speaker 5>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he wrote this new book on coyotes,</v>

3282
02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:05.440
<v Speaker 5>coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just what the planes used to be like</v>

3283
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.210
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why this George Guy,</v>

3284
02:26:07.211 --> 02:26:09.230
<v Speaker 5>this antibiotic guide or say his name </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

3285
02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:10.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wolves change rivers.</v>

3286
02:26:10.691 --> 02:26:15.691
<v Speaker 5>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wants to reintroduce megafauna to </v>

3287
02:26:15.691 --> 02:26:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Europe like lions because he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that at one point in time,</v>

3288
02:26:17.801 --> 02:26:22.801
<v Speaker 5>lions and hyenas used to live in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that we could use these are large </v>

3289
02:26:22.801 --> 02:26:26.941
<v Speaker 5>segments of unused land and let these </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals loose and reintroduce them to </v>

3290
02:26:26.941 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 5>this area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's out of his fucking mind.</v>

3291
02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:30.360
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like a horrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3292
02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:30.940
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3293
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:36.240
<v Speaker 5>it's engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he doesn't want to just take an </v>

3294
02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:37.870
<v Speaker 5>animal that was extra painted because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>human intervention.</v>

3295
02:26:38.050 --> 02:26:41.110
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolves were taken out of the wolves were</v>

3296
02:26:41.111 --> 02:26:41.850
<v Speaker 5>poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3297
02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.870
<v Speaker 5>this is what they used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These to take a carcass.</v>

3298
02:26:43.871 --> 02:26:48.070
<v Speaker 5>They would shoot a buffalo and while the</v>
<v Speaker 5>animal is still like barely alive,</v>

3299
02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.040
<v Speaker 5>they would inject strychnine into it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3300
02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:56.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's arteries and that way it would the </v>

3301
02:26:56.130 --> 02:26:58.950
<v Speaker 5>poison we get through all of the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they would take a wolf that they </v>

3302
02:26:58.950 --> 02:27:02.671
<v Speaker 5>shot and they would rub it set all over </v>
<v Speaker 5>this carcass so that the wolves knew </v>

3303
02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:05.080
<v Speaker 5>that other wolves had been there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was safe.</v>

3304
02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:08.440
<v Speaker 5>They knew it was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a dead carcass.</v>

3305
02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:12.160
<v Speaker 5>So they would eat it and they would kill</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and they almost extinguished.</v>

3306
02:27:12.161 --> 02:27:15.970
<v Speaker 5>Wolves almost like came really close to </v>
<v Speaker 5>extinction wolves in North America.</v>

3307
02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:21.330
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't do that with the coyote </v>
<v Speaker 5>though the coyotes are too fucking </v>

3308
02:27:21.330 --> 02:27:21.760
<v Speaker 5>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're too clever because clever.</v>

3309
02:27:21.790 --> 02:27:23.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because of wolves.</v>

3310
02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:26.980
<v Speaker 5>It's because the gray wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they returned to North America,</v>

3311
02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:32.100
<v Speaker 5>they were killing coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the red wolves were interbreeding </v>

3312
02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:32.290
<v Speaker 5>with coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the gray wolves were killing them.</v>

3313
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:35.380
<v Speaker 5>So the coyote learned to adapt to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>gray wolves.</v>

3314
02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.930
<v Speaker 5>So they learned to move to the furthest </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas.</v>

3315
02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:39.780
<v Speaker 5>They also want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hear coyotes yelling.</v>

3316
02:27:40.130 --> 02:27:42.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're doing a roll call the trinity.</v>

3317
02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:45.460
<v Speaker 5>And when they find out that someone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>missing,</v>

3318
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:47.830
<v Speaker 5>it triggers the females to have larger </v>
<v Speaker 5>litters.</v>

3319
02:27:48.470 --> 02:27:49.660
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.900
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3321
02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.740
<v Speaker 5>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to send you this podcast,</v>

3322
02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:55.920
<v Speaker 5>this podcast with Dan Flores.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to blow your.</v>

3323
02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.990
<v Speaker 4>I hate coyotes burrowing in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have dogs.</v>

3324
02:27:58.991 --> 02:27:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had,</v>

3325
02:27:59.501 --> 02:28:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had dens they made dens in,</v>

3326
02:28:03.091 --> 02:28:08.091
<v Speaker 4>in the back of my yard because I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>like land and then I have this part up </v>

3327
02:28:08.091 --> 02:28:10.831
<v Speaker 4>top that don't really go up that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my dog used to just come back with </v>

3328
02:28:10.831 --> 02:28:11.470
<v Speaker 4>fucking like half plate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3329
02:28:11.471 --> 02:28:14.800
<v Speaker 4>what is going on up there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what she did,</v>

3330
02:28:14.801 --> 02:28:17.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that she's up to now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3331
02:28:17.231 --> 02:28:18.550
<v Speaker 4>one's even bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one's a pit bull.</v>

3332
02:28:18.551 --> 02:28:22.210
<v Speaker 4>I think what she did was she would chase</v>
<v Speaker 4>one and then it will go under</v>

3333
02:28:22.210 --> 02:28:23.510
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you realize the vampire they can</v>

3334
02:28:23.511 --> 02:28:24.830
<v Speaker 2>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can,</v>

3335
02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they can clear Julie's to get a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence in your yard.</v>

3336
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:30.650
<v Speaker 2>It has to go three feet into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>in seven feet tall.</v>

3337
02:28:30.651 --> 02:28:31.920
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can jump.</v>

3338
02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually stole my chicken and I want </v>

3339
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.370
<v Speaker 5>you to jump over the fence with chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>and rice.</v>

3340
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:40.160
<v Speaker 2>The coyote stole a baby and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona off of the porch.</v>

3341
02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking barbarians.</v>

3342
02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:46.110
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the by two encounters one time I,</v>

3343
02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:51.160
<v Speaker 2>they were drinking out of my pool and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>came outside and I literally opened the </v>

3344
02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:51.160
<v Speaker 2>door and they just looked at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3345
02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to chase them.</v>

3346
02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw one jump over my fence.</v>

3347
02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be five and six feet tall.</v>

3348
02:28:58.041 --> 02:28:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's totally boring.</v>

3349
02:28:59.450 --> 02:29:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And I literally said cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking Wiley Coyote.</v>

3350
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

3351
02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:08.261
<v Speaker 2>I gotta call animal control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna have this fucking dead broken </v>

3352
02:29:08.261 --> 02:29:08.261
<v Speaker 2>coyote on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go in the other side,</v>

3353
02:29:08.261 --> 02:29:09.170
<v Speaker 2>it's just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flew off.</v>

3354
02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were explaining to me.</v>

3355
02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3356
02:29:11.541 --> 02:29:12.380
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a coyote,</v>

3357
02:29:12.381 --> 02:29:13.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3358
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:14.750
<v Speaker 2>killing my dog.</v>

3359
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll be able to hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3360
02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll just leave the door open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3361
02:29:16.791 --> 02:29:17.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3362
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand.</v>

3363
02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Coyote is work because they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>cunning.</v>

3364
02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:25.300
<v Speaker 2>The way that they kill a larger animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they befriend it first so it'll play </v>

3365
02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:29.600
<v Speaker 2>with your dog for 45 minutes and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other five will descend around it so</v>

3366
02:29:29.601 --> 02:29:34.601
<v Speaker 2>it ingratiates it knows I need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingratiate myself with you first and </v>

3367
02:29:34.601 --> 02:29:38.771
<v Speaker 2>then kill you and they tire them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this happens a lot in runyon canyon.</v>

3368
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:43.961
<v Speaker 2>People's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just see him chasing the coyote </v>

3369
02:29:43.961 --> 02:29:46.091
<v Speaker 2>and then the coyotes will just run and </v>
<v Speaker 2>run and run until the dog is tired and </v>

3370
02:29:46.091 --> 02:29:47.600
<v Speaker 2>then everyone will descend there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hungry and they're desperate and</v>

3371
02:29:47.601 --> 02:29:50.040
<v Speaker 2>there do not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine up,</v>

3372
02:29:50.100 --> 02:29:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Heaney was walking his dog like a small </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog and a saw a coyote face to face and </v>

3373
02:29:55.881 --> 02:29:59.710
<v Speaker 2>picked up his dog and the like had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like flex on it to get it to run away.</v>

3374
02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Started walking again back to his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like 20 feet from his house.</v>

3375
02:30:03.081 --> 02:30:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The coyote had come back with four other</v>

3376
02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:10.340
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are just fearless and they live </v>

3377
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:13.230
<v Speaker 2>amongst us a little fucking monsters </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

3378
02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have like compassion for them.</v>

3379
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:18.110
<v Speaker 2>If it's between my dog and a coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

3380
02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill a coyote with my hands.</v>

3381
02:30:20.931 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really sad when you're like,</v>

3382
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:23.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3383
02:30:23.121 --> 02:30:25.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry this was your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

3384
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:27.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never been really.</v>

3385
02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:31.030
<v Speaker 5>It's just constant domination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rats didn't own it.</v>

3386
02:30:31.031 --> 02:30:32.830
<v Speaker 5>They're killing rats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Rats House,</v>

3387
02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:34.420
<v Speaker 5>the code is a killing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The rafts are stealing.</v>

3388
02:30:34.430 --> 02:30:36.880
<v Speaker 5>The rest of was trying to convince me </v>
<v Speaker 5>that rats are really smart.</v>

3389
02:30:36.970 --> 02:30:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Rats are pretty smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but coyotes eat them.</v>

3390
02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:41.560
<v Speaker 5>If we didn't have coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would have way more.</v>

3391
02:30:41.561 --> 02:30:46.561
<v Speaker 5>Rats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would have a huge rodent problem all </v>

3392
02:30:46.561 --> 02:30:46.561
<v Speaker 5>throughout Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rods in my pool all the time.</v>

3393
02:30:46.561 --> 02:30:51.480
<v Speaker 5>My daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a balance that has to be </v>

3394
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:51.480
<v Speaker 5>achieved and that's why wolves are </v>
<v Speaker 5>really important.</v>

3395
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:56.341
<v Speaker 5>Like the people that think that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should re extra pate wolves and wiped </v>

3396
02:30:56.341 --> 02:30:56.341
<v Speaker 5>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not.</v>

3397
02:30:56.341 --> 02:30:58.560
<v Speaker 5>But if you look at some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have happened,</v>

3398
02:30:59.530 --> 02:31:01.570
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gray wolves do gray wolf,</v>

3399
02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:03.640
<v Speaker 5>gray wolves don't interbreed with </v>
<v Speaker 5>coyotes,</v>

3400
02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:06.610
<v Speaker 5>but red wolves do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So gray wolves killed coyotes.</v>

3401
02:31:06.611 --> 02:31:11.611
<v Speaker 5>So where they've reintroduced wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another interesting thing about </v>

3402
02:31:11.611 --> 02:31:12.550
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone that you reintroduced the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves to yellowstone.</v>

3403
02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:17.550
<v Speaker 5>They dropped the coyote population down </v>
<v Speaker 5>50 percent because the gray wolves were </v>

3404
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:19.110
<v Speaker 5>killing the coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because when you kill coyotes and do</v>

3405
02:31:19.111 --> 02:31:21.420
<v Speaker 5>the roll call thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the females are larger letters.</v>

3406
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:26.630
<v Speaker 5>They rebounded and now are more coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 5>in yellowstone than were before they </v>

3407
02:31:27.661 --> 02:31:31.210
<v Speaker 5>reintroduced the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so fucking adapted.</v>

3408
02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:32.310
<v Speaker 5>Their amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3409
02:31:32.311 --> 02:31:36.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean I also just love that dogs were </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves wants and just they just.</v>

3410
02:31:36.271 --> 02:31:41.271
<v Speaker 5>Some coyotes survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Survival is can still breed with dogs </v>

3411
02:31:41.271 --> 02:31:41.271
<v Speaker 5>just like wolves can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3412
02:31:41.271 --> 02:31:42.510
<v Speaker 5>It's just survival of the friendliest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They realized like,</v>

3413
02:31:42.511 --> 02:31:47.511
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then so wolves evolved to be dogs </v>

3414
02:31:47.511 --> 02:31:50.990
<v Speaker 5>and then realized to protect us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could survive and now they protect </v>

3415
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:50.990
<v Speaker 5>us against wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:54.060
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck did that ever happen to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3417
02:31:54.061 --> 02:31:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Neil degrasse Tyson did his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his cosmos.</v>

3418
02:31:56.251 --> 02:31:59.040
<v Speaker 5>He did that thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was kind of short but sorta.</v>

3419
02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.190
<v Speaker 5>But you still like God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:03.300
<v Speaker 5>How did it become a poodle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3421
02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did the Afro,</v>

3422
02:32:05.971 --> 02:32:08.020
<v Speaker 5>like how was it was like a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>mutation.</v>

3423
02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:13.040
<v Speaker 5>Then we really latched onto,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I think it's also the cutest ones </v>

3424
02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:13.040
<v Speaker 5>are the ones that survived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3425
02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:13.920
<v Speaker 5>because they're the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3426
02:32:13.921 --> 02:32:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Cute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sweet.</v>

3427
02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:17.880
<v Speaker 5>And the ugly ones are the ones that got </v>
<v Speaker 5>weeded out.</v>

3428
02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:23.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the balance that this George </v>

3429
02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:23.070
<v Speaker 5>Monbiot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's how you say his name,</v>

3430
02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 5>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his take on wolves,</v>

3431
02:32:26.911 --> 02:32:31.911
<v Speaker 5>turning like the people love that video </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's English and he's got a </v>

3432
02:32:31.911 --> 02:32:33.690
<v Speaker 5>beautiful voice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating story.</v>

3433
02:32:33.691 --> 02:32:35.140
<v Speaker 5>And it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3434
02:32:35.610 --> 02:32:37.410
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a lot of truth to what he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

3435
02:32:37.650 --> 02:32:42.650
<v Speaker 5>Like it's important to have keystone </v>
<v Speaker 5>predators because they keep the </v>

3436
02:32:42.650 --> 02:32:43.840
<v Speaker 5>populations of these game animals or you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3437
02:32:43.850 --> 02:32:48.850
<v Speaker 5>like wild undulates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the keep them healthy because they </v>

3438
02:32:48.850 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 5>control them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when wolves get to populated,</v>

3439
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:53.940
<v Speaker 5>they get crazy and they do what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>call surplus killing.</v>

3440
02:32:54.130 --> 02:32:59.130
<v Speaker 5>Like they killed 19 elk recently in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wyoming and they didn't need any of </v>

3441
02:32:59.130 --> 02:33:02.811
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just went on this butchering ron </v>

3442
02:33:02.811 --> 02:33:02.811
<v Speaker 5>and just kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

3443
02:33:02.811 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They come over the top of a hill and </v>

3444
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:06.060
<v Speaker 5>they see a herd of elk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you?</v>

3445
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen a herd of elk are </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

3446
02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:08.460
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes a herd of elk,</v>

3447
02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.400
<v Speaker 5>maybe a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 strong and it's amazing.</v>

3448
02:33:11.401 --> 02:33:16.401
<v Speaker 5>You'll come over a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've only seen maybe 30 of them </v>

3449
02:33:16.401 --> 02:33:17.340
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's quite a sight.</v>

3450
02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:22.400
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're just fucking 30 of them </v>

3451
02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:22.400
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we were,</v>

3452
02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:24.480
<v Speaker 5>we came over the top of this hill and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>

3453
02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

3454
02:33:24.961 --> 02:33:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at.</v>

3455
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:29.910
<v Speaker 5>And then she's heard of my old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3456
02:33:29.911 --> 02:33:34.480
<v Speaker 5>500 to a thousand pound forest cows that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are wandering it.</v>

3457
02:33:34.481 --> 02:33:34.920
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a</v>

3458
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:40.610
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw Moose in Jackson Hall and I was </v>

3459
02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:41.760
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's rare because those are all bowls.</v>

3460
02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:45.810
<v Speaker 4>Female smells around amongst them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wolves.</v>

3461
02:33:45.930 --> 02:33:47.700
<v Speaker 4>I saw Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moose,</v>

3462
02:33:47.730 --> 02:33:49.410
<v Speaker 4>and the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy that was.</v>

3463
02:33:49.411 --> 02:33:51.300
<v Speaker 4>We were doing a little thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>skull.</v>

3464
02:33:51.301 --> 02:33:52.650
<v Speaker 4>The Snake River,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3465
02:33:52.651 --> 02:33:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Jackson hole was explaining how most cal</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears.</v>

3466
02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 4>You kick them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucked up.</v>

3467
02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:02.010
<v Speaker 4>I think he said there was a video </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere of it.</v>

3468
02:34:02.011 --> 02:34:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3469
02:34:02.371 --> 02:34:07.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm too terrified to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they wait because they obviously </v>

3470
02:34:07.371 --> 02:34:08.490
<v Speaker 4>can't fight the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wait till the bears.</v>

3471
02:34:08.491 --> 02:34:10.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Running up on them and they just wait,</v>

3472
02:34:10.201 --> 02:34:10.730
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

3473
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:15.740
<v Speaker 4>don't get the last minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just basically knock their head off </v>

3474
02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:15.740
<v Speaker 4>their bodies.</v>

3475
02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Fifteen percent of all wolves that die </v>
<v Speaker 5>get killed by.</v>

3476
02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

3477
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:19.060
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the mortality rate of wolves.</v>

3479
02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give a fuck.</v>

3480
02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:27.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how big.</v>

3481
02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're just like tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3482
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:33.790
<v Speaker 1>They're fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're huge.</v>

3483
02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>

3484
02:34:34.481 --> 02:34:39.481
<v Speaker 1>what is the first time I saw one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were hunting them in BC and we saw </v>

3485
02:34:39.481 --> 02:34:40.810
<v Speaker 1>this female and it was like that seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>drastic park.</v>

3486
02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:43.420
<v Speaker 1>When Jeff Goldbloom sees the dynamo sore</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>

3487
02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:49.140
<v Speaker 1>we were like maybe like five or 600 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards away from them and we opened up </v>

3488
02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:51.460
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked outside and there were huge</v>

3489
02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:54.050
<v Speaker 3>wandering through this field and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3490
02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:59.080
<v Speaker 3>they're living in a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark place where we found one that had </v>

3491
02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.321
<v Speaker 3>been killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a calf that had been killed by wolves </v>

3492
02:35:02.321 --> 02:35:02.321
<v Speaker 3>and it would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been killed hours earlier.</v>

3493
02:35:02.321 --> 02:35:04.550
<v Speaker 3>It was fairly fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a crazy scene.</v>

3494
02:35:04.551 --> 02:35:09.551
<v Speaker 3>I put it up on instagram and it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange scene because there's this </v>

3495
02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:09.551
<v Speaker 3>carcass,</v>

3496
02:35:09.551 --> 02:35:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but there's hair everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere.</v>

3497
02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:15.990
<v Speaker 1>They just show the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find it.</v>

3498
02:35:16.050 --> 02:35:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Jamie was like a probably a year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's old instagram picture,</v>

3499
02:35:20.130 --> 02:35:25.130
<v Speaker 3>but the picture was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was when we got there because we saw </v>

3500
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.250
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3501
02:35:25.350 --> 02:35:27.330
<v Speaker 3>these crows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some circling.</v>

3502
02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It was all crows and there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>squawking and we walked up on it and we </v>

3503
02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:36.231
<v Speaker 3>found this thing just devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's so eerie to think that there's </v>

3504
02:35:36.231 --> 02:35:40.521
<v Speaker 3>these wild roaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat Canadian wolves are just wild as </v>

3505
02:35:40.521 --> 02:35:40.521
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've never been extricated.</v>

3506
02:35:40.521 --> 02:35:45.520
<v Speaker 3>They've always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the same rules that they </v>

3507
02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:46.860
<v Speaker 3>brought into yellowstone were actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian walls that gray North American,</v>

3508
02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States gray walls were actually </v>

3509
02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:51.920
<v Speaker 3>smaller than the ones they brought from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

3510
02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Because mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when mammals come from colder climates,</v>

3511
02:35:55.260 --> 02:35:58.590
<v Speaker 3>they have larger bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why move somewhere away.</v>

3512
02:35:58.740 --> 02:35:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3513
02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:03.630
<v Speaker 1>this is a bare fucking gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

3514
02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>As barbwire on the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing climbed at 12 foot high.</v>

3515
02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:10.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how it did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come to 12 foot high fence.</v>

3519

<v Speaker 1>That thing should be in the fucking zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that how you got out?</v>

<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3541
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.750
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

3542
02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:22.840
<v Speaker 4>before the fake poisoning of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm conflating it with something </v>

3543
02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.741
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was probably other ones who have </v>

3544
02:37:26.741 --> 02:37:26.741
<v Speaker 4>been poisoned or something cause they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were saying,</v>

3545
02:37:26.741 --> 02:37:30.020
<v Speaker 4>stop putting poison out on your lawn </v>
<v Speaker 4>because fucking kill monsters.</v>

3546
02:37:30.021 --> 02:37:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're your into Kelly's awesome.</v>

3547
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:34.960
<v Speaker 4>A broken murderers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3548
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:36.200
<v Speaker 4>is that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3549
02:37:36.201 --> 02:37:41.201
<v Speaker 4>So a friend of mine was hiking in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Griffith Park and her dog came back </v>

3550
02:37:41.201 --> 02:37:42.400
<v Speaker 4>covered in like innards of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like deer enter.</v>

3551
02:37:42.401 --> 02:37:43.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3552
02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean like literally had like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in trails up all,</v>

3553
02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:52.300
<v Speaker 4>like wrapped around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The nose and the mountain lion had </v>

3554
02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 4>killed deer and the dog roll around in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3555
02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:56.360
<v Speaker 4>Why does a dog roll around in a dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal?</v>

3556
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:58.010
<v Speaker 4>They always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are fun.</v>

3557
02:37:58.011 --> 02:38:01.220
<v Speaker 4>A dead squirrel in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the scent on it.</v>

3558
02:38:01.690 --> 02:38:06.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really sure because it actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes me think it would make another </v>

3559
02:38:06.690 --> 02:38:08.320
<v Speaker 4>animal one to attack you if you smell </v>
<v Speaker 4>like blood and in or it's.</v>

3560
02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:11.330

<v Speaker 4>But I do know my dog.</v>

3561
02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:16.360
<v Speaker 4>Another dead body is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same outline.</v>

3562
02:38:16.881 --> 02:38:19.480
<v Speaker 4>It's got poisoned but it didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3563
02:38:19.490 --> 02:38:20.530

02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.260
<v Speaker 5>cat for California's rat poison problem.</v>

3566
02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:25.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's two options.</v>

3567
02:38:25.501 --> 02:38:29.190
<v Speaker 5>You poisoned the rats or you invite more</v>
<v Speaker 5>coyotes to lived near your house.</v>

3568
02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:31.410
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say when they eat dog cats.</v>

3569
02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:33.150
<v Speaker 5>Tony too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also in the damn floor.</v>

3570
02:38:33.151 --> 02:38:35.430
<v Speaker 5>His podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He talks about how when they eat dogs,</v>

3571
02:38:35.431 --> 02:38:39.720
<v Speaker 5>they're not really eating dogs because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to eat them for like a meal as</v>

3572
02:38:39.721 --> 02:38:41.760
<v Speaker 5>much as they want to eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 5>predators,</v>

3573
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:47.240
<v Speaker 5>like competing predators,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with cats because most of </v>

3574
02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:48.540
<v Speaker 5>what they eat like a coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Z,</v>

3575
02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:51.060
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of bugs that eat a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>grasshoppers.</v>

3576
02:38:51.061 --> 02:38:53.130
<v Speaker 5>They eat a lot of rats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They ate a lot of rodents,</v>

3577
02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:55.180
<v Speaker 5>rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they.</v>

3578
02:38:55.270 --> 02:39:00.270
<v Speaker 5>The cat's compete with them because cats</v>
<v Speaker 5>are a fucking murderers and now.</v>

3579

<v Speaker 5>underneath his body.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We called this kitty like my cows named </v>
<v Speaker 5>kitty.</v>

3596
02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.810

<v Speaker 5>Like we had a name for my name to him,</v>

3597
02:40:03.811 --> 02:40:08.811
<v Speaker 5>like Conan the barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The comic books had like a lion that he </v>

<v Speaker 4>because remember she like raised lions </v>

3606
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:30.630
<v Speaker 4>and Melanie Griffith grew up with lions </v>

<v Speaker 4>That was a mistake.</v>

3611
02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.800
<v Speaker 4>It was super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of them I think cut up Melania </v>

3612
02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Griffin had to have surgery on it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of them bought her like,</v>

3613
02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:50.300
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she grew up with these things in her </v>

<v Speaker 4>That's Tippi hedren her mom.</v>

3616
02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:50.650

<v Speaker 4>she had tons of them here.</v>

3619
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep going.</v>

3620
02:40:57.271 --> 02:41:02.271

<v Speaker 4>So how do they do that and not get </v>

3621
02:41:02.271 --> 02:41:02.271
<v Speaker 4>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These motherfuckers will,</v>

3622
02:41:02.271 --> 02:41:04.170
<v Speaker 4>you have to raise them from infancy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at their.</v>

3623
02:41:04.171 --> 02:41:08.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have tiger because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the pack or like a pride.</v>

3624
02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:13.131
<v Speaker 4>I guess it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if they just decided to play </v>

3625
02:41:13.131 --> 02:41:13.260
<v Speaker 4>with any moment at any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at any moment?</v>

3626
02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Look on the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could.</v>

3627
02:41:16.261 --> 02:41:21.261
<v Speaker 4>And they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they try to make a movie out of it </v>

3628
02:41:21.261 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 4>and one of the cameramen got his face </v>
<v Speaker 4>ripped off and they were like,</v>

3629
02:41:22.081 --> 02:41:24.190
<v Speaker 4>nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anxiety.</v>

3630
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.150
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know that there sociopathic.</v>

3631
02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I think if he's not social</v>

3632
02:41:28.580 --> 02:41:30.110
<v Speaker 3>pathic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just natural.</v>

3633
02:41:30.111 --> 02:41:34.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all of these reward mechanisms</v>

3634
02:41:34.611 --> 02:41:39.611
<v Speaker 3>that are built into their DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel good when they chase after </v>

3635
02:41:39.611 --> 02:41:40.420
<v Speaker 3>things and kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to hunt.</v>

3636
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:43.370
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the problem with zoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it these things?</v>

3637
02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like extracting a guys come through</v>

<v Speaker 4>Part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

02:42:04.211 --> 02:42:09.211
<v Speaker 4>I'm really don't endorse doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did she get rid of the lions when </v>

3650
02:42:09.211 --> 02:42:09.640
<v Speaker 4>she still has them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

3651
02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to organize going to her </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she has like a sanctuary and she</v>

3652
02:42:15.031 --> 02:42:20.031
<v Speaker 4>tries to raise money to save lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because you know now like an </v>

3653
02:42:20.031 --> 02:42:22.451
<v Speaker 4>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more animals in captivity than </v>

3654
02:42:22.451 --> 02:42:22.451
<v Speaker 4>they are on the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's such a problem.</v>

3655
02:42:22.451 --> 02:42:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

3656
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:28.190
<v Speaker 3>But that captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about high fence </v>

3657
02:42:28.190 --> 02:42:29.350
<v Speaker 3>operations that are sometimes a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand plus acres.</v>

3658
02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:29.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many,</v>

3659
02:42:29.921 --> 02:42:30.850
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many square miles.</v>

3660
02:42:30.851 --> 02:42:35.851
<v Speaker 3>So you look at the actual range that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned would inhabit and oftentimes </v>

3661
02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:40.980
<v Speaker 3>it's much smaller than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling like a pejorative way.</v>

3662
02:42:41.351 --> 02:42:43.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3663
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:44.980
<v Speaker 3>they're fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3664
02:42:45.430 --> 02:42:48.460
<v Speaker 3>One of the fucking crazy catch 22 is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Africa.</v>

3665
02:42:48.610 --> 02:42:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Is that Lou?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

3666
02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Louis through documentary and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to him on your show.</v>

3667
02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch his documentary on African</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunter?</v>

3668
02:42:56.380 --> 02:43:00.670
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But many of the animals that people hunt</v>

3669
02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:05.700
<v Speaker 3>in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're very close to extinction just a </v>

3670
02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:10.800
<v Speaker 3>few decades ago when they put value on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they set up these hunting </v>

3671
02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:14.431
<v Speaker 3>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're in there in higher </v>

3672
02:43:14.431 --> 02:43:17.131
<v Speaker 3>populations than ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're in higher populations </v>

3673
02:43:17.131 --> 02:43:17.131
<v Speaker 3>because people go over there to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3674
02:43:17.350 --> 02:43:20.110
<v Speaker 3>so they have these places where you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of fucked up.</v>

3675
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a waterhole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit it in front of a waterhole,</v>

3676
02:43:22.091 --> 02:43:23.280
<v Speaker 3>they have a blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hide in,</v>

3677
02:43:23.290 --> 02:43:25.240
<v Speaker 3>the blind animal comes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shoot it,</v>

3678
02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:28.270
<v Speaker 3>and it's all trapped in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3679
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

3680
02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:31.930
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

3681
02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.340
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not like target practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more that than anything else.</v>

3682
02:43:36.370 --> 02:43:37.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

3683
02:43:37.570 --> 02:43:42.570
<v Speaker 3>is it better to go and get a steak from </v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal that lived in captivity or is </v>

3684
02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:46.480
<v Speaker 3>it better to shoot an animal as it goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get water?</v>

3685
02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as good as going to the woods.</v>

3686
02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Like you go into the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go shoot a wild elk.</v>

3687
02:43:51.970 --> 02:43:56.970
<v Speaker 3>That elk does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not even know what a fucking </v>

3688
02:43:56.970 --> 02:43:59.131
<v Speaker 3>person is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully doesn't even see you coming </v>

3689
02:43:59.131 --> 02:44:02.460
<v Speaker 3>and you shoot it and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like the ultimate goal is to </v>

3690
02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:04.750
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously and this wild existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you didn't kill it,</v>

3691
02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:08.260
<v Speaker 3>it would be killed by bears or wolves or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>

3692
02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:11.260
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but or they freeze to death or they kill</v>

3693
02:44:11.261 --> 02:44:13.060
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of killing each other.</v>

3694
02:44:13.270 --> 02:44:14.240
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3695
02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:17.410
<v Speaker 3>these antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like for digging for fruit.</v>

3696
02:44:19.310 --> 02:44:21.010
<v Speaker 3>That's why they have them and each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

3697
02:44:21.450 --> 02:44:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why they have them.</v>

3698
02:44:22.650 --> 02:44:23.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see this deer,</v>

3699
02:44:23.531 --> 02:44:26.680
<v Speaker 3>that's why he has it to kill other deer </v>
<v Speaker 3>so he can get all the pussy.</v>

3700
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:28.180
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

3701
02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:29.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a knife that grows out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

3702
02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:35.340
<v Speaker 3>so it's not fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's crazy is these animals were </v>

3703
02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:38.590
<v Speaker 3>worth nothing and they were being </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered by poachers.</v>

3704
02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3705
02:44:39.371 --> 02:44:40.090
<v Speaker 3>these poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3706
02:44:40.091 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3707
02:44:41.770 --> 02:44:46.330
<v Speaker 3>but they're really fucking poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do about that?</v>

3708
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Because you have these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>living over there that there have to </v>

3709
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:53.050
<v Speaker 3>risk their lives to try to poach these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals for meat,</v>

3710
02:44:53.290 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 3>for food.</v>

3711
02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:58.920
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the horrible trade like rhinos and </v>

3712
02:44:58.920 --> 02:44:59.340
<v Speaker 3>candles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3713
02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:02.020
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's like saying to a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>addict stopped doing heroin.</v>

3714
02:45:02.021 --> 02:45:07.021
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you have to replace it with </v>

3715
02:45:07.021 --> 02:45:07.021
<v Speaker 3>something in the narcotics anonymous or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another drug or something.</v>

3716
02:45:07.021 --> 02:45:08.170
<v Speaker 3>So you can't say stop poaching without </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3717
02:45:08.171 --> 02:45:13.171
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no other way to fucking make </v>

3718
02:45:13.171 --> 02:45:13.171
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3719
02:45:13.171 --> 02:45:13.171
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poverty is insane.</v>

3720
02:45:13.171 --> 02:45:17.881
<v Speaker 3>I have had friends that have gone over </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Africa and one of the things that </v>

3721
02:45:17.881 --> 02:45:18.970
<v Speaker 3>they say is you just like my friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin Wren,</v>

3722
02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.920
<v Speaker 3>who he goes to the Congo stays there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>months at a time and he's building wells</v>

3723
02:45:23.921 --> 02:45:24.880
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing guy.</v>

3724
02:45:24.881 --> 02:45:27.010
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who just got malaria for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the second time.</v>

3725
02:45:27.011 --> 02:45:32.011
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't even understand what</v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty is until you see how these </v>

3726
02:45:32.011 --> 02:45:32.590
<v Speaker 3>people live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These poor people.</v>

3727
02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:35.380
<v Speaker 3>So I don't blame them for poaching.</v>

3728
02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:36.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it becomes,</v>

3729
02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:40.750
<v Speaker 3>if it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's between selling a rhino horn and</v>

3730
02:45:40.751 --> 02:45:44.030
<v Speaker 3>feeding your child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like fuck man.</v>

3731
02:45:44.031 --> 02:45:49.031
<v Speaker 3>Not Online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like looking at the statistics about </v>

3732
02:45:49.031 --> 02:45:49.031
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're literally,</v>

3733
02:45:49.031 --> 02:45:49.400
<v Speaker 3>it's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor be killed.</v>

3734
02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:52.360
<v Speaker 3>They're barely making it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're barely making it.</v>

3735
02:45:52.510 --> 02:45:57.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am 100 percent against killing rhinos </v>

3736
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.510
<v Speaker 3>for their horns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make no mistake about it.</v>

3737
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's horrible and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>

3738
02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:01.060
<v Speaker 3>But these people that were calling </v>
<v Speaker 3>poachers,</v>

3739
02:46:01.270 --> 02:46:01.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3740
02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:03.430
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you add that pejorative,</v>

3741
02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3742
02:46:04.021 --> 02:46:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you give them that label and you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

3743
02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 3>They could do it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a poor people.</v>

3744
02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:13.460
<v Speaker 5>They're desperate poor people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not making that much money.</v>

3745
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:16.610
<v Speaker 5>The people actually kill a rhino.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not making much money.</v>

3746
02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:19.340
<v Speaker 5>They were making a few hundred dollars </v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever the fuck they can get.</v>

3747
02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:24.460
<v Speaker 5>They're selling it to someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that other person is making a fuck load </v>

3748
02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:26.030
<v Speaker 5>of money and it's all gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gross and it's all scary.</v>

3749
02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:31.210
<v Speaker 5>But the Louis Theroux documentary does </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best job of highlighting how fucked </v>

3750
02:46:31.461 --> 02:46:36.461
<v Speaker 5>it is over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's one of the things that the guy </v>

3751
02:46:36.461 --> 02:46:38.411
<v Speaker 5>who runs the camp says to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because Louise like constantly </v>

3752
02:46:38.411 --> 02:46:38.620
<v Speaker 5>pastoring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm badgering him as what does,</v>

3753
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:39.370
<v Speaker 5>why does it plays?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3754
02:46:39.371 --> 02:46:44.371
<v Speaker 5>how are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like giving them all these </v>

3755
02:46:44.371 --> 02:46:44.660
<v Speaker 5>questions and finally the guy snaps and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

3756
02:46:44.661 --> 02:46:46.280
<v Speaker 5>after I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's fucked.</v>

3757
02:46:46.370 --> 02:46:49.520
<v Speaker 5>You don't understand Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he fucked.</v>

3758
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:54.790
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if these fucking animals are not worth </v>

3759
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.790
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd be gone.</v>

3760
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:58.810
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This really crazy moment where you </v>

3761
02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:04.481
<v Speaker 5>realize the problem is not as simple as </v>
<v Speaker 5>why do people want to go over there and </v>

3762
02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:07.430
<v Speaker 5>hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is this breakdown of what we</v>

3763
02:47:07.431 --> 02:47:12.431
<v Speaker 5>call civilization in this area where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have people that are impossibly poor and</v>

3764
02:47:12.921 --> 02:47:17.921
<v Speaker 5>they're surrounded by animals and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only value of around them as animals.</v>

3765
02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:20.540
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy,</v>

3766
02:47:21.050 --> 02:47:26.050
<v Speaker 5>so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's either you're involved in the </v>

3767
02:47:26.050 --> 02:47:29.321
<v Speaker 5>tourism business that has people coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>to look at these animals or you just </v>

3768
02:47:29.321 --> 02:47:29.810
<v Speaker 5>have to fucking kill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

3769
02:47:29.811 --> 02:47:32.870
<v Speaker 5>the tourism industry is not as fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>profitable as the.</v>

3770
02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:38.580
<v Speaker 5>It's just not because it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to go over there and kill a </v>

3771
02:47:38.580 --> 02:47:38.580
<v Speaker 5>lion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it costs you $50,000.</v>

3772
02:47:38.580 --> 02:47:43.480
<v Speaker 5>And what's really fucked up is these </v>
<v Speaker 5>lions now in Zimbabwe where that cecil </v>

3773
02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:45.920
<v Speaker 5>the lion was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're killing 200 of them.</v>

3774
02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.600
<v Speaker 5>They're just going to poach them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not poach them,</v>

3775
02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:52.700
<v Speaker 5>just going assassinate them because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have too many and now the lions are </v>

3776
02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:54.980
<v Speaker 5>destroying all the unduly population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a balance that they had created</v>

3777
02:47:54.981 --> 02:47:59.981
<v Speaker 5>through hunting lions down there like </v>
<v Speaker 5>coyotes or will like here with the </v>

3778
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:02.380
<v Speaker 5>fucking lions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

3779
02:48:02.390 --> 02:48:04.850
<v Speaker 5>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lions are incredible.</v>

3780
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:10.510
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw that thing you posted of the lion </v>

3781
02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:10.510
<v Speaker 5>king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My fucking phone.</v>

3782
02:48:10.510 --> 02:48:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Look again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm jumping off that thing,</v>

3783
02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:16.900
<v Speaker 5>but look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is my phone that I'm fucking lying </v>

3784
02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:18.260
<v Speaker 5>on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have to go to Tippi.</v>

3785
02:48:18.261 --> 02:48:23.261
<v Speaker 5>Hedren some fascinating by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody should shoot </v>

3786
02:48:23.261 --> 02:48:23.261
<v Speaker 5>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to shoot a lion.</v>

3787
02:48:23.261 --> 02:48:24.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's cool,</v>

3788
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:28.430
<v Speaker 5>but they're in the car with teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're terrifying.</v>

3789
02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:33.720
<v Speaker 5>There was a beautiful article that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>written by this woman who lived in </v>

3790
02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.130
<v Speaker 5>Zimbabwe right after the Cecil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lion thing,</v>

3791
02:48:37.310 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 5>and it said in Zimbabwe we don't cry for</v>
<v Speaker 5>lions,</v>

3792
02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:43.140
<v Speaker 5>and it was explaining how they </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrorized her village,</v>

3793
02:48:43.141 --> 02:48:45.830
<v Speaker 5>how they killed her loved ones and how </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were.</v>

3794
02:48:45.831 --> 02:48:50.831
<v Speaker 5>When they would go out into the bush,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be a very real concern that </v>

3795
02:48:50.831 --> 02:48:52.610
<v Speaker 5>they would be killed by a lion and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not that the line is bad,</v>

3796
02:48:52.850 --> 02:48:57.850
<v Speaker 5>it's just that that's what lines they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking do and I can't have too many of </v>

3797
02:48:58.071 --> 02:48:59.390
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

3798
02:48:59.391 --> 02:49:04.391
<v Speaker 5>You can't have too many of them and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only way to control their population is </v>

3799
02:49:04.391 --> 02:49:07.301
<v Speaker 5>human beings and so that thing back to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like we are not the top of the food </v>

3800
02:49:07.301 --> 02:49:08.130
<v Speaker 5>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're</v>

3801
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:10.380
<v Speaker 1>just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not very simple,</v>

3802
02:49:10.410 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are with A.</v>

3803
02:49:12.211 --> 02:49:13.650
<v Speaker 1>With a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are a caveat.</v>

3804
02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a huge caveat with it.</v>

3805
02:49:16.290 --> 02:49:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to first of all know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to shoot a fight like me and that </v>

3806
02:49:21.290 --> 02:49:23.320
<v Speaker 1>machete or Fucking Samurai sword.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the top of the food.</v>

3807
02:49:23.321 --> 02:49:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to fucking use most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the weapons out there.</v>

3808
02:49:26.810 --> 02:49:30.180
<v Speaker 1>A drunk person who wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't walk that good.</v>

3809
02:49:30.181 --> 02:49:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You fuck them up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3810
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:36.790
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on what's the level of the </v>

3811
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:38.500
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since I have no ability to even </v>

3812
02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:39.870
<v Speaker 1>understand how anxious it would make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in a room with the lion,</v>

3813
02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:43.420
<v Speaker 1>a lion is probably faster than me </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up a gun and shooting it.</v>

3814
02:49:44.130 --> 02:49:49.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead by the time I pick it up where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to first of all not just </v>

3815
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:53.031
<v Speaker 1>know how to shoot a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have to have experienced </v>

3816
02:49:53.031 --> 02:49:54.660
<v Speaker 1>shooting a gun under pressure to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety and to shoot it.</v>

3817
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I went to a shooting range and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cool.</v>

3818
02:49:56.940 --> 02:50:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Like I could not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like.</v>

3819
02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

3820
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3821
02:50:10.441 --> 02:50:15.441
<v Speaker 1>shooting guns is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be strong and you have to </v>

3822
02:50:15.441 --> 02:50:15.441
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

3823
02:50:15.441 --> 02:50:16.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn how to do it,</v>

3824
02:50:17.390 --> 02:50:20.120
<v Speaker 1>so it's like most of us don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people,</v>

3825
02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:23.970
<v Speaker 1>even that skill you're shooting at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper that's not going to move.</v>

3826
02:50:23.971 --> 02:50:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a thing that wants to kill me.</v>

3827
02:50:27.170 --> 02:50:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knows how to get around my gun,</v>

3828
02:50:29.881 --> 02:50:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go to an intermediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

3829
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:36.830
<v Speaker 1>go from the piece of paper that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to attack you and try to shoot a </v>

3830
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:41.511
<v Speaker 1>wild pig that you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna eat like it's nerve </v>

3831
02:50:41.511 --> 02:50:43.920
<v Speaker 1>wracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what they called trigger panic</v>

3832
02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.580
<v Speaker 1>where people get on the PA or target </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic there.</v>

3833
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:49.710
<v Speaker 1>They're about to shoot and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep their guns steady.</v>

3834
02:50:49.711 --> 02:50:54.711
<v Speaker 1>They can't keep their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even more difficult with bow and </v>

3835
02:50:54.711 --> 02:50:54.711
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can it steady.</v>

3836
02:50:54.711 --> 02:50:56.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

3837
02:50:56.280 --> 02:50:58.050
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to get it over with.</v>

3838
02:50:58.260 --> 02:51:00.300
<v Speaker 1>You just want to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that noise?</v>

3839
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:09.790
<v Speaker 1>The few of us together when it started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this panic where you just </v>

3840
02:51:12.331 --> 02:51:17.331
<v Speaker 1>want to get it over with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so overwhelmed you can't breathe </v>

3841
02:51:17.331 --> 02:51:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and you just want to pull the trigger in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people miss like the vast </v>

3842
02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:21.510
<v Speaker 1>majority of people that sure bowhunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>miss or rifle hunt,</v>

3843
02:51:21.511 --> 02:51:24.630
<v Speaker 1>miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of controlling anxiety and</v>

3844
02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that exists in the navy seals </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their training as you know,</v>

3845
02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:33.920
<v Speaker 1>they put a bag over their head and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>it off and disorient them so that they </v>

3846
02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.190
<v Speaker 1>can quickly focus their eyes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when something's moving around,</v>

3847
02:51:35.191 --> 02:51:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just like it's a muscle to be asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3848
02:51:38.330 --> 02:51:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3849
02:51:39.340 --> 02:51:42.080
<v Speaker 1>just dealing with adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with anxiety,</v>

3850
02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:45.690
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the moment is here now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been training,</v>

3851
02:51:45.691 --> 02:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you've been preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready crisis on.</v>

3852
02:51:49.050 --> 02:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You see that with fighting all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's guys that look amazing and the </v>

3853
02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:54.380
<v Speaker 1>gym and they get to a fight and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't perform.</v>

3854
02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:57.210
<v Speaker 1>You can't really simulate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3855
02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way in practice to really </v>

3856
02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:03.801
<v Speaker 1>simulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in practice when you have like you </v>

3857
02:52:03.801 --> 02:52:05.990
<v Speaker 1>go a lot like you have simulated fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

3858
02:52:06.170 --> 02:52:09.080
<v Speaker 5>would have like an audience and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 5>his room,</v>

3859
02:52:09.130 --> 02:52:14.130
<v Speaker 5>his practices and talk a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talking Shit puts a lot of pressure on </v>

3860
02:52:14.130 --> 02:52:14.650
<v Speaker 5>you too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big thing.</v>

3861
02:52:15.090 --> 02:52:16.870
<v Speaker 5>Like guys do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bowhunters do that.</v>

3862
02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:19.120
<v Speaker 5>They talk shit to each other while they </v>
<v Speaker 5>practice.</v>

3863
02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:22.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll have competitions and during the</v>

3864
02:52:22.361 --> 02:52:27.361
<v Speaker 5>competition they're talking shit to each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other and the idea of it is you're just </v>

3865
02:52:27.361 --> 02:52:31.111
<v Speaker 5>trying to disorient the guy and it helps</v>
<v Speaker 5>them like guys welcome it because it </v>

3866
02:52:31.111 --> 02:52:35.011
<v Speaker 5>actually helps them concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 5>blocking everything out because the </v>

3867
02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:36.130
<v Speaker 5>moment when you're actually having to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot an animal,</v>

3868
02:52:36.131 --> 02:52:40.840
<v Speaker 5>so your hardest fucking take it in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>air and you freak out.</v>

3869
02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:44.410
<v Speaker 5>So it's nothing like that for someone to</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk shit,</v>

3870
02:52:44.411 --> 02:52:48.670
<v Speaker 5>but at least it's better than you being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some players do that.</v>

3871
02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:49.680
<v Speaker 5>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3872
02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:51.960
<v Speaker 5>They like fuck with each other and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3873
02:52:52.030 --> 02:52:52.990
<v Speaker 5>try to throw each other off.</v>

3874
02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:54.490
<v Speaker 5>I guess it was probably not the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

3875
02:52:54.491 --> 02:52:56.050
<v Speaker 5>but it's more of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3876
02:52:56.110 --> 02:52:58.930
<v Speaker 5>distract the lawyers get in their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that called sharking?</v>

3877
02:52:58.931 --> 02:53:01.990
<v Speaker 5>That's what the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A real a shark is not like,</v>

3878
02:53:02.020 --> 02:53:02.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people think,</v>

3879
02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:03.430
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a pool shark.</v>

3880
02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:06.250
<v Speaker 5>It's not what it means in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pool players.</v>

3881
02:53:06.490 --> 02:53:09.880
<v Speaker 5>Someone is really good at pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would say someone who hides it.</v>

3882
02:53:09.881 --> 02:53:11.920
<v Speaker 5>There are a hustler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who doesn't hide it,</v>

3883
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:13.940
<v Speaker 5>they're a player,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what a shark is,</v>

3884
02:53:13.941 --> 02:53:18.941
<v Speaker 5>is actually a dishonorable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A shark is someone who fucks with your </v>

3885
02:53:18.941 --> 02:53:20.320
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tries to get you to miss.</v>

3886
02:53:20.410 --> 02:53:23.680
<v Speaker 5>Like they might do things on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like drop their queue as you're shooting</v>

3887
02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:24.860
<v Speaker 5>or they might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3888
02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:30.280
<v Speaker 5>they might make a noise to distract you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's called sharking like,</v>

3889
02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:33.370
<v Speaker 5>just to try to psych illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know.</v>

3890
02:53:33.400 --> 02:53:37.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean you can't get where you agree or </v>
<v Speaker 5>not agree,</v>

3891
02:53:37.421 --> 02:53:41.920
<v Speaker 5>but some people just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in tournaments sometimes I feel like</v>

3892
02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:47.220
<v Speaker 5>right before you go on and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird crowd when we were talking about </v>

3893
02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Doug Davidoff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Marin</v>

3894
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:50.920
<v Speaker 1>or that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm the worst is when they're like,</v>

3895
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:53.740
<v Speaker 1>great crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go on and do well,</v>

3896
02:53:53.741 --> 02:53:56.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not because you were good at just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd was good.</v>

3897
02:53:56.500 --> 02:53:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes it's a good warning </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3898
02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:00.110
<v Speaker 5>Came off stage at the Improv the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>night,</v>

3899
02:54:00.111 --> 02:54:05.111
<v Speaker 5>I and he was getting off stage and I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>walking in the room and he came up and </v>

3900
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:05.111
<v Speaker 5>gave me a hug and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3901
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:06.260
<v Speaker 5>worst fucking crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever I'm like,</v>

3902
02:54:06.261 --> 02:54:07.460
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3903
02:54:07.730 --> 02:54:12.730
<v Speaker 5>maybe for you bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I went up there and they were </v>

3904
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:12.730
<v Speaker 5>fucking terrible.</v>

3905
02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Doing crowds are weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a testament to our group.</v>

3906
02:54:15.951 --> 02:54:20.951
<v Speaker 1>Think for a whole crowd to unify as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shitty as just really warm in the room,</v>

3907
02:54:21.441 --> 02:54:23.020
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always bad.</v>

3908
02:54:23.170 --> 02:54:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Never read something about hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes me like what the week was </v>

3909
02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday nights.</v>

3910
02:54:29.390 --> 02:54:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Weird too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got to go to work because</v>

3911
02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you've been there for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at comegys show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3913

<v Speaker 1>no I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not go on past 10:00,</v>

3914
02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

3915
02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I cannot do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3916
02:54:48.410 --> 02:54:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what this is.</v>

3917
02:54:49.671 --> 02:54:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to go home.</v>

3918
02:54:50.871 --> 02:54:52.280
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at their check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3919
02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:57.900
<v Speaker 1>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those experiences are good in </v>

3920
02:54:57.900 --> 02:54:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the beginning for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3921
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3922
02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:04.940
<v Speaker 1>like I paid the fee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I used to do standup at lucky </v>

3923
02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:04.940
<v Speaker 1>strike on</v>

3924
02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:09.580
<v Speaker 4>highland and I'd have to time my jokes </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing a bowling ball was about to hit </v>

3925
02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 4>some pins I'd be like at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

3926
02:55:10.731 --> 02:55:15.731
<v Speaker 4>so then he called me and then I never </v>
<v Speaker 4>called him back like you had to time </v>

3927
02:55:15.731 --> 02:55:17.220
<v Speaker 4>your jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a road gig once at a restaurant in</v>

3928
02:55:17.221 --> 02:55:22.221
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts where the inner calm that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the restaurant use to call people's </v>

3929
02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:26.200
<v Speaker 4>tables was the same system as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>microphone that I used on,</v>

3930
02:55:27.140 --> 02:55:29.210
<v Speaker 4>so it'd be in the middle of talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about something.</v>

3931
02:55:29.390 --> 02:55:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Johnson party of your table's ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking great.</v>

3932
02:55:34.081 --> 02:55:35.930
<v Speaker 4>It was the only time they ever did </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy there.</v>

3933
02:55:36.130 --> 02:55:37.400
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was the only one.</v>

3934
02:55:37.430 --> 02:55:39.440
<v Speaker 4>It was like a one person show too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just went up there.</v>

3935
02:55:39.441 --> 02:55:41.230
<v Speaker 4>I was like this be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever.</v>

3936
02:55:41.330 --> 02:55:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember Miyagi's on sunset?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally do.</v>

3937
02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:46.610
<v Speaker 4>It's a Sushi restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not there anymore.</v>

3938
02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:47.540
<v Speaker 4>You would do.</v>

3939
02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:50.780
<v Speaker 4>There was like a stage Taco now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

3940
02:55:51.230 --> 02:55:55.270
<v Speaker 4>and there was a stage and then there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bridge with like a creek.</v>

3941
02:55:56.190 --> 02:56:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking fountain between you and the </v>

3942
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:06.070
<v Speaker 4>bridge and like a coy gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little Chinese garden and then a </v>

3943
02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:08.650
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people and then they always had</v>
<v Speaker 4>mtv jams on television.</v>

3944
02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:14.520
<v Speaker 4>There were televisions on every wall and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are just watching TV and then </v>

3945
02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.151
<v Speaker 4>you're just yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time Duncan trussell got </v>

3946
02:56:19.151 --> 02:56:20.240
<v Speaker 4>on there and we couldn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't even know people could hear us</v>

3947
02:56:20.241 --> 02:56:21.320
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anyone could even.</v>

3948
02:56:21.330 --> 02:56:24.860
<v Speaker 4>I like I did we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we bombing or can they hear us?</v>

3949
02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:30.400
<v Speaker 4>And then done controls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got on stage and started basically </v>

3950
02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.351
<v Speaker 4>yelling the most offensive things </v>
<v Speaker 4>imaginable and nobody responded and we </v>

3951
02:56:32.351 --> 02:56:32.351
<v Speaker 4>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3952
02:56:32.351 --> 02:56:36.491
<v Speaker 4>they just can't hear us yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was just like yelling and everyone </v>

3953
02:56:36.651 --> 02:56:38.210
<v Speaker 4>just kept eating crazy as me.</v>

3954
02:56:38.210 --> 02:56:42.740
<v Speaker 4>August is across the street from what </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be Dublin's wasn't.</v>

3955
02:56:42.741 --> 02:56:47.741
<v Speaker 4>I didn't ever do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that was like the Hashtag </v>

3956
02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3957

<v Speaker 4>I missed my thing already.</v>

3958
02:56:50.901 --> 02:56:54.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to get my hair back to Brown.</v>

3959
02:56:54.490 --> 02:56:57.740
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's for your sexy and so real.</v>

3960
02:56:57.741 --> 02:56:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3961
02:56:58.850 --> 02:57:02.090
<v Speaker 4>I want to distract anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to become a sex symbol.</v>

3962
02:57:02.450 --> 02:57:07.450
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need that stress and that </v>

3963
02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:07.450
<v Speaker 4>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I have to go back to Burnett.</v>

3964
02:57:07.450 --> 02:57:10.730
<v Speaker 4>This was sort of a just because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>working on something and they just don't</v>

3965
02:57:10.731 --> 02:57:12.120
<v Speaker 4>want it to look blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

3966
02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm bleeding.</v>

3967
02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:19.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not my brand.</v>

3968
02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:21.470
<v Speaker 4>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3969
02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:24.320
<v Speaker 4>this is gonna sound weirdly </v>
<v Speaker 4>narcissistic.</v>

3970
02:57:24.350 --> 02:57:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I for some reason what they're a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>spurt where I was getting recognized a </v>

3971
02:57:29.350 --> 02:57:31.610
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was and I was touring and I was like,</v>

3972
02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:32.870
<v Speaker 4>let me just dye my hair and see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

3973
02:57:32.871 --> 02:57:35.490
<v Speaker 4>And nobody had any idea who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soon as you went blonde,</v>

3974
02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:39.050
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I went blonde I was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely invisible.</v>

3975
02:57:39.230 --> 02:57:42.260
<v Speaker 4>So you have a love hate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>with being recognized?</v>

3976
02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:44.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was literally more like,</v>

3977
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:46.860
<v Speaker 4>let's see what like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3978
02:57:46.890 --> 02:57:48.240
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a,</v>

3979
02:57:48.260 --> 02:57:49.780
<v Speaker 4>it was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

3980
02:57:49.850 --> 02:57:51.080
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't annoy me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't bother me.</v>

3981
02:57:51.081 --> 02:57:56.081
<v Speaker 4>I'm super grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see people that come up to me and </v>

3982
02:57:56.081 --> 02:57:58.241
<v Speaker 4>airports as like my boss,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're the ones that don't say </v>

3983
02:57:58.241 --> 02:57:58.460
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking guy who sent you the email.</v>

3984
02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:00.470
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dynamic.</v>

3985
02:58:00.471 --> 02:58:02.580
<v Speaker 4>But it's outside window probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to hear about this.</v>

3986
02:58:03.610 --> 02:58:04.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's shooting.</v>

3987
02:58:05.710 --> 02:58:06.930
<v Speaker 4>He's an Amy Schumer van.</v>
