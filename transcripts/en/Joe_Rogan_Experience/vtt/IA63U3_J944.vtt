9
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just colorful.</v>

10
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're trying to blend in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>array like could be,</v>

11
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>it does have some camouflaging affects</v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you were a hunting in a rave,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ecstasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a light blue with like purple.</v>

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of decorations.</v>

16
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Camouflage is a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like what you see guys walking down</v>

17
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the street with camouflage and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

18
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>it's what if they really were</v>
<v Speaker 1>camouflaged?</v>

19
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Like he'd just see a head floating down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street and one day they're going to</v>

20
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>have that.</v>

21
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>invention that came up with,</v>

22
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>like a cloak that you can wear and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially takes an image of what's</v>

24
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>behind you and projected on the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

25
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.781
<v Speaker 1>visibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

27
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crude right now,</v>

28
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but what it is is like the guy standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could see it right here.</v>

29
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is ridiculous.</v>

30
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And then nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is wild.</v>

31
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>So this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're,</v>

32
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at is a guy holding a ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ball does it.</v>

33
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>And so the ball somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's holding it in front of his face and</v>

34
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't show him when it's in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and shows what's behind him.</v>

35
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that one's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

36
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the cloak.</v>

37
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the cloak before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

38
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>you can still see the cloak.</v>

39
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing with that kind of</v>

40
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it starts,</v>

41
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>then you're on your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's in one year or three years</v>

42
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>or 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be invisible.</v>

43
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

44
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>we're in such a strange time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>these emerging things are just starting</v>

45
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>to come out where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people go,</v>

46
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>like magic leap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen that magic leap</v>

49
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just retweeted a new version of it</v>

50
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>today that somebody sent me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It just keeps getting so bad.</v>

52
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't magic leap or was it the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>minority report.</v>

61

<v Speaker 1>Like the world is going to be your</v>
<v Speaker 1>desktop.</v>

62
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It will spin things in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop them,</v>

63
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>expand them,</v>

66
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's like we are in probably</v>

67

<v Speaker 1>the fastest time of change ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

68
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you have an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea can be done.</v>

69
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just a series of steps to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

70
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:15.000
<v Speaker 4>doing this.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what the,</v>

86
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.430
<v Speaker 4>somebody is thinking of that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are going to be able to fuck</v>

87
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 4>right in your living room.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's what the new porn is going to be.</v>

89
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.590
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can fuck in my living room.</v>

90
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.453
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

91
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.040
<v Speaker 4>Do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do it yourself world.</v>

92
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 4>We need to get back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get back to doing things.</v>

93
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Actually not just watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

94
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 4>I that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is all weird thing.</v>

95
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as much as you know,</v>

96
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 4>you make comedy and fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts and stuff,</v>

97
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 4>it's still strange that people watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff all the time.</v>

98
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Telling you find would love to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertained.</v>

99
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

100
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 4>we like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we like to just have other people do the</v>

101
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 4>shit that sit back and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

102
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 4>But you would find that this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something I always kind of wonder about</v>

103
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you can possibly consume so many</v>

104
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:08.571
<v Speaker 4>interesting and unrelated topics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>develop expertise in so many unrelated</v>

105
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 4>things while being a content maker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're making stuff that people</v>

106
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 4>consume.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you possibly be mastering all</v>

107
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:17.394
<v Speaker 4>these things at once?</v>

108
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't really have any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

109
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.410
<v Speaker 3>I've mastered anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

110
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good at comedy.</v>

111
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I throw some good kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Jujitsu pretty well.</v>

112
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a master at any of those things.</v>

113
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean your ball hunting,</v>

114
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

115
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

116
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.461
<v Speaker 4>like I literally do fighting stuff all</v>
<v Speaker 4>day every day and when I get a break I</v>

117
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 4>hang out with my wife and sometimes I'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>take a day off and that's it.</v>

118
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

119
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 4>it fascinates me how you can possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>know about so many things that seem</v>

120
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 4>unconnected.</v>

121
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I assume that it's probably some</v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with my brain,</v>

122
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assumed that this,</v>

123
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like an extreme form of add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I need a bunch of different things</v>

124
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 3>going on in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>

125
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't have a bunch of different</v>

126
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 3>things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

127
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel stimulated enough.</v>

128
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost the opposite.</v>

129
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:14.301
<v Speaker 4>It's like I literally specialized so</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply in something once I know</v>

130
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 4>something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to know way more about it.</v>

131
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 4>And when I know stuff about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opens up a ton of new questions and</v>

132
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:25.791
<v Speaker 4>that's why it's the same kind of area of</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff that I am obsessive Lee</v>

133
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:28.140
<v Speaker 4>researching and studying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do that too,</v>

134
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 4>but I just do it with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

135
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm getting at.</v>

136
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.260
<v Speaker 3>I listened to a archery podcasts where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just talking about very specific</v>

137
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.360
<v Speaker 3>ways to hold a bow and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fix your site and make sure you use</v>

138
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 3>it at least properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll listen those fucking things for</v>

139
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:47.420
<v Speaker 3>hours and hours and hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessive Lee and top of practicing.</v>

140
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I just get obsessed with things but I</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to worry about it when I was</v>

141
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:51.381
<v Speaker 3>younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be like,</v>

142
00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't just concentrate on one thing.</v>

143
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:56.330
<v Speaker 3>I always have all these other shit going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in my life.</v>

144
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>But then realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's just</v>

145
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I just enjoy it and just do those</v>

146
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>things then then it doesn't concern me</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm just appreciative that I have</v>

147
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>so many interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read?</v>

148
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some piece somebody wrote something</v>

149
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:11.384
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate Joe Rogan,</v>

151
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 1>or why I hate Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he went on this path and he</v>

152
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>discovered that he actually hated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wear your authentic self.</v>

153
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever read this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wrote this thing and he,</v>

154
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>as he learned more about what it was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be authentically him,</v>

155
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>he realized his hatred for some famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>person was that he was looking at him</v>

156
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and he hated that that guy was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

157
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's easy to hate somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like in the microscope all the</v>

158
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>time because you'll find all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>flaws,</v>

159
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Speaker 1>like if you follow someone every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day in,</v>

160
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>day out and expect perfection or</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

161
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be massively</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed because the kind of</v>

162
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>exposure that you get when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast,</v>

163
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>like when you're talking to someone for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours and hours.</v>

164
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done 700 and what is it,</v>

165
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 760 to 762 podcasts.</v>

166
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 1>The shortest one is an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are three hours.</v>

167
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
<v Speaker 1>It's 2,100 almost 2,500 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around that,</v>

168
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give or take.</v>

169
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>there's know so you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get annoyed at me.</v>

171
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I get annoyed at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

172
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>but his point wasn't that it was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are authentically Joe Rogan,</v>

173
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like whatever it is you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ended up being,</v>

174
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're sitting here in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you built to do the thing that you</v>

175
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the way you want to do it.</v>

176
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:31.040
<v Speaker 1>You're as authentically a human being as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person can be.</v>

177
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Or just so you know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

178
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>accepting why you go and do things the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you do them.</v>

179
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why you do cause you're like fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>being some other thing.</v>

180
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just,</v>

181
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I think having this kind of a life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>super lucky and if I didn't live it that</v>

182
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be taken advantage of this</v>

183
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>huge opportunity that very few people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

184
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Most people have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have an actual fucking job that</v>

185
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't really necessarily like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much?</v>

186
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And somehow or another I've figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way.</v>

187
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I worked when I was younger for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure and I figured out how to get to</v>

188
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>this spot by sort of moving away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I didn't want to do.</v>

189
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>But now that I get to a point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I do,</v>

190
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>whether it's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking forward to this,</v>

191
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get the,</v>

192
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>hang on my friend rob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have some fun talk,</v>

193
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>some MMA and life and all kinds of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same thing.</v>

194
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what I go do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

195
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when I'm practicing archery</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm working out this,</v>

196
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are things I enjoy doing.</v>

197
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I do what I do and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe people can do that.</v>

198
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it just have to start first of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

199
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>by figuring out what it is you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

200
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just going to start</v>

201
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is to be pushed.</v>

202
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all know.</v>

203
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Most people really know what it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love.</v>

204
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I find the young people lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like a lot of young young folks</v>

205
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>when to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't have a path like,</v>

206
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need to find something to do.</v>

207
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe I'll,</v>

208
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll join the military to get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance and some</v>

209
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 3>discipline or maybe I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they just,</v>

210
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to tell because like,</v>

211
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 3>what's cool for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Jamie might not like with Jenny might</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

213
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I might not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

214
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Jamie was trying to find a Kanye west</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>

215
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This jacket is mother.</v>

216
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.000
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker was up all night trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get Kanye West.</v>

217
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true for everybody.</v>

218
00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

219
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.680
<v Speaker 4>I think you got to figure out what it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like doing because the path of going</v>

220
00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:27.850
<v Speaker 4>to do that is the whole point is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people often be like,</v>

221
00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get this kind of job or I want</v>

222
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.010
<v Speaker 4>to buy this kind of house and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not supposed to be that way,</v>

223
00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:35.680
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to start on a path and</v>

224
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.990
<v Speaker 4>on that path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>traveling along it,</v>

225
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.810
<v Speaker 4>you're having adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stumbling onto new things,</v>

226
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.520
<v Speaker 4>and the challenge of it being really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard to achieve is part of what gets you</v>

227
00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:46.550
<v Speaker 4>up every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

228
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.170
<v Speaker 4>and it's also fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Watching things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve,</v>

230
00:09:49.941 --> 00:09:53.240
<v Speaker 3>watching yourself get better at things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and analyzing things and figuring out</v>

231
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:54.710
<v Speaker 3>what the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the holes are,</v>

232
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:58.070
<v Speaker 3>the flaws where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the errors are and your little</v>

233
00:09:58.071 --> 00:09:59.840
<v Speaker 3>system that you've created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

234
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those moments are fucking awesome.</v>

235
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:02.650
<v Speaker 3>They're really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

236
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want really frustrates me,</v>

237
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:06.770
<v Speaker 3>really frustrates me when talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

238
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I'll get messages from people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll say,</v>

239
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's easy for you to,</v>

240
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 3>because you know you've got lucky and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you found it,</v>

241
00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

242
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.020
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have responded in,</v>

243
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.850
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll come up with all these reasons</v>

244
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:22.850
<v Speaker 3>why they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of saying,</v>

245
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my situation is particularly difficult,</v>

246
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.310
<v Speaker 3>but there's a work around and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find it.</v>

247
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might take me a year.</v>

248
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:31.520
<v Speaker 3>It might take me a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find it.</v>

249
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.110
<v Speaker 3>If</v>

250
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 4>wherever it is you're ending up is</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in the future,</v>

251
00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what that is and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

252
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:38.500
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to do that thing I got to</v>

253
00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.360
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have all these responsibilities.</v>

254
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our new job to figure out how to take</v>

255
00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Speaker 4>care of those responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's step one.</v>

256
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what that maslow's hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 4>of needs?</v>

257
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

258
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.900
<v Speaker 4>That idea that first we have to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>

259
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 4>You gotta eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta stay dry and you got to drink</v>

260
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 4>water and once we've kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplished that kind of stuff that's</v>

261
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:00.280
<v Speaker 4>out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we start to go a little further.</v>

262
00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:03.160
<v Speaker 4>How do we become safer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once that happens,</v>

263
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.850
<v Speaker 4>you climb up to the point that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually eating,</v>

264
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 4>sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex.</v>

265
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:09.940
<v Speaker 4>You have a place to live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a job,</v>

266
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.570
<v Speaker 4>and now you're trying to learn more</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and it's just a natural kind of</v>

267
00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:15.670
<v Speaker 4>transition to get smarter and move.</v>

268
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 4>But it's easy to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hard part I think is starting going</v>

269
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.720
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

270
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.000
<v Speaker 4>You know the hard part is going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

271
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:25.210
<v Speaker 4>this isn't working well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if I got some exercise like maybe</v>

272
00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:28.990
<v Speaker 4>that would help like something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For some people that path isn't what job</v>

273
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 4>do I got to start tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That path is like,</v>

274
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm unhealthy are I don't think,</v>

275
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 4>my thought processes aren't things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>lead me this way,</v>

276
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 4>so you've got to start way low on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and start getting that shit</v>

277
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:40.270
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eat good,</v>

278
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.060
<v Speaker 4>get sleep and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit.</v>

279
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Everybody should have to do those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in our society should be shaped in</v>

280
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 4>a way that you have to do those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you aren't doing those things</v>

281
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.270
<v Speaker 4>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're starting from a place where we're</v>

282
00:11:54.271 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 4>just not performing as well as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>

283
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to tell people that though.</v>

284
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just love that food porn.</v>

285
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 4>He just love just shoving doughnuts in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their face.</v>

286
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pasta and just fucking sugar</v>

287
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of things that are</v>

288
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 4>terrible for you that are great</v>
<v Speaker 4>heroines.</v>

289
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 4>I've only been in woodland hills three</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

290
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 4>This is the second time we've been on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your shelf.</v>

291
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 4>The other time was the time I was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>heroin for four days.</v>

292
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the only other time I was in four</v>
<v Speaker 4>days or four days in woodland hills.</v>

293
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:31.330

<v Speaker 4>That's a commitment.</v>

297
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't start that way.</v>

298
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 4>Like lit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all things Mo,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do really stupid things.</v>

300
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 4>I was like 20 and I lived in Winnipeg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manitoba,</v>

301
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been here four times.</v>

331
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:59.250
<v Speaker 4>There was that time that I flew home to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Winnipeg and they flew me back down</v>

332
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.030

<v Speaker 4>Like something's not making a lot of</v>

337
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then around day two I figured out,</v>

338
00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because everyone's on heroin.</v>

339

<v Speaker 4>And it started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had smoked some pot,</v>

340
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 4>which in Winnipeg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Manitoba we called that dope,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you want to smoke some dope?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

342
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.060

<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

343
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 4>so he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you do dope?</v>

344
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:23.681
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I just smoked it with you like 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes ago because no like,</v>

346
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 4>and then before I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he injected me with heroin.</v>

347
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Like a sorta happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to be a,</v>

348
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 4>not super uncool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like not saying yes,</v>

349
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 4>I want to do heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then four days went by like</v>

350
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:44.701
<v Speaker 4>literally just shooting up for days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I just about miss my plane</v>

351
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 4>home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had a girl and a and a home and a</v>

352
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 4>job and all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm kind of at like the plane ticket</v>

353
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 4>and I know it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

354
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 4>if I get a cab in the next two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll get the plane,</v>

355
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 4>I'll get home and whatever.</v>

356
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.511
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

357
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:00.131
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

358
00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 4>and you're not even thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're barely even there.</v>

359
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 4>And somewhere along the line I was just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

360
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:06.280
<v Speaker 4>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just fine.</v>

361
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.320
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to go get on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably got $100 to my name and if I</v>

362
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 4>didn't get on that play and I'd have no</v>
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>

363
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 4>no girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be a heroin addict with no money in</v>

364
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 4>woodland hills with a guy who's doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have his shit together.</v>

365
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 4>I think in the years since he's got his</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit together,</v>

366
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen him since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

367
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 4>I've made myself go and I was sick for</v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three days and I realized like</v>

368
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:34.450
<v Speaker 4>literally that second in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I don't convince myself to get on</v>

369
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 4>that plane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole life is fucking ruined.</v>

370
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

371
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 4>Like I just so vividly remember talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

372
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 4>trying to talk myself into just fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stay here.</v>

373
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I would think to myself,</v>

374
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do?</v>

375
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 4>When are you going to get home?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't fucking worry about a man.</v>

376
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 4>And I just forced my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would literally convincing myself,</v>

377
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 4>don't bother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry.</v>

378
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:58.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was obviously a big deal.</v>

379
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 4>And I got home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was sick for two days and I've never</v>

380
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 4>taken an opiate or any kind of pain</v>
<v Speaker 4>killer ever again.</v>

381
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 4>So you were sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hung over violent form of it</v>

382
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 4>withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably like you'd have to talk to,</v>

383
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

384
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.620
<v Speaker 4>in the course of playing in music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met lots of people who have opiate</v>

385
00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 4>problems and they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aw man,</v>

386
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 4>four days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's nothing.</v>

387
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 4>But to a person who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

388
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:28.220
<v Speaker 4>to a person who was a normal person and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we'll all of a sudden they were</v>

389
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 4>doing drugs for four days.</v>

390
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 4>It probably was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

391
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.260
<v Speaker 4>violent withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was very sick and I knew that day</v>

392
00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm just never going to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of narcotic or painkiller like</v>

393
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 4>that ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

394
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 4>So that was second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last time I was in woodland hills.</v>

395
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

396
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I deal that you could just become that</v>
<v Speaker 4>person like that.</v>

397
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 4>You just the wrong person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to do some dope,</v>

398
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just did dope dying.</v>

399
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.960
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden you're on heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

400
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 4>And there's lots of those little moments</v>
<v Speaker 4>in everybody's life,</v>

401
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you don't,</v>

402
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big one.</v>

403
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.170
<v Speaker 4>But you don't know where they are or</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they are or how they start the,</v>

404
00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 4>you're just suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

405
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 4>Manny lasts as we get all there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we start to get a little smarter.</v>

406
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:18.341
<v Speaker 4>You recognize big risks earlier on down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the road as you get all of their life</v>

407
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 4>experience helps you with that shit.</v>

408
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

409
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking that on the way here</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

410
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

411
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's 25,</v>

412
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 4>26 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So did you ever talk to that guy again?</v>

413
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were in touch about maybe still</v>

414
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 4>putting this band together and then he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was clearly,</v>

415
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had addiction issues.</v>

416
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 4>I followed him a little bit after he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

417
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

418
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 4>had a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's from Finland and he's a pretty big</v>

419
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.460
<v Speaker 4>rockstar in Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he and his wife who was there at the</v>

420
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a woman that I met,</v>

421
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 4>they had a reality show with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

422
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 4>kind</v>

423
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.843
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

424
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 1>what ozzy did but with them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

425
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

426
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:56.904
<v Speaker 1>Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 1>How many people are in Finland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably about half as many as Canada.</v>

428
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That would be my guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which about 30 million.</v>

429
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Some 15 or 20 million maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this big rock star?</v>

430
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 1>We think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

431
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.214
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

432
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole music world is such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different life to me now.</v>

433
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been so deeply embedded in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting for the last decade.</v>

434
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know about much alice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

435
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>he could be the precedent of Finland to</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now for all I know,</v>

436
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:21.910
<v Speaker 1>like I just don't consume a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

437
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of friends now that are</v>

438
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 1>musicians that are doing really well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not making much money.</v>

439
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>

440
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>it's eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eerie when you find out that these</v>

441
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 1>guys who you think would be ballers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of struggling,</v>

442
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you had that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that business is crazy dad.</v>

443
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 1>But the touring is what I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

444
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like how come they're not making</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this money from touring?</v>

445
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:50.920
<v Speaker 1>But I guess it's like a comic has a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower overhead comics.</v>

446
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Just we don't need anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just turn the microphone on and we're</v>

447
00:18:53.221 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need support.</v>

448
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>They have all these other people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>

449
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have people that carry their stuff.</v>

450
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Roadies sound people live lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

451
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 1>They have other people in the band</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

452
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

453
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we went and saw you at cod that</v>

454
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through by the way.</v>

455
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that was fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so at something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have anybody else like us?</v>

459
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Our sound guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the house guy?</v>

460
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Like do you have a house car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to turn the mic off.</v>

461
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

462
00:19:24.451 --> 00:19:26.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just so low maintenance being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

463
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

464
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.940
<v Speaker 1>sell tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get there and you say hi and you</v>

465
00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:35.941
<v Speaker 1>can just go do your act except for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years developing,</v>

466
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.980
<v Speaker 1>you're building it and having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the insight to understanding how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh and all that kind of stuff.</v>

468
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

469
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you of developing your ability to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>an act,</v>

470
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but the act itself is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives for about two years dies.</v>

471
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to like let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

472
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build it up,</v>

473
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you put it on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on some sort of a special or a cd</v>

474
00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to abandon it and wow.</v>

475
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>And then you move on to the next two</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

476
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And in those two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pull this back to fighting</v>

477
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 1>because everything gets pulled back.</v>

478
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to just scope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to talk about fighting</v>

479
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling myself that outside of</v>

480
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 1>work regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actively trying to find other things to,</v>

481
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>to know about or learn about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

482
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build like structures around</v>

483
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:25.050
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

484
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 1>So Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to fight Stephen Thompson,</v>

485
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.890
<v Speaker 1>his whole world has been built like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>act for years.</v>

486
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.980
<v Speaker 1>He's built that thing and structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>were built around how to perform that</v>

487
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 1>act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden it's just</v>

488
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 1>dated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to work in this</v>

489
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:41.960
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

490
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a two completely dated when you're</v>

491
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>dealing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things at wonderboy didn't</v>

492
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

493
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't see up until he came</v>

494
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 1>around and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one big one was the front leg attacks,</v>

495
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 1>his front leg side kick in front leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>roundhouse kick to the face and you see</v>

496
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 1>he hit johnny with the front leg side</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick to the body.</v>

497
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You can see it really shook johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then immediately afterwards he goes</v>

498
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>high and hits him with the front leg</v>
<v Speaker 1>roundhouse kick right in the chin.</v>

499
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

500
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy can do some shit with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet that I'm just not geared up for.</v>

501
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that he didn't have the timing</v>

502
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:21.301
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Johnny was in a gym boxing with</v>

503
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots and lots of boxes because his hands</v>

504
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to get some moving around.</v>

505
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 1>As long as guys stand in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that literally what</v>

506
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Thompson dead and what your step</v>
<v Speaker 1>really exciting thing is seeing right</v>

507
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:40.861
<v Speaker 1>now is this weird moment where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a great wrestler.</v>

508
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 1>So what am I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go Linda Russell.</v>

509
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to fucking learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestle.</v>

510
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.940
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that anyways.</v>

511
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>We got to learn to make it not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

512
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.690
<v Speaker 1>We've got to make it so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean mma developed by finding the</v>

513
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 1>answer to the thing and somewhere all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

514
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>every coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of us,</v>

515
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years ago,</v>

516
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

517
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 1>well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's boxing,</v>

518
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,</v>

519
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 1>this cage work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how fighting is done.</v>

520
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're fucking way wrong.</v>

521
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So when that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think that we start building a</v>

522
00:22:13.151 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 1>structured gym environment curriculums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we train and that thing gets more</v>

523
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>ingrained and complicated and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym,</v>

524
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you work these four or five things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy over here is working on other</v>

525
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 1>stuff and a whole gym is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

526
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 1>all our training partners are like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're working the mixed martial arts</v>

527
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 1>curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some other guy isn't.</v>

528
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And when he develops that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not prepared for it.</v>

529
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>We're just not prepared for sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>karate.</v>

530
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.130
<v Speaker 1>That's poor karate blitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that Thompson can do.</v>

531
00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 1>But also he came from a kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

532
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So he's got the sport karate ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leap in sorta like Raymond Daniels or</v>

533
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:52.900
<v Speaker 1>fights and glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got that leap in attack ability.</v>

534
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 1>That's very difficult to deal with if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that kind of footwork.</v>

535
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can string together beautiful hand</v>

536
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'll,</v>

537
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 1>he'll slide in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blitz you with four or five beautiful</v>

538
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:09.210
<v Speaker 1>hand combinations and then slide away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then kick you in the stomach as he</v>

539
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 1>sliding away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

540
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the bewildered look on</v>

541
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Johnny's face in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And he's a brilliant fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the champ.</v>

543
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>He was a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Johnny's got that style where he'll</v>

544
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:22.670
<v Speaker 1>stay like johnny and Robbie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

545
00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 1>stood in front of each other and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not going to find that with</v>

546
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>wonderboy.</v>

547
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just not there.</v>

548
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this guy's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

549
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to try this guy,</v>

550
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:36.230
<v Speaker 1>he's holding up a plastic cell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it plastic sell plastics?</v>

551
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Like they sent us a conor mcgregor doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a look that is all stumpy and like</v>

552
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same guys who sent the Biggie doll</v>

553
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.130
<v Speaker 1>that sent us a conor mcgregor and James</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a Tupac over there.</v>

554
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a Bruce Lee for Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

555
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

556
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:55.580
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what he can do with his feet is not</v>

557
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 1>nearly at the level that Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson is.</v>

558
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Thompson's doing some shit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet,</v>

559
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 1>the way he's throwing kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deadly.</v>

560
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

561
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best kick boxers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans really ever produced.</v>

562
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>57 and o as a kickboxer and that,</v>

563
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 1>and so then you go and train with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman,</v>

564
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:15.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

566
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and Weidman roughs you up and Rodman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weidman's work ethic and,</v>

567
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing rubs off on you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just start getting familiar with it.</v>

568
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

569
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I can defend take downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

570
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 1>we ain't fucking wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to wrestle.</v>

571
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And it seems him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz,</v>

572
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if fucking absolute genius.</v>

573
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.290
<v Speaker 1>All these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Demetrius and,</v>

574
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and Matt Hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play this game.</v>

575
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:39.870
<v Speaker 1>So we're sitting here and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>

576
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.990
<v Speaker 1>we can't wrestle from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

577
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So for you to get to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to travel through space as you</v>

578
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 1>move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two feet.</v>

579
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I moved back to feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You moved that way,</v>

580
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>two feet and he played this game where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep the space forever and I just</v>

581
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>keep that space as long as you want me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making that space.</v>

582
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And when the space is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either you're going to get so lulled</v>

583
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:01.320
<v Speaker 1>into it that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

584
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Dardin and wonderboy as weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours kicks.</v>

585
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 1>But some guys will do with their hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Darden and hit you or you start</v>

586
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:09.890
<v Speaker 1>chasing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Chase van intercept two and fuck you</v>

587
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:12.740
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just so logical and you're</v>

588
00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 1>looking at it now and just the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the karate guys had to go learn to</v>

589
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 1>wrestle or did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to learn to not wrestle to make</v>

590
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:23.360
<v Speaker 1>it not about wrestling as much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

591
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 1>The Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Matt Hughes style of fighter,</v>

592
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.180
<v Speaker 1>they got to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure it out.</v>

593
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was he learned how to get</v>

594
00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:35.750
<v Speaker 1>comfortable standing up where he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about being taken down all the</v>

595
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to see what he's really</v>

596
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>capable of with his striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you look at his earlier fights,</v>

597
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.100
<v Speaker 1>he was a little more tight because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was worried about being taken down.</v>

598
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So all that takedown defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he always had the great footwork,</v>

599
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but now he also has a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do grab him.</v>

600
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So when guys grab him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not out of water,</v>

601
00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:56.570
<v Speaker 1>he knows what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can break free again and it is way</v>

602
00:25:56.571 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>harder to take someone down when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not trying to rustle with you.</v>

603
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>If someone's trying to be aggressive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

604
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you can counter and you can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of,</v>

605
00:26:05.951 --> 00:26:06.450
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

606
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>of openings that they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when someone is just being</v>

607
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:10.750
<v Speaker 1>defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if Jujitsu,</v>

608
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 1>if you roll with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to tap someone who's just</v>

609
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 1>being defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to attack is when</v>

610
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 1>they open up and they go after you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you can get them.</v>

611
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>That's when they leave openings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is saying,</v>

612
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing with wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys like Mirko Cro cop was a</v>

613
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 1>great example when he first started</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting in pride,</v>

614
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.740
<v Speaker 1>he took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.450
<v Speaker 1>just like a year or so and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden he had takedown defense figured</v>

616
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 1>out and everybody was fucked because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got to stand with this guy.</v>

617
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 1>And he was one of the best examples of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level kickboxer that entered into</v>

618
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 1>mma because he was always a one shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive</v>

619
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 3>striker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a guy like Ernesto hoost was a</v>

620
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:51.120
<v Speaker 3>combination fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy who through beautiful technically</v>

621
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 3>perfect combinations but never really</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Alec blitzed in and exploded.</v>

622
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.120
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like the blitz is a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of MMA fighting.</v>

623
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

624
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean the tactical striking for sure is</v>
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>

625
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 3>but I think you've gotta be able to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mark quickly.</v>

626
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 3>Especially with those little gloves.</v>

627
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the f the footwork,</v>

628
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 4>if it gets me over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets you over here that I have to take</v>

629
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:18.990
<v Speaker 4>one step just center back into you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you blitz me there.</v>

630
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:23.580
<v Speaker 4>That's when Dominic's doing for the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of years and then he start now</v>

631
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.880
<v Speaker 4>get so good at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't quite figure out how to,</v>

632
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 4>even like the Anthony Johnson is so good</v>
<v Speaker 4>at staying in balance to hit you</v>

633
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 4>wherever you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in balance to hit you because Henry</v>

634
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 4>hoofed looked at him and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the key to this guy?</v>

635
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.340
<v Speaker 4>Just put them in a place where he can</v>
<v Speaker 4>always hit.</v>

636
00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like put them in a place where you can</v>

637
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 4>deliver with power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really good at that.</v>

638
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Small little steps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

639
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dominick Cruz could dance all around</v>

640
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.780
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominick Cruz can move it so that he has</v>

641
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 4>to step back to him.</v>

642
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 4>That's when he'll get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you get so good at that one thing</v>

643
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 4>and he just starts camouflaging with</v>
<v Speaker 4>other things.</v>

644
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Now you don't know when it's coming now</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you hesitate.</v>

645
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you hesitate,</v>

646
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 4>he has an an option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you chase,</v>

647
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 4>he has more options.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think it's better to stay,</v>

648
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 4>to stay still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you do.</v>

649
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Then you get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you think,</v>

650
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 4>I better get after him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you do,</v>

651
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 4>you get intercepted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that whole thing must become so</v>

652
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:15.660
<v Speaker 4>frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

653
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 4>so mentally frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you're like,</v>

654
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I got to take this guy down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in some cases that's what they're</v>

655
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 4>waiting for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

656
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.330
<v Speaker 4>hit you on the way in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that game is so it,</v>

657
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like the big difference.</v>

658
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can't do that,</v>

659
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.050
<v Speaker 4>if I can't do that and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

660
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

661
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.520
<v Speaker 4>I have to fight.</v>

662
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.290
<v Speaker 3>That was Ali and his is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

663
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.030
<v Speaker 3>You know when Ali was young before they</v>
<v Speaker 3>took away his title and he was kicked</v>

664
00:28:41.031 --> 00:28:43.670
<v Speaker 3>out of boxing for three years and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came back and he's much more flat</v>

665
00:28:43.671 --> 00:28:46.280
<v Speaker 3>footed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the early days when you would watch</v>

666
00:28:46.281 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Ali fight guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be able to move away from them</v>

667
00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:53.390
<v Speaker 3>and then slide back in and hit them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they really didn't have a solution to</v>

668
00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:55.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you don't have a solution to</v>

669
00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:56.570
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're getting hit and you're</v>

670
00:28:56.571 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 3>not being able to hit the other guy.</v>

671
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.710
<v Speaker 4>And the just think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

672
00:29:00.711 --> 00:29:03.740
<v Speaker 4>you can be ready yourself for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're prepared,</v>

673
00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.780
<v Speaker 4>you know it's a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you've been working on answer.</v>

674
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like I thought for sure Duane</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ludwig with Tj,</v>

675
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.660
<v Speaker 4>they would have worked on like</v>
<v Speaker 4>situational things and maybe they did.</v>

676
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like when he's here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're either going to option a or b.</v>

677
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.870
<v Speaker 4>We know these are some of his choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big,</v>

678
00:29:20.871 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 4>broad strokes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>answers and it worked sometimes.</v>

679
00:29:23.631 --> 00:29:25.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean we look back in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought Dominic won,</v>

680
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.900
<v Speaker 4>but Tj had the moments where he had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest shots or the cleanest shots.</v>

681
00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 4>There was only half a dozen of them in</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 minutes,</v>

682
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.740
<v Speaker 4>but at you saw that was the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it must be incredibly frustrating to</v>

683
00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.420
<v Speaker 4>be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're mentally prepared for it.</v>

684
00:29:38.421 --> 00:29:41.560
<v Speaker 4>You got the answers and as the minutes</v>
<v Speaker 4>are clicking away you're like,</v>

685
00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:42.394
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

686
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone lied to me.</v>

687
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.490
<v Speaker 4>That feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that must be the worst.</v>

688
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 4>When you know you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

689
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.860
<v Speaker 4>they lied to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by that?</v>

690
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:54.510
<v Speaker 4>There was a Mensa Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Phil Davis is like a,</v>

691
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:56.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of felt him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I love filterings.</v>

692
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was fighting Anthony Johnson and he</v>

693
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Speaker 4>went for that first take down and you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and you look the look on his face</v>

694
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 4>when he fails that take down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this is not what I was told it</v>

695
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:08.590
<v Speaker 4>was going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe somebody lied to me.</v>

696
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a funny way to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is not how it was supposed to</v>

697
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:13.840
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

698
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 4>This is not holy fuck Anthony Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone said he I was going to be able</v>

699
00:30:18.491 --> 00:30:19.660
<v Speaker 4>to take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

700
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.900
<v Speaker 4>and that look on his face like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>changes everything.</v>

701
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.490
<v Speaker 4>The whole fight now from this moment</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this big dude stop my takedown,</v>

702
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 4>shook it off and kind of looked at me</v>
<v Speaker 4>now the whole fight is nothing like I</v>

703
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:31.910
<v Speaker 4>had laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

704
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

705
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 4>if dominic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you wants to Tj fight,</v>

706
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:43.050
<v Speaker 4>like the big moments that Tj had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what Dwayne was twice trying to</v>

707
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 4>get him to do more was not load up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was really trying to knock</v>

708
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 4>dominic out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really what he wanted to</v>

709
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe if we just concentrated</v>

710
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:55.540
<v Speaker 4>more on the leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had that one leg where it</v>

711
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 4>turned out the dominic had had like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious injury with his foot,</v>

712
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 4>like plantar fasciitis and it turned out</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have you,</v>

713
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 4>what does it like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

714
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.920
<v Speaker 4>So I actually had it after a fight.</v>

715
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.900
<v Speaker 4>My last fight was my best performance</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever and uh,</v>

716
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.860
<v Speaker 4>and it went great and that fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>

717
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:15.970
<v Speaker 4>going up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy was a very good striker compared</v>

718
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:20.140
<v Speaker 4>to me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thought I was going to take him down,</v>

719
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 4>that he assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we knew that he knew that was what I was</v>

720
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 4>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only that wasn't what I was going to do.</v>

721
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:26.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to put them up against the</v>

722
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:30.100
<v Speaker 4>cage and hauled them there and beat him</v>
<v Speaker 4>up there until he got tired and I could</v>

723
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 4>find a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we were not planning to take them</v>

724
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were planning to put him against the</v>

725
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 4>cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all that leverage,</v>

726
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:39.400
<v Speaker 4>like all that driving off the foot</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the cage,</v>

727
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hurt my foot.</v>

728
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:43.480
<v Speaker 4>And then we went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I went on vacation right</v>

729
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:47.240
<v Speaker 4>after and we walked nonstop the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>day that we were there,</v>

730
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:47.800
<v Speaker 4>just nonstop.</v>

731
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 4>And the next day the fasciitis happened</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it feels literally like,</v>

732
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.390
<v Speaker 4>like you can't even put weight on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot like kids so inflamed and you don't</v>

733
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 4>know what it is like did you damage it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a just hurt and it hurt for months</v>

734
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.030
<v Speaker 4>and months and months and months after</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just yoga actually helped it real.</v>

735
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strengthening of foot and ankle.</v>

736
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yoga is one of the things that um,</v>

737
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I've found I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to sort of getting in how much my feet</v>

738
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:11.260
<v Speaker 4>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

739
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because my feet are weaker.</v>

740
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

741
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 4>Cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're big and your feet and ankles are</v>

742
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Speaker 4>designed to do the stuff that you do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and now you're asking them to do</v>

743
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 4>all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was surprised because I felt like,</v>

744
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 4>well I do so much barefoot or lift</v>
<v Speaker 4>weights barefoot.</v>

745
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.690
<v Speaker 4>I kicked the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's barefoot.</v>

746
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.380
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not going to be hard to just</v>

747
00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:34.510
<v Speaker 4>stand on my feet and hold poses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was pretty hard for like the</v>

748
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 4>first couple months I would have like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some serious foot pain,</v>

749
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 4>certain positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then now they're stronger.</v>

750
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's much better.</v>

751
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably my weakest part is uh,</v>

752
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 1>my balancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balancing my foot there as SA.</v>

753
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 1>When you had Carlos and his movement guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>on him and that was one of the things</v>

754
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 1>they talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that you don't</v>

755
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:56.600
<v Speaker 1>portel talks about too is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest weaknesses and our</v>

756
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:59.060
<v Speaker 1>whole chain for most of us is our feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her ankles.</v>

757
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>That's nick curse on his number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

758
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the number one thing that you</v>

759
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:04.450
<v Speaker 1>like to work on with fighters is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot strength flats.</v>

760
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>The number one thing that guys have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to,</v>

761
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they need to improve with mine just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully inflamed for a long time after</v>

762
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 1>that fight and just mistreatment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were already so what do you do for</v>

763
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

764
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I was in Mexico and I would have to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit against,</v>

765
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:25.520
<v Speaker 1>lean on my wife to get to the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to drink some Tequila so that it would</v>

766
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 1>hurt a little less so I could get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool where it didn't hurt as much.</v>

767
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Because you had water boiling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so will you like taking painkillers are</v>

768
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:35.920
<v Speaker 1>anti inflammatory pain killer since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last time?</v>

769
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opiates and advil.</v>

770
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Advil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally couldn't walk for three</v>

771
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:42.860
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

772
00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I would lean on her to get to the bar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some Tequila so that it is the,</v>

773
00:33:47.831 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 1>the Fascia of the bar on the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foot that separates is that</v>

774
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.040
<v Speaker 1>separates or inflames and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got it.</v>

775
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The plantar Fascia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

776
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it affects people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

777
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's over,</v>

778
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it shortens,</v>

779
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.640
<v Speaker 1>it gets hard and it shortens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hurts your foot in other ways.</v>

780
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird kind of spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're walking on that all day.</v>

781
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climbing and fighting and running and</v>

782
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever things we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that thing right there is on the</v>

783
00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:16.351
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

784
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you gotta figure that's going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>some abuse in your life.</v>

785
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.120
<v Speaker 1>They also say a big issue is shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way,</v>

786
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:25.130
<v Speaker 1>the padding that we have on shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra like the runner's padding in</v>

787
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:26.660
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really supposed to have like the</v>

788
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:29.990
<v Speaker 1>most minimal amount of protection from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment as possible.</v>

789
00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Just a thin minimalist type of a shoe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that allows us to use our feet.</v>

790
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.040
<v Speaker 1>The thing we got is just a big lump on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

791
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't get to use it.</v>

792
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when,</v>

793
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.910
<v Speaker 1>when you train in taekwondo growing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>like martial arts for kids like kids and</v>

794
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 1>teenagers and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

795
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of make everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

796
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.990
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely flexibility.</v>

797
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still really flexible at 48.</v>

798
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'd never stopped doing it,</v>

799
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:56.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because I started doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>before my body grew up.</v>

800
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

801
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

802
00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:59.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying now is that like</v>

803
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 1>navy seals that are learning going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through training and everything with</v>

804
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.720
<v Speaker 1>those toe shoes.</v>

805
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to stop them from wearing</v>

806
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>those toe shoes because so many guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are feet are not strong enough to</v>

807
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 1>run and do all these exercises in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because they're used to wearing</v>

808
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 1>like you basic running shoe with a thick</v>
<v Speaker 1>heel.</v>

809
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

810
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.050
<v Speaker 1>people are listening to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

811
00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a Ted talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they went over how someone had</v>

812
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 1>created one of those running shoes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thick heel area and what did it done</v>

813
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.050
<v Speaker 1>is really essentially change the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>people run.</v>

814
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It changed their gate and it made people</v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

815
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:37.350
<v Speaker 1>He'll first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is totally unnatural.</v>

816
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to</v>

817
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 3>run like ball of the foot first and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot's supposed to absorb the energy.</v>

818
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know your foot access sort of like a</v>

819
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 3>spring and it slows you down at</v>
<v Speaker 3>decelerates you and that's how you're</v>

820
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 3>supposed to run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You push off that and you run with that.</v>

821
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

822
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 3>your foot will be very strong and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could run long distances and your foot</v>

823
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 3>will stay healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're used to using those</v>

824
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 3>running shoes with the big heel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go heel down first.</v>

825
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that strength in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot and you can get really fucking</v>

826
00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 3>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you try to do the same amount of</v>

827
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 3>miles and the same intense workout would</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a toe shoe or something like that</v>

828
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.030
<v Speaker 3>because your feet are just not designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it yet.</v>

829
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditioned for it.</v>

830
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Rather.</v>

831
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.800
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing like when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're telling them not to use these</v>

832
00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 1>shoes because they're feet aren't strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

833
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but if they use the shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feet will become strong enough,</v>

834
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they want them to go through some</v>

835
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorous soul searching,</v>

836
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workouts.</v>

837
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

838
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.750
<v Speaker 1>we had talked about I was hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did yoga.</v>

839
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It fixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did yoga.</v>

840
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 1>It hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's better.</v>

841
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Like you'll have to go through a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of heart.</v>

842
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to go through a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

843
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge to repair it,</v>

844
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

845
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.620
<v Speaker 1>it strikes me so strange when you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about some things that we,</v>

846
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 1>that humans do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something as small or big as gone,</v>

847
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to wear these shoes,</v>

848
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.170
<v Speaker 1>changes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only how we are our future,</v>

849
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:58.510
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these little things that we do as,</v>

850
00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.353
<v Speaker 1>as people.</v>

851
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never,</v>

852
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you're never able to project the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bad outcomes of them in the</v>

853
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to deal with them when</v>

854
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:06.751
<v Speaker 1>they happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

855
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan.</v>

856
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like minimalist</v>

857
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.990
<v Speaker 1>footwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of wearing like real,</v>

858
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I workout with the either barefoot or</v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

859
00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I have these new balances lists like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>slipper.</v>

860
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the exact same black,</v>

861
00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:21.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're like this little thin thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're the toe shoes.</v>

862
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:24.280
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn people give you a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>

864
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.640

<v Speaker 1>I do still do a lot of power lifting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just love it.</v>

866
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do yoga and martial arts and</v>

867
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>an offset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love heavy lifting and deadlifts.</v>

868
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't use padding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

869
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna lose force and we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use some time usually or I'll use the</v>

870
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 1>new balance ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not Nike's rather converse all</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you climb something with these</v>

876
00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:01.640
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

877
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.560

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

881
00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 1>You do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go and he,</v>

882

883
00:38:11.451 --> 00:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Compete in the hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't my,</v>

884
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I won the nationals at my age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

885
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I traded this place.</v>

886
00:38:17.541 --> 00:38:19.150
<v Speaker 1>How much do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you lift and how much you want.</v>

887
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Then I would weigh about one 55 and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadlift maybe like three 63 zero a lot</v>

888
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.130
<v Speaker 1>of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my benches maybe two 30,</v>

889
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.470
<v Speaker 1>two 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't sound like a lot of weight</v>

890
00:38:30.471 --> 00:38:32.690
<v Speaker 1>to people who go to the gym and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it around.</v>

891
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.260
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

892
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 1>a one 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a of weight,</v>

893
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but a power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

894
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 1>like at a regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bench press,</v>

895
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you bring it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to stop all movement and you</v>

896
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 1>wait for the command to push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

897
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.290
<v Speaker 1>it's how long do you wait until all</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to stop?</v>

898
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Might be one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second.</v>

899
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Could be two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be three.</v>

900
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.260
<v Speaker 1>They say press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't bounce it on no bounds.</v>

901
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Stop all movement and press from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

902
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 1>But I trained at this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

903
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.120

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

921
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.250
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be the only thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do because weightlifting,</v>

922
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned you lifted weights all</v>

923
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:36.280
<v Speaker 1>your life and all of a sudden you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga and it added so much.</v>

924
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:39.820
<v Speaker 1>But if you're lifting weights and doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and doing yoga and doing</v>

925
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 1>flexibility stuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's hard to do.</v>

926
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That goes right back to what we said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to work out,</v>

927
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to and you got to sleep or else you</v>

928
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.040
<v Speaker 1>won't have a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

929
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 1>how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how most people don't have the time to</v>

930
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.270
<v Speaker 1>do all the different things you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do?</v>

931
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most frustrating things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people that get into Jujitsu is</v>

932
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:58.060
<v Speaker 1>they just do Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always like,</v>

933
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really should lift some weights.</v>

934
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're getting older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's one of the most important</v>

935
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 1>things to preserve the joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like keeping muscle tissue strong and</v>

936
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making sure that you've got good</v>

937
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 1>muscle density that protect those joints</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know you're engaging in a</v>

938
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:19.300
<v Speaker 1>form of combat on a regular basis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing no strengthening other than</v>

939
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:20.134
<v Speaker 1>that combat.</v>

940
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So we are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to the gym,</v>

941
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you see them white tie guys and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing around and move in and stuff.</v>

942
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That Jujitsu guys are sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>chatting,</v>

943
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that mood makes you feel like it's</v>

944
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:34.780
<v Speaker 1>not combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you do Jujitsu and it's fucking</v>

945
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:37.990
<v Speaker 1>fighting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's physically fighting,</v>

946
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 1>your joints are fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the mood of it makes it feel</v>

947
00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

948
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bit of a stoner sport in some</v>

949
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:46.540
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys just chill out and they're wearing</v>

950
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the pajamas hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's fighting,</v>

951
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting caught and things,</v>

952
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to fight out of them or</v>

953
00:40:52.631 --> 00:40:55.720
<v Speaker 1>trying to not tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put tremendous amount of pressure on</v>

954
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:57.910
<v Speaker 1>your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous amount of pressure on your</v>

955
00:40:57.911 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your back.</v>

956
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.600
<v Speaker 1>The Lowe's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pressure on your back to try to</v>

957
00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>get out of situations.</v>

958
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.550
<v Speaker 1>You're contorting yourself often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>and you really need to be strong in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those areas.</v>

960
00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible is a big one.</v>

961
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a first time I met Eddy,</v>

962
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I took his seminar and Eddie's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>room full of people and I think he maybe</v>

963
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 1>had hard him say this before in a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

964
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And if people are stretching and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

965
00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:24.910
<v Speaker 1>well you gotta you gotta work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody said,</v>

966
00:41:24.911 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 1>well this is as flexible as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

967
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that is a very north American line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

968
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And no other place where people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is as flexible as I am.</v>

969
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.900
<v Speaker 1>They'd say this is as flexible as I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

970
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>If I work at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will become more flexible,</v>

971
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 1>like everything in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason we have these</v>

972
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:43.970
<v Speaker 1>limiting beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

973
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how to play piano?</v>

974
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

975
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 1>But you could learn how to play piano if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was important to you and then the</v>

976
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.110
<v Speaker 1>fingers work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

977
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And in six weeks you'd be a better piano</v>
<v Speaker 1>player than you are today.</v>

978
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And in three years you'd be away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better Piano player.</v>

979
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.100
<v Speaker 1>That's true of every single thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

980
00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons I learned stuff</v>

981
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from studying fighters,</v>

982
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 1>like I learned stuff about life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of stuff,</v>

983
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 1>but one of those big ones is that growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>

984
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 1>The idea that if we put in time on</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

985
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>it'll get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the work itself is the point that</v>

986
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.120
<v Speaker 1>thing for some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

987
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.140
<v Speaker 1>if a kid has that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their whole life is better,</v>

988
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.660
<v Speaker 1>if any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can have it at 40 or 50 or 60.</v>

989
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:26.540
<v Speaker 1>The idea that whatever I am is not what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

990
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's what I am today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can improve those things.</v>

991
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great attitude.</v>

992
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a great way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I am is what I am today.</v>

993
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

994
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

995
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this little thing.</v>

996
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:41.830
<v Speaker 1>This thing's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

997
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that guy a lot and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

998
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about people hating</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometime people that they see on tv.</v>

999
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Some people hate this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garcia.</v>

1000
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He talks a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1002
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it perfectly.</v>

1003
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that guy has is that</v>

1004
00:42:59.421 --> 00:43:04.421
<v Speaker 1>insane growth mindset think it's to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything is possible.</v>

1005
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I believe anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you win a 155 belt,</v>

1006
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go fight for fight Robbie.</v>

1007
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you one that,</v>

1008
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold and then you know,</v>

1009
00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.910
<v Speaker 1>John John's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are limits.</v>

1010
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are fucking limits,</v>

1011
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but he actually believes there are none</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that belief.</v>

1012
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.530
<v Speaker 1>He's better at everything than he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and he's still rockhold kick</v>

1013
00:43:28.531 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 1>some butt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize</v>

1014
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1015
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that belief that there is no point,</v>

1016
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that belief that there is no limit</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever is incredibly powerful when</v>

1017
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>it's put together with a drive of a work</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic,</v>

1018
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:48.140
<v Speaker 1>with an insane work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a powerful thing.</v>

1019
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting too because with</v>

1020
00:43:50.151 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're in camp,</v>

1021
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you're preparing for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific opponent.</v>

1022
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:59.510
<v Speaker 1>You're not really picking up new skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they really pick up skills is by</v>

1023
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>training and taking chances and going</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the comfort zone,</v>

1024
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.420
<v Speaker 1>which is really not something you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do while you're conditioning yourself</v>

1025
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:08.060
<v Speaker 1>for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when a lot of times when guys are</v>

1026
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 1>going back to back to back and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting along,</v>

1027
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>then I'm really improving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much they're doing is just,</v>

1028
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 1>they're improving their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>compete because they're getting more</v>

1029
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:17.330
<v Speaker 1>comfortable because they're competing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

1030
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 1>They're getting relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in great shape and uh,</v>

1031
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 1>they're getting used to the feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in competition.</v>

1032
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1033
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of time to take some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to just go over new stuff,</v>

1034
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 1>to learn new things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to add new weapons.</v>

1035

<v Speaker 4>could pick his mind a bit before doing</v>

1039
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.510
<v Speaker 4>this breakdown.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it is or will be.</v>

1048
00:44:58.441 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 4>We're not super on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long have you been doing?</v>

1049
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.510
<v Speaker 4>We've been doing it for a year with a</v>

<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1055
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.161
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1056
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1057
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 4>and I've been doing with him and he is</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the SPG team.</v>

1060
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I asked him about Khan and</v>

1061
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 4>we're very good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1062
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 4>but when I ask him about connor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1063
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 4>conor is his own coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I know at the same time when you</v>

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:35.680
<v Speaker 4>work with the coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 4>his own mental coach,</v>

1066
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want information from David,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wants it from 50 sources.</v>

1067
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:48.291
<v Speaker 4>He's consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consuming like a philosophy and ideas of</v>

1068
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:52.050
<v Speaker 4>how to improve and ideas of what it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be your authentic self,</v>

00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 4>peak performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that kind of stuff's not constantly</v>

1070
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 4>consuming it but at Shell mate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my inside Info that I get from David</v>

1071
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:00.210
<v Speaker 4>working with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1072
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 4>they don't train for really for an</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponent Fr Railey they,</v>

1073
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 4>the opponent is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a person.</v>

1074
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 4>He is a collection of skills and</v>
<v Speaker 4>attributes and a body type and that's</v>

1075
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:14.120
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we are training to get better every</v>

1076
00:46:14.121 --> 00:46:17.070
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The goal is to be better not to train</v>

1077
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and why is that a good thing among the</v>

1078
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:23.020
<v Speaker 4>millions of reasons Josie Aldos out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chad Mendez is in,</v>

1079
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.560
<v Speaker 4>if you spent all that time training for</v>
<v Speaker 4>Josie Aldo and only Josie,</v>

1080
00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 4>all Dell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1081
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 4>Chad Mendez in questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doubts,</v>

1082
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:32.070
<v Speaker 4>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing?</v>

1083
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Game Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>

1084
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter who it is.</v>

1085
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they train to get better every</v>

1086
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 4>single day in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1087
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 4>And that's okay.</v>

1088
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Great Mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can pull it off,</v>

1089
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.800
<v Speaker 3>he's pulling it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is pulling it off right now.</v>

1090
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much of what he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's able to do is his own unique</v>

1091
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 3>physical gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1092
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he's been so successful so</v>

1093
00:46:57.361 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 3>far with this strategy and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1094
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.970
<v Speaker 3>he know also the people that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>training with.</v>

1095
00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:04.770
<v Speaker 3>He's got it like fantastic training</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners,</v>

1096
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 3>great grappling with Gunnar Nelson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great coaching and why,</v>

1097
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what,</v>

1098
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that is the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I wonder is there going to come a</v>

1099
00:47:13.261 --> 00:47:15.900
<v Speaker 3>time where he faces another guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

1100
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 3>like a guy that on that level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe it's Hofeld does Angela,</v>

1101
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:20.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sent the breakdown in,</v>

1103
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that Craig at the UFC said it's good</v>

1104
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:29.090
<v Speaker 4>to God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they'll release it when their</v>

1105
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.940
<v Speaker 4>department does stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's coming out in the next day or</v>

1106
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.670
<v Speaker 4>breakdowns are fucking awesome,</v>

1109
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 4>eight to 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's of work on it.</v>

1110
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.740
<v Speaker 4>The ideas came over the last years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just,</v>

1111
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.440
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Craig and Dana and I were literally</v>

1122

<v Speaker 4>were talking.</v>

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.620
<v Speaker 4>It was really,</v>

<v Speaker 4>to be doing that for the UFC.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1128
00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:21.090
<v Speaker 3>when you first started doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we became friends and I would watch</v>

1129
00:48:21.091 --> 00:48:21.870
<v Speaker 3>your stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd,</v>

1130
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just immediately was saying like,</v>

1131
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:26.040
<v Speaker 3>why this guy should be doing this for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC.</v>

1132
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stuff is awesome.</v>

1133
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1134
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.830
<v Speaker 3>He puts so much thought into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much and now and you can get</v>

1135
00:48:31.831 --> 00:48:34.500
<v Speaker 3>so much out of it as a fan and someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

1136
00:48:34.501 --> 00:48:36.690
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fight is God damn apic.</v>

1137
00:48:36.691 --> 00:48:40.200
<v Speaker 3>This conor Mcgregor Hofeld dos Anjos</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight is an epic super fight.</v>

1138
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.730
<v Speaker 3>It's two champions in their prime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them coming off of a stunning 13</v>

1139
00:48:44.731 --> 00:48:48.360
<v Speaker 3>second knockout to win the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one coming off of a brutal</v>

1140
00:48:48.361 --> 00:48:50.490
<v Speaker 3>beat down of one of the most popular</v>
<v Speaker 3>contenders.</v>

1141
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean dos Anjos looks like a goddamned</v>
<v Speaker 3>murderer and connor looks like a freak.</v>

1142
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.160
<v Speaker 3>He does and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just these,</v>

1143
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.660
<v Speaker 3>these two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>

1144
00:48:57.661 --> 00:49:01.830
<v Speaker 3>It's the perfect fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to get some technical insight and to</v>

1145
00:49:01.831 --> 00:49:04.340
<v Speaker 3>get a view into what your thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't,</v>

1146
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:08.280
<v Speaker 3>footwork and movement and what dos Anjos</v>
<v Speaker 3>could possibly do to mitigate some of</v>

1147
00:49:08.281 --> 00:49:10.380
<v Speaker 3>that footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen if conor gets on</v>

1148
00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:14.610
<v Speaker 3>his back though way Mendez got him on</v>
<v Speaker 3>his back because dos Anjos is a lot</v>

1149
00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:17.850
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot stronger and dangerous as fuck</v>

1150
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.170
<v Speaker 4>with his submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1151
00:49:19.171 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 4>Chad Sephora really submitted people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guillotine bad,</v>

1152
00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:25.850
<v Speaker 4>but conard use that threat to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Chad was,</v>

1153
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Chad was two weeks for that fire plus</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the media obligations.</v>

1154
00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.530
<v Speaker 3>There is no way a guy who's got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling heavy strategy like Chad does,</v>

1155
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.710
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be conditioned</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to go five rounds if two with two</v>

1156
00:49:37.711 --> 00:49:40.710
<v Speaker 3>weeks he had to knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he went in hard and early he</v>

1157
00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.900
<v Speaker 3>pushed all his chips in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor's got a chin.</v>

1158
00:49:42.901 --> 00:49:46.170
<v Speaker 3>It's made out of some fucking the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that wolverines bones are made out</v>

1159
00:49:46.171 --> 00:49:47.070
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam Manteo.</v>

1160
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never seen anybody take a Chad Mendez</v>

1161
00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:51.474
<v Speaker 3>Punch to the face.</v>

1162
00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1163
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.420
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was getting hit with a right hand</v>

1164
00:49:56.421 --> 00:49:57.930
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was getting hit with it,</v>

1165
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.900
<v Speaker 4>whether or not now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1166
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:02.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does annual says a southpaw too,</v>

1167
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.740
<v Speaker 4>so it changes things and he has seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked out pour.</v>

1168
00:50:04.741 --> 00:50:07.280
<v Speaker 4>Ea was a south part and I think Brandao</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a southpaw too.</v>

1169
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:11.100
<v Speaker 4>So he's has dealt with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But on the other hand does Anjos took a</v>

1170
00:50:11.101 --> 00:50:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Ben Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 4>South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pedes switches.</v>

1172
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1173
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Jason High was a South Pollack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's face planning of us.</v>

1174
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:19.003
<v Speaker 4>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.330
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1176
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking that stuff down when I looked</v>

1177
00:50:23.241 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 4>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my real goal is to,</v>

1178
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.350
<v Speaker 4>to try to influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I feel watch fighting and to make</v>

1179
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 4>them see it the way that I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the actual goal.</v>

1180
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.810
<v Speaker 4>The goal is that I see this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable stuff happening underneath</v>

1181
00:50:38.331 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 4>some of the surface and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>entertain people long enough that I can</v>

1182
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 4>trick them into learning some of it.</v>

1183
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the plan.</v>

1184
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 4>And trick them into learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

1185
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.090
<v Speaker 4>You just want to entertain them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure they're having a good time.</v>

1186
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are walking around going the,</v>

1187
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.720
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kick works this way.</v>

1188
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 4>And they do it because if you go and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>just stand there and you're like,</v>

1189
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 4>have a diagram and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was,</v>

1190
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 4>there was always outside of like people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were learning,</v>

1191
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 4>fighting from your commentary and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wouldn't be another show.</v>

1192
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 4>So then they'd have to come back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd learned during the fights,</v>

1193
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.530
<v Speaker 4>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was your,</v>

1194
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 4>you did more to educate people by</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting than any person ever.</v>

1195
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1196
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I can't think off the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody who has</v>

1197
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 4>contributed more knowledge of fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was done.</v>

1198
00:51:23.391 --> 00:51:25.130
<v Speaker 4>You're entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're having fun.</v>

1199
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:26.900
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love your voice.</v>

1200
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.960
<v Speaker 4>So that was the learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there's not another fight now</v>

1201
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 4>for a few weeks live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should learn some shit in the</v>

1202
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 4>meantime and we should get you prepared</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have to teach them</v>

1203
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.490
<v Speaker 4>everything about this fight in the fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>while calling the fight and making shits</v>

1204
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.340
<v Speaker 4>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to get you prepped to a,</v>

1205
00:51:41.341 --> 00:51:42.174
<v Speaker 4>some knowledge.</v>

1206
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's never been a time like this</v>

1207
00:51:44.021 --> 00:51:46.750
<v Speaker 3>before where you could get so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>different breakdowns,</v>

1208
00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:50.230
<v Speaker 3>like the Gracie breakdowns of</v>
<v Speaker 3>submissions that a Henna and he,</v>

1209
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Ron Do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence Kanchan starts to Jack slap</v>

1210
00:51:53.681 --> 00:51:55.330
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much good.</v>

1211
00:51:55.331 --> 00:51:56.920
<v Speaker 3>So who's the guy that Kenny was</v>
<v Speaker 3>plagiarizing?</v>

1212
00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1213
00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name off the top of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1214
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a weird situation.</v>

1215
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you talk about that?</v>

1216
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.350
<v Speaker 3>Did you talk about that much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you are a guy who would not</v>

1217
00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:07.780
<v Speaker 3>happen in comedy do you were not having</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1218
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really a,</v>

1219
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.030
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1220
00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:13.480
<v Speaker 3>it would Kenny's take on it is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny,</v>

1221
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he writes a lot of notes and he's been</v>

1222
00:52:15.851 --> 00:52:17.980
<v Speaker 3>writing notes for years and years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1223
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:19.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>

1224
00:52:19.451 --> 00:52:21.490
<v Speaker 3>He just failed to attribute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1225
00:52:21.491 --> 00:52:22.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>may maybe the case,</v>

1226
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I liked the fact that,</v>

1228
00:52:25.961 --> 00:52:26.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found out.</v>

1229
00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 4>Lee Wiley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1231
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does great stuff.</v>

1232
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of really ugly pebble</v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

1233
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excellent.</v>

1234
00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's very good,</v>

1235
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot.</v>

1236
00:52:34.671 --> 00:52:39.671
<v Speaker 4>And when I was started to do analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a lot and I was hoping now,</v>

1237
00:52:40.821 --> 00:52:42.260
<v Speaker 4>just like when you started doing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

1238
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:43.940
<v Speaker 4>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had hundreds of people say,</v>

1239
00:52:43.941 --> 00:52:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I started a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1240
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 4>And just like I get guys emailing me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1241
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing an analysis and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I wasn't the guy who started it.</v>

1242
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:53.020
<v Speaker 4>I can't take any credit for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1243
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 4>but when people get it excitedly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were like,</v>

1244
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1245
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 4>Fighting is way more interesting than</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1246
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real thing that kind of would bother</v>

1247
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:05.130
<v Speaker 4>me is that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1248
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 4>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened,</v>

1249
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 4>this awesome stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

1250
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Crazy things that had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1251
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:13.040
<v Speaker 4>change the way that you understood how</v>
<v Speaker 4>people moved and what happened when</v>

1252
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:17.120
<v Speaker 4>trained athletes fought each other and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it meant something to him the next time</v>

1253
00:53:17.121 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 4>that you'd fight the way they move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff and then people would be</v>

1254
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:20.031
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1255
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 4>he got it done at two minutes or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fifth,</v>

1256
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two minutes of the third round.</v>

1257
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 4>What's next for this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is,</v>

1258
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 4>that's a great conversation to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or what does this mean for the title</v>

1259
00:53:28.201 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 4>rankings?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>

1260
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:33.480
<v Speaker 4>who are you going to call out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was incest instantly looking ahead,</v>

1261
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.190
<v Speaker 4>fighting immediately was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what's the next fight and how's it going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go down?</v>

1263
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 4>No amount of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does it mean,</v>

1264
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1265
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.560
<v Speaker 4>we're taking human beings at the highest</v>
<v Speaker 4>level of training and in a global</v>

1266
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 4>experiment to figure out what is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate way that human beings can do</v>

1267
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:53.100
<v Speaker 4>combat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're putting them there at personal</v>

1268
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:57.780
<v Speaker 4>risk to themselves for our entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 4>and brilliant shit happens.</v>

1269
00:53:57.781 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 4>We can't just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't just go,</v>

1270
00:53:59.491 --> 00:53:59.881
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>We got to honor that fight.</v>

1274
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 4>We've got to honor the fact that these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys are giving that stuff.</v>

1275
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:12.130

<v Speaker 3>I've never seen those.</v>

1288
00:54:39.951 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing Jujitsu for 22 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never seen some of those moves raise.</v>

1289
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.980
<v Speaker 3>He's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of these guys have like some sick</v>

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1293
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is a whole other fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 4>world of its own right now,</v>

1294
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.031
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1295
00:54:54.031 --> 00:54:59.031
<v Speaker 4>I just loved now that it's like it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the outcome or the storyline around</v>

1296
00:54:59.161 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 4>it or the shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are interested in the fight.</v>

1297
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Like the thing that's happening when</v>
<v Speaker 4>these geniuses are actually moving.</v>

1298
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 4>That just makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that's happening.</v>

1299
00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:09.881
<v Speaker 4>I'm so glad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:55:09.881 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 4>That's happening now because that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens in other sports too.</v>

1301
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 4>Eventually at first just got to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>homeruns man,</v>

1302
00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 4>we're just going to sit around until the</v>
<v Speaker 4>home runs happen.</v>

1303
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Or like what if you're in football?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who love football didn't</v>

1304
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.400
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just bored out of their tree</v>

1305
00:55:23.401 --> 00:55:27.360
<v Speaker 4>booing when they ran the football one</v>
<v Speaker 4>yard and they only chaired when it was</v>

1306
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:28.650
<v Speaker 4>like a long bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1307
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happened.</v>

1308
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.150
<v Speaker 4>To some degree in fighting guys will get</v>
<v Speaker 4>be against the fence or guys would be</v>

1309
00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 4>grappling and people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1310
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:37.670
<v Speaker 4>when is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fighting going to happen?</v>

1311
00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:38.491
<v Speaker 4>We still see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1312
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 4>we do.</v>

1313
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.170
<v Speaker 3>We still see that especially when we go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like different markets outside of</v>

1314
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Vegas and the audience is not that</v>
<v Speaker 3>educated and they start booing when it</v>

1315
00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:47.064
<v Speaker 3>goes to the ground.</v>

1316
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

1317
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sucks.</v>

1318
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I commentated taekwondo for the Pan Am</v>

1319
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:54.691
<v Speaker 4>Games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1320
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I connotated as like eight,</v>

1321
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.410
<v Speaker 4>maybe more like 10 or 12 traditional</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts in Russia for the world</v>

1322
00:56:01.411 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 4>combat games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1323
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:07.640
<v Speaker 4>And it's super cool and I'm just seeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Brazilian Jujitsu is moving the way</v>

1324
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.370
<v Speaker 4>that those sports moved in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

1325
00:56:11.371 --> 00:56:16.371
<v Speaker 4>Like taekwondo was awesome commentating</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and the Mexican team won almost all</v>

1326
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 4>the metals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1327
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can punch as we all know,</v>

1328
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 4>but we don't do it because our coaches</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way that we've taught and the</v>

1329
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 4>way we've celebrated the spinning and</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful techniques,</v>

1330
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1331
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 4>that space in between you and me being</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to kick each other from here.</v>

1332
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 4>The Mexican team entered that space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took it away and punched you in the body</v>

1333
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 4>and they want almost all in like body</v>
<v Speaker 4>punches,</v>

1334
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:45.640
<v Speaker 4>body punches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one almost cost and it's like the sport</v>

1335
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 4>itself kind of agrees to do taekwondo</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that happens in every sport and in</v>

1336
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu.</v>

1337
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Now I love Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sports,</v>

1338
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu isn't really fighting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this bear and Bolo and all these</v>

1339
00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 4>interesting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're beautiful.</v>

1340
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:05.460
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating and amazing sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we are in an environment where we</v>

1341
00:57:05.461 --> 00:57:10.150
<v Speaker 4>are going to sort of unconsciously agree</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these are there structures and</v>

1342
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 4>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have the sport changes as soon as you</v>

1343
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 4>remove punching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of these things,</v>

1344
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 4>certain defenses to things as punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once we remove that you get this</v>

1345
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 4>beautiful cool sport but it moves</v>
<v Speaker 4>further away from fighting the same way</v>

1346
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 4>every other martial art did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

1347
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.180
<v Speaker 3>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also doesn't have to like what</v>

1348
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:29.440
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I really love about</v>

1349
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:32.890
<v Speaker 3>what John Danaher is doing with Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Commons and Gary Tonin and these,</v>

1350
00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 3>these assassins that he's got out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hens Zos in New York,</v>

1351
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 3>is they're figuring out a way to use</v>
<v Speaker 3>these leg lock transitions in a way that</v>

1352
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not dangerous to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you would always,</v>

1353
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 3>the traditional thought was when a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes for a leg and if you do it</v>

1354
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 3>improperly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the truth.</v>

1355
00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 3>You're committing to arms to the leg and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna be able to defend</v>

1356
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:54.490
<v Speaker 3>against punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw that with Frank Mir versus Ian,</v>

1357
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.331
<v Speaker 3>the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freeman.</v>

1358
00:57:55.331 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Remember that fight frank was gone for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that heel hook and Ian just kept</v>

1359
00:57:59.111 --> 00:58:01.420
<v Speaker 3>punching him in the fucking face and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1360
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 3>and they stopped him while he wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>tapping and he's just slamming him in</v>

1361
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:05.810
<v Speaker 3>the face when</v>

1362
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Alan Belcher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was fighting,</v>

1363
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.450
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Harris.</v>

1364
00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see that anymore.</v>

1365
00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:12.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1366
00:58:12.391 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 3>the highest level Jujitsu guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put,</v>

1367
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:15.700
<v Speaker 3>they're putting themselves in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1368
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a guy like gary tonin or eddie</v>

1369
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:22.240
<v Speaker 3>cummings grabs a hold of your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have fractions of a second before</v>

1370
00:58:22.241 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 3>your knee explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>

1371
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transitions and the technique is so</v>

1372
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have that space to swing wild</v>

1373
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:31.470
<v Speaker 3>punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not giving it to,</v>

1374
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:35.020
<v Speaker 3>they are putting you in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous spot immediately.</v>

1375
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's the technique and the thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>process behind it and whether it's</v>

1376
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:40.150
<v Speaker 3>perfected by Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1377
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know dean lister was initially a part</v>

1378
00:58:42.881 --> 00:58:45.310
<v Speaker 3>of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He taught those guys a lot and he was</v>

1379
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:47.980
<v Speaker 3>one of the early leg lock masters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys are,</v>

1380
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it in a way where these</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques that I might've agreed with</v>

1381
00:58:52.421 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 3>you just a few years ago really aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>for mma,</v>

1382
00:58:55.211 --> 00:58:57.070
<v Speaker 3>like the 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 and stuff like that.</v>

1383
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing those really applied MMA</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1384
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cool thing about the cool thing</v>

1385
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:05.040
<v Speaker 4>about fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything is cool,</v>

1386
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1387
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:12.000
<v Speaker 4>but a another and a long list of cool</v>
<v Speaker 4>things is,</v>

1388
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:15.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's how the money that exists.</v>

1389
00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.310
<v Speaker 4>Like when we talk about why the UFC is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>great thing.</v>

1390
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I think that UFC is an awesome thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you monetize something more study</v>

1391
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 4>and things happen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as,</v>

1392
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you say you can become</v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthy,</v>

1393
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 4>if you get good at this gyms and</v>
<v Speaker 4>businesses and things can pop up around</v>

1394
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:34.670
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's speeds the evolution of how things</v>

1395
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1396
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:41.770
<v Speaker 4>because Emma May exist as a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid for doing fighting it.</v>

1397
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 4>W uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys like Danaher will arc back with</v>

1398
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:48.080
<v Speaker 4>their study of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the martial art back to where they</v>

1399
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:50.660
<v Speaker 4>get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fighting the UFC.</v>

1400
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because you need a guy</v>

1401
00:59:52.691 --> 00:59:55.960
<v Speaker 3>like a Donna her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need one of those genius guys to</v>

1402
00:59:55.961 --> 00:59:58.960
<v Speaker 3>just try to figure out what's the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to approach this.</v>

1403
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Where are the problems?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1404
01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.700
<v Speaker 3>the problems keep happening happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're going into the,</v>

1405
01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.650
<v Speaker 3>the transition and the guy grabs this</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg.</v>

1406
01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we stop that?</v>

1407
01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at it backwards.</v>

1408
01:00:08.351 --> 01:00:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's attack it from this side.</v>

1409
01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Now we're going to attack it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like so many times when a guys would go</v>

1410
01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:18.600
<v Speaker 3>for an arm bar from side control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be inside control or you be an</v>

1411
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.050
<v Speaker 3>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had grabbed an arm,</v>

1412
01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:23.620
<v Speaker 3>you'd swing over and you'd go and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>commit to that arm and then the legs</v>

1413
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 3>would fly over for the DNS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1414
01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo was one of the first guys to</v>

1415
01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:28.781
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1416
01:00:28.781 --> 01:00:31.870
<v Speaker 3>let's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not hook it with the right arm</v>

1417
01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:32.220
<v Speaker 3>saved.</v>

1418
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.980
<v Speaker 3>You're going for someone's right arm and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you turn a Rmr them.</v>

1419
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Don't Hook it with your right arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hug with the left and grabbed their leg.</v>

1420
01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did your other arm and then commit to it</v>

1421
01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:45.340
<v Speaker 3>that way because this way you've stopped</v>
<v Speaker 3>the defense and you've got a much more</v>

1422
01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:48.910
<v Speaker 3>secure set of a offense and the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why people were going</v>

1423
01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.400
<v Speaker 3>for it in the first place was because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gate.</v>

1424
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The keys are really interesting thing</v>

1425
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:57.940
<v Speaker 3>because I think the GE is very good</v>
<v Speaker 3>defensively and I think defensively it's</v>

1426
01:00:57.941 --> 01:01:01.510
<v Speaker 3>one of the best tools to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you using proper technique because you</v>

1427
01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:04.750
<v Speaker 3>can't just explode out of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to use the right position.</v>

1428
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:06.640
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand where your day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're in danger,</v>

1429
01:01:06.641 --> 01:01:08.410
<v Speaker 3>when you're not in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1430
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.230
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to attacking the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you so many more,</v>

1431
01:01:11.231 --> 01:01:13.420
<v Speaker 3>handles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many more options and I think it's</v>

1432
01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:18.310
<v Speaker 3>false security and I think you're way</v>
<v Speaker 3>better off not using it to attack.</v>

1433
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a whole other part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sport too.</v>

1435
01:01:22.181 --> 01:01:26.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like you roll with these gay guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like sneaking this thing out</v>

1436
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

1437
01:01:27.221 --> 01:01:29.710
<v Speaker 4>what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now nevermind the fact that that's</v>

1438
01:01:29.711 --> 01:01:33.070
<v Speaker 4>going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just introducing that threat and you're</v>

1439
01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:33.701
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wait,</v>

1440
01:01:33.701 --> 01:01:36.280
<v Speaker 4>what's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now my brain isn't mindful where it's</v>

1441
01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:37.840
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's worried about this,</v>

1442
01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:40.060
<v Speaker 4>which might be nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just pulling a piece of ag.</v>

1443
01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.440
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is fascinating.</v>

1444
01:01:41.441 --> 01:01:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Any kind of combat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any way that you put two people trying</v>

1445
01:01:45.131 --> 01:01:47.080
<v Speaker 4>to best each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be absolutely</v>

1446
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.120
<v Speaker 3>key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys are doing some weird shit,</v>

1447
01:01:49.121 --> 01:01:50.530
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're like taking their jacket</v>

1448
01:01:50.531 --> 01:01:52.760
<v Speaker 3>off and wrap it around your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangling you</v>

1449
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:55.800
<v Speaker 4>exact stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're really going to use this thing if</v>

1450
01:01:55.801 --> 01:01:56.670
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be in there.</v>

1451
01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:00.780
<v Speaker 4>But fighting too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like even how'd you Jitsu is used</v>

1452
01:02:00.781 --> 01:02:04.080
<v Speaker 4>in fighting changes so much in such</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting ways,</v>

1453
01:02:04.081 --> 01:02:08.070
<v Speaker 4>in ways that we've now seen happen over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over so many times that you can</v>

1454
01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:10.110
<v Speaker 4>predict their future again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1455
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.243
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1456
01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one example that I always kind of</v>

1457
01:02:13.891 --> 01:02:15.780
<v Speaker 4>used is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1458
01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm in your guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I do a can opener and then your guard</v>

1459
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 4>opens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1460
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 4>And then you discover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1461
01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 4>wait a second alarm bar that and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>armbar me.</v>

1462
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:26.460
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your guard can open,</v>

1463
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 4>opens your guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second,</v>

1464
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:29.910
<v Speaker 4>you armbar me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more can openers.</v>

1465
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.210
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any fucking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Danaher later it goes,</v>

1466
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.250
<v Speaker 4>George,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to Kent.</v>

1467
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Open a conduit of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the dental her,</v>

1468
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do a good French accent,</v>

1469
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 4>but what about the arm bar we're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to can open him and shut down the arm</v>

1470
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 4>bar.</v>

1471
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.170
<v Speaker 4>We don't stop cat opening cause there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>an orb are there.</v>

1472
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.500
<v Speaker 4>We just solve the problem and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of adjustment.</v>

1473
01:02:49.501 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 4>You see it now in the guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it blows my mind that in Jim's</v>

1474
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:57.120
<v Speaker 4>every west very smart coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like the guard is dead.</v>

1475
01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 4>We don't submit from the guard anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We use the guard.</v>

1476
01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:03.030
<v Speaker 4>What's Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck there's lots of good guys or</v>

1477
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:08.031
<v Speaker 4>tell you as a monster jam Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But think of the implications of that.</v>

1478
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where I see the crazy aspect of</v>

1479
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 4>it because we've seen this a million</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1480
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.040
<v Speaker 4>So all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to submit from God are</v>

1481
01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:20.130
<v Speaker 4>our use when we are in guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to use it to get an under</v>

1482
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 4>hook threatened one of these three</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and Heisler hips back out.</v>

1483
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:26.130
<v Speaker 4>And we're going to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to work on our standup more</v>

1484
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 4>for here.</v>

1485
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 4>We're going to get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay coach,</v>

1486
01:03:28.801 --> 01:03:31.740
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now for the next year and a half,</v>

1487
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 4>your job on top of me becomes hold me</v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

1488
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:39.720
<v Speaker 4>stop my stand up and hit me at my job</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes fight you to get back up.</v>

1489
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.580
<v Speaker 4>That happens for three months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six months,</v>

1490
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 4>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That becomes the game.</v>

1491
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 4>You hold me down and beat me up and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried to get back to my feet.</v>

1492
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Your game on top hasn't even involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real threat of submissions for two</v>

1493
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 4>fucking years because all your training</v>
<v Speaker 4>partners had just standing up.</v>

1494
01:03:56.250 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 4>So your getting weaker at stealing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>submission threats cause you never see</v>

1495
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:02.670
<v Speaker 4>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your trading partners don't do them</v>

1496
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.570
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in Andy's Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got Ben Saunders and guys,</v>

1497
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 4>they're working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only are they getting better at it,</v>

1498
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 4>you're getting worse at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As time goes on,</v>

1499
01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 4>you're getting worse at it.</v>

1500
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 4>Inevitably all of a sudden it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guards back in play.</v>

1501
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody submit and guys off their</v>

1502
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why he got better,</v>

1503
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 4>but you got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mindset of how to train that thing</v>

1504
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 4>in the gym every day removed a very real</v>
<v Speaker 4>threat because your training partners</v>

1505
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.180
<v Speaker 4>don't even throw it at you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that thing changes,</v>

1506
01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:30.780
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.000
<v Speaker 4>You see that also with wrestlers that</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't wrestle much anymore because of</v>

1508
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:36.590
<v Speaker 4>working on their striking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We kind of put the wrestling side and</v>

1509
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 4>then they'd get out rustled and you was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1510
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.280
<v Speaker 4>that's something you've got to stay on</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of.</v>

1511
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.110
<v Speaker 4>You got to keep sharpening it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 4>There's just so many different variables</v>
<v Speaker 4>in mma.</v>

1513
01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why it's such an</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing sport.</v>

1514
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different ways to go</v>

1515
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1516
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 4>you can just decide to Damien Maia it</v>
<v Speaker 4>close the distance kicked guys,</v>

1517
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 4>the ground user superior do you do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>submit guys and you know,</v>

1518
01:04:57.181 --> 01:05:00.600
<v Speaker 4>look like a wizard or you can wonderboy</v>
<v Speaker 4>it where you're just standing.</v>

1519
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean poor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an interesting fight,</v>

1520
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damien Maia and wonderboy,</v>

1521
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.960
<v Speaker 4>that is a very fucking interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if that ever happens,</v>

1522
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1523
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 4>for um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1524
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.200
<v Speaker 4>Ramdane and I has my partner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you met him at a show.</v>

1525
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 4>We commentate a bunch of really old</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights and it's really cool.</v>

1526
01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Well that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All pancreas.</v>

1527
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.910
<v Speaker 4>We just did a couple of conduits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old fights against,</v>

1528
01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a uh,</v>

1529
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 4>issue membering names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1530
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:26.700
<v Speaker 4>It's cause I got hit in the head a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>for real.</v>

1531
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it was like the drugs.</v>

1532
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four days or heroin.</v>

1533
01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1534
01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:34.000
<v Speaker 4>I literally was thinking of that on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way down here.</v>

1535
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

1536
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>

1537
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 4>old fights and you see how different it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1538
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Like you can spot the things where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1539
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 4>now a guy would not do that or he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>

1540
01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just didn't know.</v>

1541
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:50.790
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think it's crazy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting is so structured in how it's</v>

1542
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 4>trained now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1543
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.650
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's put it this way,</v>

1544
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 4>2000 in 2030 does fighting look</v>
<v Speaker 4>different than it does today?</v>

1545
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then why are we training it?</v>

1546
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Like it isn't changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why,</v>

1547
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:06.940
<v Speaker 4>if we know that it is ever changing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are we like digging in deep and</v>

1548
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.840
<v Speaker 4>saying we got it all figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1549
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:11.140
<v Speaker 4>you got to train your white tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to train and just kind of</v>

1550
01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 4>resting and gotta because someone will</v>
<v Speaker 4>come along.</v>

1551
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:14.500
<v Speaker 4>That's what taxis dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1552
01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 4>that's what hotels did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like hotels.</v>

1553
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 4>So this is the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to build bigger hotels,</v>

1554
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:21.000
<v Speaker 4>better hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll put pools in them.</v>

1555
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:21.461
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1556
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.930
<v Speaker 4>we'll advertise them differently in</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

1557
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:24.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like people don't want to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>hotels.</v>

1558
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:29.910
<v Speaker 4>It's airbnb comes along ruins hotels</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the really ruining ozone,</v>

<v Speaker 4>tons and tons of people just don't even</v>

1561
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:39.070
<v Speaker 4>consider it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I was coming down to La for the</v>

1562
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 4>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at how expensive hotels,</v>

1563
01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:44.410
<v Speaker 4>where I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really want to stay in someone's</v>

1564
01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Although I have friends who do it all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>now that that's in my head</v>

1588
01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.290
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you think about the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody spying on you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>someone could remotely watch you in your</v>

1594
01:07:42.901 --> 01:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>own home.</v>

1595
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be,</v>

1596
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 10 20 years ago if they wanted to</v>

1597

<v Speaker 1>do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to like set up some pretty</v>

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:52.290
<v Speaker 1>elaborate equipment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It can remotely access it.</v>

1601
01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.350
<v Speaker 1>You have a bunch of different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras they can remotely access share</v>

1602
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>freaky that each mass outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>

1603
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.910
<v Speaker 4>When you think about any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>technology can use it for good,</v>

1605
01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:12.090
<v Speaker 4>you can use it to like a fat things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use it to make things better.</v>

1606
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 4>You can use it for bad and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a perspective thing.</v>

1607
01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 4>I think with the way that we look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1608
01:08:20.061 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that people look at things,</v>

1609
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:24.410
<v Speaker 4>it's like the perspective that you take</v>
<v Speaker 4>is everything.</v>

1610
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you look at something,</v>

1611
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.630
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody says something to you,</v>

1612
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 4>you and you give all this meaning to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you assume you know what they mean</v>

1613
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.690
<v Speaker 4>and then you get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to do that.</v>

1614
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.920
<v Speaker 4>You can like just assign it no meaning</v>
<v Speaker 4>at all and have whatever response you</v>

1615
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That kind of perspective is you come</v>

1616
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:44.360
<v Speaker 4>across a camera and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well wouldn't this be cool?</v>

1617
01:08:44.361 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 4>We can like film guys training and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can like come up with all these cool</v>

1618
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do my job different.</v>

1619
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Or somebody like naked people without</v>
<v Speaker 4>their permission.</v>

1620
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:53.680
<v Speaker 4>That's where we got it.</v>

1621
01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just assholes.</v>

1622
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to have assholes,</v>

1623
01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1624
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:03.100
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about like fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>today versus fighting 30 years from now.</v>

1625
01:09:03.101 --> 01:09:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we train like it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years from now.</v>

1626
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the problems is we need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to see it be successful.</v>

1627
01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you need to see a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy fight.</v>

1628
01:09:10.691 --> 01:09:11.441
<v Speaker 3>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1629
01:09:11.441 --> 01:09:13.960
<v Speaker 3>okay we got to learn some fucking sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>karate.</v>

1630
01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.730
<v Speaker 3>We've got to figure out how to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>blitz.</v>

1631
01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:18.400
<v Speaker 3>We got to figure out how to slide back</v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw those kicks the way they're</v>

1632
01:09:18.401 --> 01:09:20.830
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I still to this day thing,</v>

1633
01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.820
<v Speaker 3>we haven't seen the level of traditional</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts techniques that are,</v>

1634
01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 3>that exist in like a really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>taekwondo match or really good kill</v>

1635
01:09:29.571 --> 01:09:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Kachin match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are guys in these other sports,</v>

1636
01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen some guys like a moon toss</v>

1637
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:37.930
<v Speaker 3>re who's fighting the EOC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a national champion.</v>

1638
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker with his kicks.</v>

1639
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.970
<v Speaker 3>So you seeing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1640
01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:44.710
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to learn all that other stuff</v>

1641
01:09:44.711 --> 01:09:46.270
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to get me,</v>

1642
01:09:46.271 --> 01:09:48.130
<v Speaker 3>had to rather learn all that other stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

1643
01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:49.660
<v Speaker 3>get better at all these other</v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques.</v>

1644
01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.090
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps there's,</v>

1645
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.360
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be some guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>even better and more powerful than him.</v>

1646
01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1647
01:09:56.210 --> 01:10:01.210
<v Speaker 3>that these traditional techniques I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think are probably the most underused or</v>

1648
01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:05.650
<v Speaker 3>the most underappreciated aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mma.</v>

1649
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we saw Anderson Front kick Vitorin</v>

1650
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.710
<v Speaker 3>the face and there was like the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time we'd ever seen that,</v>

1651
01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:14.470
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy that the first kick ever</v>

1652
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.260
<v Speaker 3>that they teach you is now the new kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you had boss on earlier and I</v>

1654
01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:22.870
<v Speaker 4>didn't get to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love bus and he used to say straight</v>

1655
01:10:22.871 --> 01:10:24.220
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no jabs,</v>

1656
01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.980
<v Speaker 4>jabs in fighting a useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that was a different era.</v>

1657
01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 4>Now he would say something different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1658
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:32.560
<v Speaker 4>But he was the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were products of Erez and then that</v>

1659
01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.210
<v Speaker 4>other era,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we can't front kick.</v>

1660
01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Well why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we will get taken down.</v>

1661
01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well don't get taken down.</v>

1662
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Let's just like that crown opener and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the arm bar if you get taken to or</v>

1663
01:10:43.391 --> 01:10:46.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever the issue was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But say the issue is getting taken down.</v>

1664
01:10:46.091 --> 01:10:47.800
<v Speaker 4>If you get taken down off the front</v>
<v Speaker 4>kick,</v>

1665
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean don't front kick it</v>
<v Speaker 4>means front kick and figure out how to</v>

1666
01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:52.150
<v Speaker 4>stop the fact that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1667
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what the guys who are really good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that front kick.</v>

1668
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:59.010
<v Speaker 3>It's such a danger like Kyle noke when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went to fight in Australia.</v>

1669
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are some,</v>

1670
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 4>I swear some of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1671
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Shane Campbell's fighting I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sunday.</v>

1672
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's got a few finishes with their</v>

1673
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 4>toe stabs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think some of the ones I keep</v>

1674
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 4>pointing of this connor doll cause it</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks funny.</v>

1675
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:12.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

1676
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 4>I think of the ones that hit Mendez</v>
<v Speaker 4>worth,</v>

1677
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 4>we're toast abs and just roll the toes</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and drill them in.</v>

1678
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're saying like roll the toes back</v>

1679
01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 4>down instead of pulling instead of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling it back like with the ball of</v>

1680
01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:24.690
<v Speaker 4>your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like taekwondo,</v>

1681
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.810
<v Speaker 4>make him like a fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're all them and then they stab</v>

1682
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:28.940
<v Speaker 4>it into the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's void.</v>

1683
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Todd and all tie technique.</v>

1684
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you Google Shane Campbell tow stab,</v>

1685
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 4>you'll probably see one that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of his fights right before I got in</v>

1686
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:38.540
<v Speaker 4>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but lots of,</v>

1687
01:11:38.541 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I bet some of them are doing that now.</v>

1688
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 4>The ball of the foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can penetrate pretty deep.</v>

1689
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.600
<v Speaker 4>But when they commit to like literally</v>
<v Speaker 4>drilling it in and it penetrates in and</v>

1690
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 4>touches your organs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the meat they gets to me,</v>

1691
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:53.850
<v Speaker 4>those that I feel like I can kick</v>
<v Speaker 4>through a door with a ball of my foot.</v>

1692
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 4>That's your lifetime toe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be able to have that</v>

1693
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:00.600
<v Speaker 4>kind of impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do that toast tab and you hit an elbow,</v>

1694
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.610
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of fucks Ville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1695
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's the risk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the reason you can do that as you</v>

1696
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 4>did it since you were a little kid over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over thousands and thousands of</v>

1697
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:12.300
<v Speaker 4>times and it is harder and it is safer</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is smarter.</v>

1698
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.880
<v Speaker 4>But if you know that that spot is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1699
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.170
<v Speaker 4>all of these things have to be the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>answers.</v>

1700
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Cause with the next answer isn't just do</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we're all doing only better.</v>

1701
01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.213
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1702
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.020
<v Speaker 4>and it was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1703
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:28.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was it?</v>

1704
01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1705
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hughes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his coach.</v>

1706
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.440
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that pub meal.</v>

1707
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Military,</v>

1708
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 4>military and frank shamrock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these guys were like,</v>

1709
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.780
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you were a wrestler and I was a</v>

1710
01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 4>striker and that's all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got to get really pretty good at</v>

1711
01:12:43.111 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 4>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That worked for awhile.</v>

1712
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 4>But now that everybody knows every</v>
<v Speaker 4>single choice that you're making,</v>

1713
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.120
<v Speaker 4>every single position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1714
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.090
<v Speaker 4>we're just playing within these rules</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've kind of agreed on.</v>

1715
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be some other stuff we got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be things that you don't</v>

1716
01:12:56.761 --> 01:12:58.260
<v Speaker 4>train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be things you haven't dealt</v>

1717
01:12:58.261 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be thinks your training</v>

1718
01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:02.190
<v Speaker 4>partners don't show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That has to be the next answer.</v>

1719
01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.350
<v Speaker 4>It has to always be the next answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1720
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.590
<v Speaker 4>I think movement is the big focus right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1721
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:08.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1722
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.160
<v Speaker 4>With Ido and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all these are when Irwin Liqour,</v>

1723
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:18.750
<v Speaker 4>nick curse on focuses a lot on movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of plyometrics and explosion</v>

1724
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:20.190
<v Speaker 4>drills and movements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

1725
01:13:20.191 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 4>And I think they're realizing now that w</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the glue in between the</v>

1726
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:27.510
<v Speaker 4>techniques is what would the really</v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on.</v>

1727
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:30.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a big factor in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks,</v>

1728
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:32.610
<v Speaker 4>wonderboy Thompson fire for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the movement,</v>

1729
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 4>the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1730
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:34.201
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1731
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:37.020
<v Speaker 4>the fact that hendricks is so much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>stationary.</v>

1732
01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:40.340
<v Speaker 4>He just really wasn't able to close</v>
<v Speaker 4>those distances or get out of the way.</v>

1733
01:13:40.341 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 4>It didn't have that kind of footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his game was just so dependent upon</v>

1734
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:46.320
<v Speaker 4>close range fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:47.070
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1736
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of hoped he would trade in the</v>

1737
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 4>pocket with me more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why the fuck would he do that?</v>

1738
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 4>He shouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should definitely not do that.</v>

1739
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of hoped he would fall down.</v>

1740
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>

1741
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.370
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I know why Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started doing that,</v>

1742
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.410
<v Speaker 4>that movement training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be wrong.</v>

1743
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hopefully get the chance to</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask him.</v>

1744
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 4>But you remember the last time that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was here,</v>

1745
01:14:09.331 --> 01:14:11.380
<v Speaker 4>we talked about that flow state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1746
01:14:11.381 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 4>when you achieve that flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best guys are fighting that a</v>

1747
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 4>hundred hundred percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there that state of freedom,</v>

1748
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:20.440
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And condit was one of the first guys I</v>

1749
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:24.250
<v Speaker 4>really spotted that Kinda did that</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier before we chat about last time.</v>

1750
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:27.310
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're seeing that a lot when you're</v>

1751
01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:30.460
<v Speaker 4>in a true flow state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are free,</v>

1752
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:33.550
<v Speaker 4>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to do things you weren't aware of,</v>

1753
01:14:33.551 --> 01:14:36.190
<v Speaker 4>fully present in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all of these things.</v>

1754
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:41.280
<v Speaker 4>It's about sort of true freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he believed that his body,</v>

1755
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.900
<v Speaker 4>he was his mind and it the thing has</v>
<v Speaker 4>goals were freer than his body was</v>

1756
01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 4>allowing him to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if he was truly mentally free to</v>

1757
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 4>fight that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that was stopping him was his</v>

1758
01:14:53.891 --> 01:14:58.000
<v Speaker 4>physical movement limitations and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>really believe that's why he went and</v>

1759
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:00.550
<v Speaker 4>pursued that kind of open movement</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're not going to become any</v>

1760
01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 4>freer than in a peak performance state.</v>

1761
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 4>So we have to free up our body if we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go further with this.</v>

1762
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense if you look at what</v>

1763
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:08.770
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well George,</v>

1764
01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Saint Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot of ways was ahead of the</v>

1765
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:13.810
<v Speaker 3>curve with this because of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>gymnastics approach,</v>

1766
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 3>but really the originator of the shit is</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Hixon.</v>

1767
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:21.610
<v Speaker 3>If you go back and watch Hixon when</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hickson was into the movement was</v>

1768
01:15:21.611 --> 01:15:23.020
<v Speaker 3>gymnastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unnatural Gal.</v>

1769
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 3>He was in a lot of like crazy yoga</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1770
01:15:25.631 --> 01:15:29.350
<v Speaker 3>a lot of flexibility and balance things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was into that way,</v>

1771
01:15:29.351 --> 01:15:30.540
<v Speaker 3>way before anybody right</v>

1772
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:34.940
<v Speaker 4>was and personally was into building the</v>
<v Speaker 4>body to do martial arts too.</v>

1773
01:15:34.941 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 4>In whatever ways you can figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were just saying it half an hour</v>

1774
01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:39.620
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how long it's been,</v>

1775
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:41.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1776
01:15:41.031 --> 01:15:42.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tell Jujitsu guys,</v>

1777
01:15:42.831 --> 01:15:47.210
<v Speaker 4>you got to get strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You identified that and identified that</v>

1778
01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:48.500
<v Speaker 4>all that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1779
01:15:48.501 --> 01:15:50.390
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we figured out how we're going to move</v>

1780
01:15:50.391 --> 01:15:51.260
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what do I,</v>

1781
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.230
<v Speaker 4>what can I do with my body to enhance</v>
<v Speaker 4>that or take that further?</v>

1782
01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 4>Eddie with his flexibility's yes.</v>

1783
01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Hickson was always the best out of</v>

1784
01:15:57.981 --> 01:15:59.040
<v Speaker 3>all of the gracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1785
01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:01.640
<v Speaker 3>he's widely regarded as the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu artist ever.</v>

1786
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at Hixson in comparison</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all the other ones,</v>

1787
01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:05.960
<v Speaker 3>like hoist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was fighting,</v>

1788
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:10.430
<v Speaker 3>what was so impressive about hoists was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't a specimen and he was</v>

1789
01:16:10.431 --> 01:16:12.860
<v Speaker 3>just a regular guy who was in shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1790
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 3>but had really good technique would</v>
<v Speaker 3>hixon is,</v>

1791
01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:18.890
<v Speaker 3>is that really good technique with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>freak athletic body,</v>

1792
01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.521
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1793
01:16:19.521 --> 01:16:23.060
<v Speaker 3>a guy who can stand on a balance beam</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do a full split holding onto his</v>

1794
01:16:23.061 --> 01:16:24.440
<v Speaker 3>heel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1795
01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:27.200
<v Speaker 3>he's really freakish in his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>move his body.</v>

1796
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.340
<v Speaker 3>And physical strength was a huge factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his ability as well.</v>

1797
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:35.210
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at Hixson in the old days</v>
<v Speaker 3>in comparison to the other guys,</v>

1798
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing a much more physically</v>
<v Speaker 3>robust guy,</v>

1799
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:41.480
<v Speaker 3>much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

1800
01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:44.360
<v Speaker 3>he was able to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you get two guys,</v>

1801
01:16:44.361 --> 01:16:47.090
<v Speaker 3>they both have equal technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one guy is much stronger,</v>

1802
01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:50.000
<v Speaker 3>that guy's gonna dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's just the way it is.</v>

1803
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:52.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technique is hugely important.</v>

1804
01:16:52.011 --> 01:16:55.280
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once that's covered,</v>

1805
01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.400
<v Speaker 3>physical strength is a huge attribute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

1806
01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Then the physical strength becomes equal</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1807
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:04.020
<v Speaker 4>So then flag warning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes flexibility and</v>

1808
01:17:04.021 --> 01:17:05.340
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone that's equal,</v>

1809
01:17:05.341 --> 01:17:07.420
<v Speaker 4>it's just our minds like who's gun?</v>

1810
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.000
<v Speaker 3>More creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more creative.</v>

1811
01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Who's more in the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's more loose,</v>

1812
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:13.160
<v Speaker 3>who can pull the trigger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easier.</v>

1813
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Psychological training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge factor.</v>

1814
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys are getting into hypnosis</v>

1815
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:19.700
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1816
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got hypnotized.</v>

1817
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.030

01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 3>what is hypnosis is trying to fight it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1829
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:43.791
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1830
01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to do that.</v>

1831
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want him to him to hypnotize me.</v>

1832
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:47.840
<v Speaker 3>See what it's like.</v>

1833
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:51.680
<v Speaker 3>You definitely go into a state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd definitely go into some strange</v>

1834
01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 3>state of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say you're asleep because a,</v>

1835
01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard him talking,</v>

1836
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

1837
01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing Vinnie's voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was most certainly hypnotized.</v>

1838
01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was definitely there,</v>

1839
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1840
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:07.070
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going into like a,</v>

1841
01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:11.270
<v Speaker 3>almost like a drug induced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels real weird.</v>

1842
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>That's what I felt like for four days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that quite that bad,</v>

1843
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1844
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.080
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

1845
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:20.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a very strange state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1846
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1847
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to describe it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>compare it to something else because I</v>

1848
01:18:24.111 --> 01:18:28.310
<v Speaker 3>don't think I've ever experienced</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like it other than maybe a</v>

1849
01:18:28.311 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 3>state that you get into sometimes when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing like a sensory deprivation</v>

1850
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:35.090
<v Speaker 3>tank or I guess you would do if you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing like heavy meditation,</v>

1851
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 3>you get into some weird alternative</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of consciousness.</v>

1852
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1854
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.080
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm visualizing training,</v>

1855
01:18:44.081 --> 01:18:45.130
<v Speaker 4>but with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1856
01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.173
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1857
01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>coaches wouldn't call themselves a</v>

1858
01:18:49.151 --> 01:18:50.620
<v Speaker 4>hypnotist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they lead it.</v>

1859
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.740
<v Speaker 4>So they lead you through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got your eyes closed and David,</v>

1860
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1861
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:57.400
<v Speaker 4>does it with some of the spg guys and</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people and he says,</v>

1862
01:18:57.401 --> 01:18:59.500
<v Speaker 4>you apps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're getting them to go through and</v>

1863
01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.060
<v Speaker 4>visualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see them moving,</v>

1864
01:19:01.061 --> 01:19:05.350
<v Speaker 4>you see them sweating like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are experiencing the fight in their</v>

1865
01:19:05.351 --> 01:19:07.660
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are visualizing everything and it's</v>

1866
01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:11.830
<v Speaker 4>probably very similar and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you lead you through it and at the</v>

1867
01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:14.170
<v Speaker 4>end they feel tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel mentally tire.</v>

1868
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.000
<v Speaker 4>They feel they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done it.</v>

1869
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:19.660
<v Speaker 4>And that that idea that you visualize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we do something,</v>

1870
01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:23.530
<v Speaker 4>our brain is doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if we don't physically do it,</v>

1871
01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:26.770
<v Speaker 4>but our brain does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely get huge real true value</v>

1872
01:19:26.771 --> 01:19:27.100
<v Speaker 4>from it.</v>

1873
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Well it's been proven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been proven that people can improve</v>

1874
01:19:29.471 --> 01:19:33.760
<v Speaker 3>as much through visualization as they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can from actual physical movement is as</v>

1875
01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:36.190
<v Speaker 3>long as you actually commit to it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1876
01:19:36.191 --> 01:19:39.840
<v Speaker 3>don't be all fucking weird and like half</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and you know,</v>

1877
01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:43.270
<v Speaker 3>you have to think of it as if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it and if you can think of it as</v>

1878
01:19:43.271 --> 01:19:46.120
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind will take those same pathways.</v>

1879
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.420
<v Speaker 3>I know that guys have learned new</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu techniques that way.</v>

1880
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you visualize yourself pulling them off</v>

1881
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:54.730
<v Speaker 3>and then when you're training they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just come.</v>

1882
01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.600
<v Speaker 3>They just come to you.</v>

1883
01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That just shows you what your brain can</v>

1884
01:19:58.101 --> 01:19:59.840
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why it is the most important part.</v>

1885
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:01.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the time we've learned how to do</v>

1886
01:20:01.641 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fight and you're walking</v>

1887
01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:07.340
<v Speaker 4>down there and if you haven't prepared</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally,</v>

1888
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:11.010
<v Speaker 4>everything else was always to time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can't go in there and be at an</v>

1889
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 4>optimum state free of the worrying about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the consequences.</v>

1890
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to like how much would I need</v>

1891
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.120
<v Speaker 4>my wind bonus or what if I lose this</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight or,</v>

1892
01:20:18.121 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 4>and you can't have any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be like truly free to</v>

1893
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:26.440
<v Speaker 4>perform and guys will spend years</v>
<v Speaker 4>trainings,</v>

1894
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 4>the physicality and the technical stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then not have a plan for that.</v>

1895
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.070
<v Speaker 4>When Cruz said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1896
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:33.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ring roster,</v>

1897
01:20:33.691 --> 01:20:37.260
<v Speaker 4>octagon shock or whatever is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russ is not real.</v>

1898
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:40.440
<v Speaker 4>I 100% believe that I hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>agree with them.</v>

1899
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.110
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think it's real,</v>

1900
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.780
<v Speaker 4>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not real to you.</v>

1901
01:20:45.781 --> 01:20:48.120
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the way it became not real to him is</v>

1902
01:20:48.121 --> 01:20:49.770
<v Speaker 4>he prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1903
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:52.050
<v Speaker 4>this is the second time I'm in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>

1904
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:54.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm more comfortable in it than I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>last time.</v>

1905
01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie and you are way more comfortable</v>

1906
01:20:57.570 --> 01:20:59.700
<v Speaker 4>than Brendan job who is more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 4>than me.</v>

1907
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:02.920
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's the environment and uh,</v>

1908
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 4>Bj Penn used to go and train for a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he'd have,</v>

1909
01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:06.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1910
01:21:06.421 --> 01:21:09.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rough and a fake ring announcer and an</v>

1911
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 4>audience and the walkout and he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>create all of that before he fought.</v>

1912
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 4>So that hue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff wasn't new because the first</v>

1913
01:21:17.641 --> 01:21:20.400
<v Speaker 4>fucking time you're standing in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and bruce buffer is doing that crazy</v>

1914
01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:23.280
<v Speaker 4>shit at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't prepared for that,</v>

1915
01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 4>all the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you either wake up or you somehow won,</v>

1916
01:21:27.001 --> 01:21:29.910
<v Speaker 4>but you really don't remember anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1917
01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:31.390
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you,</v>

1918
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 4>that can't be the first time that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at Bruce Babbitt,</v>

1919
01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 4>but it has to have been in your mind 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

1920
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:36.684
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1921
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.570
<v Speaker 4>this is where I belong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to be here.</v>

1922
01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:41.580
<v Speaker 4>I belong here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I earned my way here.</v>

1923
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bruce buffers introducing me because the</v>

1924
01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:45.450
<v Speaker 4>whole world's going to see how fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>good I am.</v>

1925
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 4>You can't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

1926
01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.660
<v Speaker 4>When you see the UFC does jogging over</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1927
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.550
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah you can't,</v>

1928
01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:56.430
<v Speaker 4>that can't be new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That has to have happened dozens or</v>

1929
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:57.900
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of times in your mind when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>go in there.</v>

1930
01:21:58.050 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting because a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

1931
01:21:59.431 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 4>their member mental preparation is just</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it and learning once you've done</v>

1932
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:07.350
<v Speaker 4>it instead of preparing for it and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you're actually doing it,</v>

1933
01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I've prepared for for sure.</v>

1934
01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even just all the way along,</v>

1935
01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:15.750
<v Speaker 4>like if there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all should learn stuff like that.</v>

1936
01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:19.080
<v Speaker 4>That's what I say all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'll like use an example of</v>

1937
01:22:19.081 --> 01:22:23.010
<v Speaker 4>something that I do or my friend does or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever and I don't mean to put it back</v>

1938
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 4>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying we should all try to do this.</v>

1939
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:28.120
<v Speaker 4>You look and you prepare for stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1940
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you go back and it's the work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the work that you did.</v>

1941
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not any,</v>

1942
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 4>you're just a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're a guy who worked like crazy,</v>

1943
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:37.650
<v Speaker 4>prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like crazy,</v>

1944
01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:41.490
<v Speaker 4>made notes of the things that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you can go back and look at your</v>

1945
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 4>journal or your notes and see everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done in the day or afternoon of</v>

1946
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 4>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff is fighting that all of your</v>

1947
01:22:48.811 --> 01:22:51.030
<v Speaker 4>work is fighting you all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to go in,</v>

1948
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:52.140
<v Speaker 4>go in there and have fun.</v>

1949
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:54.580
<v Speaker 4>The work's been done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the state you have to be in.</v>

1950
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 4>And the reason I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a stack of every breakdown I've</v>

1951
01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:58.710
<v Speaker 4>ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the work,</v>

1952
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 4>every note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like this high.</v>

1953
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 4>And I bring that with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I went to meet Dana and Craig,</v>

1954
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:07.630
<v Speaker 4>I had in my suitcase when I went down to</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet them and Vegas,</v>

1955
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:08.680
<v Speaker 4>cause I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1956
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:10.210
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to be here.</v>

1957
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:11.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked really hard on this stuff.</v>

1958
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to be talking to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1959
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.660
<v Speaker 4>This is where I'm supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I don't have that,</v>

1960
01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:17.560
<v Speaker 4>you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what,</v>

1961
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:18.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1962
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 4>what should I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I,</v>

1963
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:20.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be crushing.</v>

1964
01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to look at all the work that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you did and on that walk to the cage,</v>

1965
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.440
<v Speaker 4>I had terrible performances and I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>are two good ones.</v>

1966
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 4>And the best one was the last one cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understood what state you were</v>

1967
01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't be scared.</v>

1968
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't be angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't be out to get them.</v>

1969
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 4>You had to be fucking free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll love martial arts.</v>

1970
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 4>You love fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what you wanted to do.</v>

1971
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to be here.</v>

1972
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.860
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the state you have to be in</v>

1973
01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:49.390
<v Speaker 4>when you do a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you do a breakdown for conor</v>

1974
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 4>mcgregor and Hoffeld dos Anjos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you begin?</v>

1975
01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.010
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

1976
01:23:54.011 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 4>Do you watch footage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think about what you already</v>

1977
01:23:57.101 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 4>know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

1978
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:04.231
<v Speaker 4>how do you begin to break down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got to know what my point is.</v>

1979
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.160
<v Speaker 4>And the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1980
01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:11.390
<v Speaker 4>to influence the way people watch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting in a way that's positive and</v>

1981
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:16.360
<v Speaker 4>make them learn stuff and you'll hope it</v>
<v Speaker 4>influences other people who influence</v>

1982
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 4>stuff because you want people to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to inject these ideas into the</v>

1983
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:20.650
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1984
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.680
<v Speaker 4>So that has to be where you start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you start from that point,</v>

1985
01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:28.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not too I got to earn money or I</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to like get clicks and nothing.</v>

1986
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.960
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want people to see how fucking amazing</v>

1987
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you start from that point.</v>

1988
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:39.150
<v Speaker 4>That point could be months in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then there's things that you've been</v>

1989
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 4>watching and studying and looking at and</v>
<v Speaker 4>full immersion things like you know,</v>

1990
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.820
<v Speaker 4>this movement stuff that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about or,</v>

1991
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:49.800
<v Speaker 4>or comparisons that you make of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>people work against the cage and compare</v>

1992
01:24:49.801 --> 01:24:52.530
<v Speaker 4>it to another sport or all these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 4>are all floating around you.</v>

1993
01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully you've got 50 of them and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight comes up and you see,</v>

1994
01:24:57.011 --> 01:24:59.660
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's conor mcgregor and half fail dos</v>

1995
01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Anjos so that's got to start brewing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I asked Craig the accepted mine</v>

1996
01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:04.630
<v Speaker 4>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the next one is,</v>

1997
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.140
<v Speaker 4>is Jones and cormier.</v>

1998
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm on that already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on in that fight?</v>

1999
01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.380
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I look back at their other</v>

2000
01:25:11.381 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 4>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I look at at how they do what at,</v>

2001
01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:16.090
<v Speaker 4>what is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened,</v>

2002
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.520
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how's it going to happen?</v>

2003
01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:22.690
<v Speaker 4>And where's the fucking cool in it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that starts immediately and then you</v>

2004
01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:24.220
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have a couple of ideas,</v>

2005
01:25:24.221 --> 01:25:26.230
<v Speaker 4>you might have some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well you know range man.</v>

2006
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this four ranges kind of thing</v>

2007
01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:30.880
<v Speaker 4>I've been playing around with and I did</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in the,</v>

2008
01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:34.060
<v Speaker 4>Ronda won,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't release it as that w</v>

2009
01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 4>that version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was sure applies to Jon Jones.</v>

2010
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 4>So it'll start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll start thinking about it in terms of</v>

2011
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:43.660
<v Speaker 4>four different ranges and how he managed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the edit your versions.</v>

2012
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I send in multi.</v>

2013
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.910
<v Speaker 4>I sent in multiple versions for that one</v>
<v Speaker 4>only because they were like,</v>

2014
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:52.150
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know what I did or how I did</v>
<v Speaker 4>it or how I work with them or whatever.</v>

2015
01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:55.020
<v Speaker 4>Actually it's been super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I send it in,</v>

2016
01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:55.541
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2017
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:56.620
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And put it out.</v>

2018
01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.360
<v Speaker 4>But the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dana was like,</v>

2019
01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:00.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you give me like four minute version</v>

2020
01:26:00.291 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 4>and a five minute version of one minute?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to for him to wrap his head</v>

2021
01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the first one that I sent in was many</v>

2022
01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:11.300
<v Speaker 4>different ones and then since then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've been fucking super cool.</v>

2023
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 4>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2024
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 4>I think this guy's good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2025
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't go do that thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you hope.</v>

2026
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2027
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.910
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that one now you sent them multiple</v>

2028
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 4>and it was mostly just so they could get</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wrap their head around it.</v>

2029
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2030
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're working in a company,</v>

2031
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:29.390
<v Speaker 4>they got to figure out who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2032
01:26:29.391 --> 01:26:32.000
<v Speaker 4>he talks fast and it seems enthusiastic</v>
<v Speaker 4>as he smart,</v>

2033
01:26:32.001 --> 01:26:33.020
<v Speaker 4>as easy to work with.</v>

2034
01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 4>How does it take direction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2035
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to figure all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2036
01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.760
<v Speaker 4>But I think they figured out pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>

2037
01:26:37.761 --> 01:26:38.540
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2038
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.430
<v Speaker 4>he just likes doing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he does a good job.</v>

2039
01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 4>And so it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very committed to it.</v>

2040
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 4>If you were smart and you were running a</v>
<v Speaker 4>business and obviously the UFC is very</v>

2041
01:26:47.151 --> 01:26:48.740
<v Speaker 4>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at a garlic you with,</v>

2042
01:26:48.741 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just tell him to do it.</v>

2043
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to do it.</v>

2044
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.310
<v Speaker 4>He likes you to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2045
01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's been,</v>

2046
01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:55.850
<v Speaker 4>that's how it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're much direction.</v>

2047
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.421
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2048
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:57.540
<v Speaker 4>that's how it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2049
01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.540
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in that one,</v>

2050
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:01.610
<v Speaker 4>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll look at it and now I've got</v>

2051
01:27:01.611 --> 01:27:04.490
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fight is not for eight weeks,</v>

2052
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.610
<v Speaker 4>so I'll still do other breakdowns and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

2053
01:27:06.611 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 4>I work in the meantime I'd with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2054
01:27:08.271 --> 01:27:10.260
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a family,</v>

2055
01:27:10.261 --> 01:27:13.520
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do 40 hours a week of TV there and I</v>

2056
01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:15.740
<v Speaker 4>built these around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really do 40 hours,</v>

2057
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:18.680
<v Speaker 4>least of ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not have hours of TV,</v>

2058
01:27:18.681 --> 01:27:20.540
<v Speaker 4>but I'm in there five days a week.</v>

2059
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.810
<v Speaker 4>We're a 24 hour fight channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's six.</v>

2060
01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't want an American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2061
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 4>it's on like xbox and like all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>other things,</v>

2062
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.020
<v Speaker 4>those like Roku and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that kind of stuff.</v>

2063
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.870
<v Speaker 4>And then it's in the tristate area and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in Texas.</v>

2064
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 4>I could sit and it has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have national carriage,</v>

2065
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's got pockets of carriage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a no brainer.</v>

2066
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a channel that just had fights on all</v>

2067
01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 4>the time when people would just go like</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many times you've been flipping</v>

2068
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:48.150
<v Speaker 4>through the channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bored looking for something,</v>

2069
01:27:48.151 --> 01:27:50.690
<v Speaker 4>then you go to wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always go find some on the fight.</v>

2070
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:54.800
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in Canada the timing was pretty</v>

2072
01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:57.320
<v Speaker 4>good because George was a big star right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now in Ireland,</v>

2073
01:27:57.321 --> 01:27:59.210
<v Speaker 4>fighting is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2074
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:02.780
<v Speaker 4>and Canada was like that and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed us to kind of get entrenched in</v>

2075
01:28:02.781 --> 01:28:03.170
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2076
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:04.760
<v Speaker 4>But when all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day is fighting,</v>

2077
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:09.740
<v Speaker 4>literally it's like there are times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Robin and John and John Go and talk</v>

2078
01:28:09.741 --> 01:28:10.550
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2079
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:13.550
<v Speaker 4>this news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll do on a Monday we'll do five</v>

2080
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:15.110
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was an analysis show.</v>

2081
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 4>We'll do two or more chats of what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on in the news.</v>

2082
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll do five rounds today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a podcast version,</v>

2083
01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:25.160
<v Speaker 4>but it's for television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on Tuesday we'll do similar</v>

2084
01:28:25.161 --> 01:28:28.880
<v Speaker 4>stuff and then call two hours of all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>vintage pancreas.</v>

2085
01:28:28.881 --> 01:28:32.360
<v Speaker 4>And then the next day called two hours</v>
<v Speaker 4>of deep on a Japan,</v>

2086
01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.070
<v Speaker 4>so all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

2087
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:36.890
<v Speaker 4>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a fucking amazing thing,</v>

2088
01:28:36.891 --> 01:28:38.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because this is my life's work.</v>

2089
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:43.040
<v Speaker 4>It's my job and passion and obsession</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2090
01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:43.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2091
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.990
<v Speaker 4>I get to do it all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do that and I'm now making these</v>

2092
01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:50.300
<v Speaker 4>breakdowns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have to happen around that.</v>

2093
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.680
<v Speaker 4>But all day long you've got to be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something hits you or you pick up</v>

2094
01:28:54.681 --> 01:28:57.470
<v Speaker 4>on something or there's a sea change or</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some kind of little movement</v>

2095
01:28:57.471 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 4>going on in something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2096
01:28:59.121 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 4>I got to break down in six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I can explore that for that.</v>

2097
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Then you get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2098
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 4>the conor won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2099
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:10.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm very interested in this guy and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at these guys,</v>

2100
01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman's work ethic that taught</v>

2101
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 4>me how to work really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2102
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of worked hard,</v>

2103
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:16.770
<v Speaker 4>but you look at this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2104
01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 4>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how it's winners work.</v>

2105
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.060
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2106
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:21.630
<v Speaker 4>Mcgregor's growth mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2107
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:23.160
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how I'm going to get better and</v>

2108
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 4>better and better and he's innovating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to innovate.</v>

2109
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 4>If I innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want other people to spread the</v>

2110
01:29:29.851 --> 01:29:32.340
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want people to rip my stuff off cause</v>

2111
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:37.341
<v Speaker 4>then they'll rip off what I did a year</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago and then a year from now I'll do new</v>

2112
01:29:37.561 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2113
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Like you want it all to influence how</v>
<v Speaker 4>people see fighting because I think</v>

2114
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:43.920
<v Speaker 4>fighting is the coolest thing and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they see it through my eyes,</v>

2115
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:45.710
<v Speaker 4>they'll think that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2116
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 4>But you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2117
01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 4>So you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you caught,</v>

2118
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 4>you learn about innovating from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look at what Ron does going through</v>

2119
01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:54.480
<v Speaker 4>and you learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do people deal with that?</v>

2120
01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:56.360
<v Speaker 4>How would I deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then just get,</v>

2121
01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm super attached to all of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people in these things and these</v>

2122
01:30:00.181 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 4>experiences and I kind of get to live</v>
<v Speaker 4>them out and learn from them.</v>

2123
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:07.370
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at conor and Hoffeld no</v>

2124
01:30:07.371 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 4>song Jules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>

2125
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:14.160
<v Speaker 4>How do you think that is going down you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously a bunch of different</v>

2126
01:30:14.161 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 4>ways they can interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once the cage door shuts and the fight</v>

2127
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:19.320
<v Speaker 4>begins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

2128
01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:20.160
<v Speaker 4>how do you perceive it?</v>

2129
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:24.930
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go through fighting gets more and more</v>

2130
01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:28.080
<v Speaker 4>and more complicated and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through these periods where it gets</v>

2131
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really simple and then it gets more and</v>

2132
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 4>more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's kind of the process of my</v>

2133
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:34.770
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And right now I'm looking at it kind of</v>

2134
01:30:34.771 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 4>simply.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously connor wants to get,</v>

2135
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 4>connor has the left hand that knocks</v>
<v Speaker 4>people out.</v>

2136
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:44.580
<v Speaker 4>So almost everything he kind of built</v>
<v Speaker 4>was to put himself in a situation is to</v>

2137
01:30:44.581 --> 01:30:46.530
<v Speaker 4>hit guys with his left hand and knock</v>
<v Speaker 4>them unconscious.</v>

2138
01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:49.170
<v Speaker 4>So that's our job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to knock you unconscious with</v>

2139
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:51.240
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are some of the problems that</v>

2140
01:30:51.241 --> 01:30:52.790
<v Speaker 4>could prevent that from happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2141
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.440
<v Speaker 4>you can get ahold of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can push me up against the cage,</v>

2142
01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 4>you can do all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what are the ways that I could</v>

2143
01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 4>increase the likelihood of doing that?</v>

2144
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can fuck with you.</v>

2145
01:31:01.770 --> 01:31:04.440
<v Speaker 4>That seems to help works for everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's good at it.</v>

2146
01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:07.470
<v Speaker 4>But ultimately if dos Anjos puts him on</v>
<v Speaker 4>his back,</v>

2147
01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:10.380
<v Speaker 4>he's in real fucking trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in real fucking trouble.</v>

2148
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not kind of a pretty good</v>

2149
01:31:13.861 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not kind of this a vicious</v>

2150
01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.730
<v Speaker 4>violent guy who will happily stay on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your guard till caves your face and</v>

2151
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.190
<v Speaker 4>until you overreact and then he'll start</v>
<v Speaker 4>passing.</v>

2152
01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:25.980
<v Speaker 4>Then he'll start abusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in trouble.</v>

2153
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:29.130
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time we can't look at it</v>

2154
01:31:29.131 --> 01:31:31.290
<v Speaker 4>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I must stay off the ground at all costs</v>

2155
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.840
<v Speaker 4>because that infringes on connors being</v>
<v Speaker 4>connor.</v>

2156
01:31:34.230 --> 01:31:36.600
<v Speaker 4>So he has to play the game of Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thompson played.</v>

2157
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.540
<v Speaker 4>That has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the game most of these guys are</v>

2158
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 4>looking to try to do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thing about dos Anjos though,</v>

2159
01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:45.930
<v Speaker 4>he's very fast and he's very good at</v>
<v Speaker 4>closing the distance.</v>

2160
01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:47.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really shocked and the Pettis</v>

2161
01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:51.930
<v Speaker 4>fight how quickly he pulled the trigger</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how he leaves no space.</v>

2162
01:31:52.170 --> 01:31:56.340
<v Speaker 4>He leaves no space for you to analyze</v>
<v Speaker 4>his movement and prepare to counter.</v>

2163
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:59.230
<v Speaker 4>He's on you before you could get that</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing right.</v>

2164
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 4>The pedes one is definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was one of the ways I was going to</v>

2165
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 4>break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you're looking at it,</v>

2166
01:32:04.901 --> 01:32:08.920
<v Speaker 4>there starts to be multiple different</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways because no thing is one thing is 50</v>

2167
01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them was dos Anjos might be</v>

2168
01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:16.801
<v Speaker 4>looking at this as this is similar to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pettis fight and so what?</v>

2169
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.530
<v Speaker 4>What would you do different if you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>connor,</v>

2170
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:21.640
<v Speaker 4>if your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your job was to beat this guy,</v>

2171
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:27.360
<v Speaker 4>pedis didn't move laterally very much</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's also really good at the</v>

2172
01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:29.680
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him and Duke and lots of people I've</v>

2173
01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 4>been working on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you back up delivering with power</v>

2174
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 4>right back up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it has to do with the stomp of</v>

2175
01:32:35.231 --> 01:32:36.310
<v Speaker 4>the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

2176
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they were working on that.</v>

2177
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 4>This guy is a pressure fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As he moves forward,</v>

2178
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:41.914
<v Speaker 4>we're going to rip them.</v>

2179
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 4>We're going to hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to drop him.</v>

2180
01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.890
<v Speaker 4>We're going to discourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just never,</v>

2181
01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.940
<v Speaker 4>never got it off somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now my orbital bone is broken.</v>

2182
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:53.950
<v Speaker 4>My idea of lulling you in and hurting</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bad isn't working dog.</v>

2183
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:56.920
<v Speaker 4>The the adjustment is we got to start</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving laterally.</v>

2184
01:32:57.170 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 4>He never really orbital in the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>round.</v>

2185
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 4>First Punch that hard left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:02.943
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2187
01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Now the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then we're looking at it where connor</v>

2188
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 4>and his people and they're taking a</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive approach to it.</v>

2189
01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:11.380
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can we exploit?</v>

2190
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:15.430
<v Speaker 4>One thing does hang us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does all really the only thing that he,</v>

2191
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 4>if you're looking at it and going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2192
01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 4>what one thing jumps out as less than</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect for this killer champion and</v>

2193
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:23.590
<v Speaker 4>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really telegraphs his punches.</v>

2194
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:26.020
<v Speaker 4>He telegraphs them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see it,</v>

2195
01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>

2196
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:30.040
<v Speaker 4>and when I break things down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll watch fights in slow motion</v>

2197
01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:34.000
<v Speaker 4>sometimes dozens of times and now our</v>
<v Speaker 4>agile all I see,</v>

2198
01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.960
<v Speaker 3>did you see the video that somebody put</v>
<v Speaker 3>together?</v>

2199
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like an animated Gif file of a Aldo</v>
<v Speaker 3>chasing after connor connor landing the</v>

2200
01:33:42.171 --> 01:33:45.500
<v Speaker 3>left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the same exact movement by dos</v>

2201
01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Anjos chasing after pedis but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or chasing after Donald Rather.</v>

2202
01:33:49.221 --> 01:33:54.221
<v Speaker 3>But Donald Donald doesn't land the punch</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you see very similar movement.</v>

2203
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:55.630
<v Speaker 3>He sees.</v>

2204
01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what he says he sees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when I look at him,</v>

2205
01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:00.880
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does and I,</v>

2206
01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:05.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually hate to criticize it anyway.</v>

2207
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel comfortable with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel qualified to criticize.</v>

2208
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:10.840
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just a personal thing.</v>

2209
01:34:10.841 --> 01:34:12.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't think other people shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2210
01:34:12.701 --> 01:34:17.701
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at 90 to 90 to 99th</v>
<v Speaker 4>percentile fighters and I'm some guy who</v>

2211
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:23.340
<v Speaker 4>won a couple of fights and was terrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fights and,</v>

2212
01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2213
01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.113
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2214
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel qualified to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to always criticized because I don't</v>

2215
01:34:30.461 --> 01:34:30.950
<v Speaker 4>know how to,</v>

2216
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the way I look at fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what I try to look at fights is I</v>

2218
01:34:36.111 --> 01:34:38.480
<v Speaker 3>look at him like we're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics.</v>

2219
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an equation going on and one,</v>

2220
01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:46.820
<v Speaker 3>there's values and there's numbers in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one side and his values and numbers</v>

2221
01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:49.040
<v Speaker 3>and the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's fascinating to me about this</v>

2222
01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:53.000
<v Speaker 3>fight is there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's equations where you have to</v>

2223
01:34:53.001 --> 01:34:55.580
<v Speaker 3>factor in many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to factor in power,</v>

2224
01:34:55.581 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you have to factor in technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to factor in the ability to</v>

2225
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:03.761
<v Speaker 3>execute and you also have to factor in</v>
<v Speaker 3>persona and personality and just</v>

2226
01:35:04.521 --> 01:35:06.740
<v Speaker 3>charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the things that conor</v>

2227
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 3>brings to the table that's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to monetize or not monetize.</v>

2228
01:35:11.631 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to quantify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to measure how much he fucked</v>

2229
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:16.250
<v Speaker 3>with all those head.</v>

2230
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although just chased after him and get</v>

2231
01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 3>lit up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2232
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it that caused,</v>

2233
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 3>that was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

2234
01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.480
<v Speaker 3>there's many possible factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all these movements in interactions</v>

2235
01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:32.090
<v Speaker 3>that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can almost look at them like</v>

2236
01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:35.960
<v Speaker 3>a mathematical exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain guys like Ed Short,</v>

2237
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 3>fuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herman,</v>

2238
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 3>great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough guy,</v>

2239
01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 3>very good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2240
01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.100
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to confuse him with</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy Thompson.</v>

2241
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to like his footwork,</v>

2242
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 3>footwork and his movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at those two guys,</v>

2243
01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 3>mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked at them as an equation.</v>

2244
01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this side is very lopsided in its</v>

2245
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:53.600
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2246
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 3>like if you have $100 in one hand and</v>
<v Speaker 3>$10 in the other hand,</v>

2247
01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.290
<v Speaker 3>the hundred dollars is worth more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>$10.</v>

2248
01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.460
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2249
01:36:01.461 --> 01:36:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2250
01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2251
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2252
01:36:03.851 --> 01:36:06.800
<v Speaker 4>and all of that prefacing it was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2253
01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:12.100
<v Speaker 4>to say that now that I've watched</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the eye that I'm thinking it's</v>

2254
01:36:12.101 --> 01:36:14.770
<v Speaker 4>connors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watching him and his Iwatch and</v>

2255
01:36:14.771 --> 01:36:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Connor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see a Deus Angeles as being taken to</v>

2256
01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:23.320
<v Speaker 4>the best level of what you can take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys who still are kind of sturdy.</v>

2257
01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.220
<v Speaker 4>There's still got that old version of</v>
<v Speaker 4>strength,</v>

2258
01:36:27.221 --> 01:36:29.780
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not sort of free and flowing just,</v>

2259
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:33.790
<v Speaker 4>and you see his telegraphing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean he can't fuck you up.</v>

2260
01:36:33.791 --> 01:36:37.960
<v Speaker 4>Like just cause I would see that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean you can do anything about it or</v>

2261
01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:39.640
<v Speaker 4>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if he ends up on the ground,</v>

2262
01:36:39.641 --> 01:36:42.340
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's fucking telegraphing now?</v>

2263
01:36:42.341 --> 01:36:43.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of that may matter.</v>

2264
01:36:43.871 --> 01:36:47.980
<v Speaker 4>But that is what I definitely see now</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when I'm picturing what is connor</v>

2265
01:36:47.981 --> 01:36:48.820
<v Speaker 4>seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see,</v>

2266
01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:51.280
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move back,</v>

2267
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:52.300
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

2268
01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a much more sort of lady bird and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's built around an old sturdy style of</v>

2269
01:36:59.051 --> 01:37:04.051
<v Speaker 4>building a fighter and condit and oh and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcgregor and all these guys believe</v>

2270
01:37:04.601 --> 01:37:07.300
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that is not only mobility</v>

2271
01:37:07.301 --> 01:37:10.150
<v Speaker 4>where we move our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how we move through space.</v>

2272
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conduct comes on weird angles and</v>

2273
01:37:12.011 --> 01:37:15.490
<v Speaker 4>different things and that's gotta be</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's seeing.</v>

2274
01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Whether that matters or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2275
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:19.910
<v Speaker 4>it's suddenly doesn't matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he puts you on a backend,</v>

2276
01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:20.763
<v Speaker 4>caves are facing,</v>

2277
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:25.120
<v Speaker 3>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got some very good movement himself</v>

2278
01:37:25.121 --> 01:37:28.210
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dosantos may telegraph things a little</v>

2279
01:37:28.211 --> 01:37:30.790
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's because he puts so much power</v>

2280
01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.510
<v Speaker 3>into his shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's shocking about him though is his</v>

2281
01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:37.630
<v Speaker 3>ability to close the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very fast and he's not,</v>

2282
01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that have</v>

2283
01:37:38.621 --> 01:37:39.770
<v Speaker 3>disagreed with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with con.</v>

2284
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:43.870
<v Speaker 3>What Connor said is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a slower like stuck in the mud</v>

2285
01:37:43.871 --> 01:37:44.910
<v Speaker 3>version of Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2286
01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.210
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that at all.</v>

2287
01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I see a fucking savage.</v>

2288
01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a fucking savage.</v>

2289
01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I watched it,</v>

2290
01:37:50.571 --> 01:37:54.050
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're looking for what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could think you could exploit.</v>

2291
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2292
01:37:55.651 --> 01:37:56.520
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I can,</v>

2293
01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 4>I think I can see the things coming now</v>
<v Speaker 4>that may turn out to not be true,</v>

2294
01:38:00.301 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 4>and that's a bad time to figure that out</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet when you get ripped in the face.</v>

2295
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

2296
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:09.090
<v Speaker 4>it's also like the dude is just so</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressively violent.</v>

2297
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but whether it's mcgregor is not at the,</v>

2298
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:15.540
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or we haven't seen it at the Tom cruise</v>

2299
01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let's say that you and I have a</v>

2300
01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:19.980
<v Speaker 4>really great fighter and somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2301
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:23.010
<v Speaker 4>give you guys $1 million if you can have</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy beat dominick Cruz in five</v>

2302
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:24.570
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>

2303
01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:30.290
<v Speaker 4>If we start figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to teach him the same movement as</v>

2304
01:38:30.391 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most we can hope for is him</v>

2305
01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:36.530
<v Speaker 4>achieving dominick Cruz five years</v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier.</v>

2306
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the five years of learning it,</v>

2307
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:39.780
<v Speaker 4>dominant cruises improved for five</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2308
01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:41.970
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to figure out the answer to</v>

2309
01:38:41.971 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 4>make it not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the hard part.</v>

2310
01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:47.820
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what connor and his people I</v>

2311
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:52.821
<v Speaker 4>think believe is it will make it not</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what he wants it to be about.</v>

2312
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Well don't you think with a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominick Cruz,</v>

2313
01:38:55.051 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why dominic has</v>
<v Speaker 3>created that styles,</v>

2314
01:38:57.691 --> 01:39:00.450
<v Speaker 3>cause he's not capable of putting a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>way with one shot.</v>

2315
01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:04.920
<v Speaker 3>He's not that kind of conor mcgregor one</v>
<v Speaker 3>punch death touch kind of a guy.</v>

2316
01:39:04.921 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got to hit you with the volume</v>

2317
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:12.090
<v Speaker 3>and he's also very smart and very smart</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys don't want to get hit.</v>

2318
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 3>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They incorporate a lot of foot work and</v>

2319
01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 3>dominic's footwork is pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular.</v>

2320
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I watched him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were all just hanging around</v>

2321
01:39:20.101 --> 01:39:23.570
<v Speaker 3>backstage one day and he and Brian Stann</v>
<v Speaker 3>in DC,</v>

2322
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 3>we're talking just joking around and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>DC said,</v>

2323
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 3>show me some of that footwork Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or show me,</v>

2324
01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:31.260
<v Speaker 3>show me some of that footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2325
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominic and he steps in with this</v>

2326
01:39:33.661 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 3>shuffle and then sidestep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2327
01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see him just playing</v>

2328
01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:40.440
<v Speaker 3>around when someone's standing in front</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>

2329
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:43.200
<v Speaker 3>like a Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan was just standing there for him and</v>

2330
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:45.930
<v Speaker 3>he'd just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she don't like the way he's moving,</v>

2331
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:49.620
<v Speaker 3>calculate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure out like what you</v>

2332
01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:52.350
<v Speaker 3>think he's coming this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's going that way and then he's</v>

2333
01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:53.520
<v Speaker 3>coming this way again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2334
01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:56.060
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>

2335
01:39:56.220 --> 01:40:00.420
<v Speaker 3>Like improvised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these are like very specific,</v>

2336
01:40:00.421 --> 01:40:02.060
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2337
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:05.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of efficiency involved in</v>

2338
01:40:05.671 --> 01:40:06.960
<v Speaker 3>these movements are excellent</v>

2339
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.030
<v Speaker 4>to wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2340
01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.810
<v Speaker 4>and it's that same thing we were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2341
01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.020
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do submissions from guard</v>

2342
01:40:14.021 --> 01:40:16.180
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all my training partners are not</v>

2343
01:40:16.181 --> 01:40:18.910
<v Speaker 4>dealing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guys quietly just build in the shit</v>

2344
01:40:18.911 --> 01:40:20.980
<v Speaker 4>out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominick's been too in that for 10</v>

2345
01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:22.680
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've tried to figure that out now,</v>

2346
01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.860
<v Speaker 4>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years.</v>

2347
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:24.641
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what I want.</v>

2348
01:40:24.641 --> 01:40:27.580
<v Speaker 4>He did it in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all saw him do it and they still</v>

2349
01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:29.680
<v Speaker 4>let him do it and they didn't try to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2350
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:32.020
<v Speaker 4>He did it right out in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's nose.</v>

2351
01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.730
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to figure out when you watched</v>
<v Speaker 3>him do it.</v>

2352
01:40:34.731 --> 01:40:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Even while he was doing it with Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2353
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Calculus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2354
01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:40.160
<v Speaker 3>there's so many movements that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's capable of doing.</v>

2355
01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:45.161
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different combinations</v>
<v Speaker 3>of steps and exchanges and you think</v>

2356
01:40:45.651 --> 01:40:49.400
<v Speaker 3>he's stepping this way and he switched</v>
<v Speaker 3>stances and he goes off to the left and</v>

2357
01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:50.720
<v Speaker 3>he knows you're going to step in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2358
01:40:50.721 --> 01:40:52.550
<v Speaker 3>is this a movement trill?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2359
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.730
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to catch up to that.</v>

2360
01:40:57.731 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 3>He's been building that for 10 years in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of everybody and everybody sat</v>

2361
01:41:01.631 --> 01:41:03.340
<v Speaker 3>around going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's just dominic.</v>

2362
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's different.</v>

2363
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.420
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominic would tell you he's not</v>

2364
01:41:07.421 --> 01:41:08.530
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would say,</v>

2365
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 3>if you did this for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do it too.</v>

2366
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:13.360
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder why he gets plantar fasciitis.</v>

2367
01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2368
01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just incredible.</v>

2369
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his solution for having,</v>

2370
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:21.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says he has bitch hands,</v>

2371
01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.880
<v Speaker 3>he jokes around about it cause he has</v>
<v Speaker 3>small hands and he's broken them several</v>

2372
01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2373
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:27.220
<v Speaker 3>he put away Mitchell rocky in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>

2374
01:41:27.221 --> 01:41:28.900
<v Speaker 3>but it's very rare that he puts guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

2375
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.210
<v Speaker 3>He just doesn't have the physical frame</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

2376
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.390
<v Speaker 3>But because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's developed all this incredible</v>

2377
01:41:34.391 --> 01:41:36.010
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things I always tell</v>

2378
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:39.340
<v Speaker 3>people when you learn Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't learn Jujitsu from a gorilla</v>

2379
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:41.980
<v Speaker 3>learning from an Eddie Bravo or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2380
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 3>a small guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2381
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:48.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small physical like a guy was not</v>

2382
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 3>imposing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys are the ones you really want</v>

2383
01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:55.330
<v Speaker 3>to learn technique from them because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a develop that technique.</v>

2384
01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 3>It has to be laser sharp because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have the ability to gorilla out of</v>

2385
01:41:58.781 --> 01:42:00.010
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you,</v>

2386
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.230
<v Speaker 3>when you learn Jujitsu from really big</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2387
01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.570
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rare that they're technical.</v>

2388
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 3>It's really rare because they can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it work.</v>

2389
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 3>You want to bear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoshida,</v>

2391
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:12.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want a little tiny guy that has just</v>

2392
01:42:12.671 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 3>laser sharp technique and Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a heuler gracie.</v>

2393
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small person who's just got fucking</v>

2394
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 3>razors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>demendez brothers,</v>

2395
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:26.110
<v Speaker 3>perfect examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small guys with razor sharp technique.</v>

2396
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:28.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you watch them roll against even</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger guys,</v>

2397
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.320
<v Speaker 3>their technique is so fucking sharp they</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get through.</v>

2398
01:42:32.321 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you find a big guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got gorilla Jujitsu and he fights a</v>

2399
01:42:36.731 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 3>bigger gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets fucked up.</v>

2400
01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:43.860
<v Speaker 3>That's just what you said earlier when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hoist went into ufc one because they</v>

2401
01:42:44.051 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 3>knew it would be that much more amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the little dude did a sort of,</v>

2402
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 3>that's not really what happened though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard.</v>

2403
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard description of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2404
01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.710
<v Speaker 3>What really happened was they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>control Hickson.</v>

2405
01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Hickson was the master of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew who was the king,</v>

2406
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.130
<v Speaker 3>but you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if Hicks and one,</v>

2407
01:43:03.131 --> 01:43:05.620
<v Speaker 3>he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want $10 million and now I'm going to</v>

2408
01:43:05.621 --> 01:43:07.790
<v Speaker 3>go surf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was just doing them to fucking</v>

2409
01:43:07.810 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean hixon truly marches to the beat</v>

2410
01:43:11.831 --> 01:43:16.831
<v Speaker 3>of his own drum and no one could control</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and so his brother was not really</v>

2411
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:18.700
<v Speaker 3>interested in putting Hixon in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

2412
01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:23.730
<v Speaker 3>The idea was put hoi sin if voice lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you go into negotiations with</v>

2413
01:43:24.191 --> 01:43:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Hickson and you get hixon because Hixon</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to fuck everybody up.</v>

2414
01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.350
<v Speaker 3>It would have changed everything though</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

2415
01:43:30.351 --> 01:43:33.040
<v Speaker 3>it would have been different the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it would have been different.</v>

2416
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Like if you ever looked at some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal beat downs,</v>

2417
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 3>the Gracie in action beat downs at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hixson did.</v>

2418
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:41.950
<v Speaker 3>He's so God damn strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not just unbelievably technical</v>

2419
01:43:41.951 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 3>with his Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also really physically,</v>

2420
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:49.120
<v Speaker 3>really physically strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the audience,</v>

2421
01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them maybe wouldn't have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

2422
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu's amazing data gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

2423
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:56.840
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And hoists being there.</v>

2424
01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.120
<v Speaker 4>It was hoist fighting tonight too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2425
01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:01.750
<v Speaker 4>I know it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're sitting here,</v>

2426
01:44:01.770 --> 01:44:05.480
<v Speaker 4>hoist is going to fight and like three</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours is fifth in his fifties isn't at</v>

2427
01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:06.330
<v Speaker 4>least 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2428
01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>I think the 10 or 10 and him are both</v>
<v Speaker 4>50.</v>

2429
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let them choose up.</v>

2430
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:12.620
<v Speaker 4>Let them juice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're probably Gunna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can get around their fat,</v>

2432
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:19.400
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the 50.</v>

2433
01:44:19.401 --> 01:44:24.401
<v Speaker 4>Think about being 50 and I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still have this little tiny hint in</v>

2434
01:44:25.221 --> 01:44:27.680
<v Speaker 4>the back of my mind somewhere that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could fight one more time.</v>

2435
01:44:27.681 --> 01:44:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just hidden back there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were just talking about your head.</v>

2436
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:32.350
<v Speaker 4>I know that your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your is not so hot.</v>

2437
01:44:32.370 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2438
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a weird sort of perspective on</v>

2439
01:44:39.111 --> 01:44:39.760
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2440
01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one that's why I think we have to</v>

2441
01:44:42.471 --> 01:44:46.640
<v Speaker 4>celebrate these fights way more because</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys are getting hurt and they,</v>

2442
01:44:46.641 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it for their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or adventure or their reasons,</v>

2443
01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:51.650
<v Speaker 4>but they're still getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2444
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:55.550
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in Belize and with my wife and it</v>

2445
01:44:55.551 --> 01:44:57.110
<v Speaker 4>was beautiful actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful.</v>

2446
01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.830
<v Speaker 4>And you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a huge percentage of men over 40</v>

2447
01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:05.831
<v Speaker 4>that are blind and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're blind because they have their</v>

2448
01:45:05.901 --> 01:45:07.970
<v Speaker 4>big at one of their biggest crops is</v>
<v Speaker 4>cashews.</v>

2449
01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 4>And something about the process of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cashew farming makes you go blind in</v>

2450
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:14.600
<v Speaker 4>five years or 10 or 20 at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2451
01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 4>Certain certain people who work in</v>
<v Speaker 4>cashew farming,</v>

2452
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.480
<v Speaker 4>it's known that you will go blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2453
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you're 20,</v>

2454
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:24.980
<v Speaker 4>cashews are not worth going over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2455
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:29.360
<v Speaker 4>And so when you were 20 and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a cashew farmer,</v>

2456
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it with the knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be blind one day you</v>

2457
01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:33.650
<v Speaker 4>full knowledge.</v>

2458
01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Cause you've known your grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you knew what a uncle there's was just a</v>

2459
01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:40.910
<v Speaker 4>certain percentage of people and they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because at the end they will provide</v>

2460
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:42.650
<v Speaker 4>for their family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good career.</v>

2461
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:45.320
<v Speaker 4>You will uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of your kids.</v>

2462
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:48.950
<v Speaker 4>And they do it knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people go and they work in mines.</v>

2463
01:45:48.951 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 4>People do all kinds of things that harm</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

2464
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:53.390
<v Speaker 4>But you need to know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

2465
01:45:53.391 --> 01:45:57.590
<v Speaker 4>You need to be fully informed and make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>solid decision that this is what you</v>

2466
01:45:57.591 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 4>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of 17 year olds who go in and</v>

2467
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 4>start boxing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have all that information.</v>

2468
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:05.630
<v Speaker 4>No they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have it and you're like,</v>

2469
01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:07.550
<v Speaker 4>this is my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all I want to do,</v>

2470
01:46:07.670 --> 01:46:10.400
<v Speaker 4>this is what I want to do with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was put on earth to fight.</v>

2471
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 4>I know there'll be repercussions for</v>
<v Speaker 4>this in my future.</v>

2472
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.780
<v Speaker 4>And I'm choosing to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go do it man.</v>

2473
01:46:14.781 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 4>It's a free society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can eat as much sugar as you want</v>

2474
01:46:17.601 --> 01:46:19.580
<v Speaker 4>and that'll kill Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you can do it,</v>

2475
01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>but you want people to know the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

2476
01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:25.130
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea about cashew farm and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you find anything on that Jamie?</v>

2477
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Please don't tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a myth.</v>

2478
01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.950
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see anything about blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's like blood cashews are</v>

2479
01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:35.200
<v Speaker 4>coming up and there's the way that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>farm them and get good them do shelled</v>

2480
01:46:35.201 --> 01:46:38.420
<v Speaker 4>is pretty bad and it causes people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense pain cause there's some sort of</v>

2481
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.920
<v Speaker 4>a liquid that comes out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We pulled a show,</v>

2482
01:46:40.921 --> 01:46:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a chemical that's used and I don't</v>

2483
01:46:43.221 --> 01:46:44.880
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what cashew shell.</v>

2484
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:49.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was something that was mentioned</v>

2485
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.020
<v Speaker 4>more than a couple of times in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in um,</v>

2486
01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.173
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2487
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How weird.</v>

2488
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that chemical could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to pain,</v>

2489
01:46:57.391 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 4>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe one of the effects.</v>

2490
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:01.980
<v Speaker 4>But that was the story that I was told</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than a few times.</v>

2491
01:47:02.410 --> 01:47:04.680
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>down there about that don't even look</v>

2492
01:47:04.681 --> 01:47:08.380
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like like Avatar plant.</v>

2493
01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.600
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2494
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't look real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like some sort of a weird,</v>

2495
01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:14.670
<v Speaker 4>crazy squash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you decide you're going to go</v>

2496
01:47:14.671 --> 01:47:18.240
<v Speaker 4>farm that stuff and you know what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome is and you do it anyways,</v>

2497
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:20.400
<v Speaker 4>that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you chose to do that for whatever your</v>

2498
01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:21.040
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

2499
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.840
<v Speaker 3>So you're not finding anything on</v>
<v Speaker 3>cashews causing blindness guys.</v>

2500
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give it a,</v>

2501
01:47:26.051 --> 01:47:28.480
<v Speaker 3>give it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.510
<v Speaker 3>It just makes me sad that these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously don't have a whole lot of</v>

2503
01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:33.520
<v Speaker 3>options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me not want to buy cashews,</v>

2504
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they don't have any money.</v>

2505
01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.460
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck do you do?</v>

2506
01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2507
01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting is,</v>

2508
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.220
<v Speaker 3>is also some people can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2509
01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Bas rutten who was here on Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously former UFC heavyweight</v>

2510
01:47:46.511 --> 01:47:48.340
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the greats,</v>

2511
01:47:48.341 --> 01:47:51.010
<v Speaker 3>one of the real pioneers of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharp as a tack.</v>

2512
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:53.080
<v Speaker 3>No problems mentally at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2513
01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:56.080
<v Speaker 3>boss was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was our 10 he's speaking a second</v>

2514
01:47:56.081 --> 01:47:56.960
<v Speaker 3>language by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he speaks Dutch.</v>

2516
01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:02.080
<v Speaker 3>So in English he smooth as silk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking fast,</v>

2517
01:48:02.081 --> 01:48:06.360
<v Speaker 3>he's got all these great stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His memory sharp as a razor is noah.</v>

2518
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:09.910
<v Speaker 3>No problems with him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course we all know guys that</v>

2519
01:48:09.911 --> 01:48:14.320
<v Speaker 3>are punchy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known a lot of guys from the time</v>

2520
01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:18.220
<v Speaker 3>when I was a teenager and now today I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't talk to them anymore because</v>

2521
01:48:18.221 --> 01:48:20.530
<v Speaker 3>they're fucked up guys from my old</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing gym,</v>

2522
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:22.290
<v Speaker 3>they're fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2523
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:23.710
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have real problems.</v>

2524
01:48:23.711 --> 01:48:25.330
<v Speaker 3>Like they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very compromised.</v>

2525
01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:28.030
<v Speaker 3>And I feel very fortunate that I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure,</v>

2526
01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:30.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely,</v>

2527
01:48:31.090 --> 01:48:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I definitely got hit a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sure there's something that</v>

2528
01:48:35.531 --> 01:48:39.040
<v Speaker 3>didn't go well up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably made me more impulsive,</v>

2529
01:48:39.250 --> 01:48:41.620
<v Speaker 3>more angry or more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2530
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>

2531
01:48:42.431 --> 01:48:46.150
<v Speaker 3>but overall I got out of it pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>unscathed.</v>

2532
01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:48.670
<v Speaker 3>But that's cause I stopped fighting when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 22.</v>

2533
01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I realized at that age I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

2534
01:48:51.941 --> 01:48:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm already getting headaches and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2535
01:48:54.370 --> 01:48:56.890
<v Speaker 3>there's no future in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then there was no money in it.</v>

2536
01:48:56.891 --> 01:49:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Back then there was no mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just kickboxing and I was like,</v>

2537
01:49:00.641 --> 01:49:01.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2538
01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:03.100
<v Speaker 3>this is not my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
01:49:03.101 --> 01:49:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I was way better at taekwondo then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't kickboxing.</v>

2540
01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.251
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2541
01:49:06.251 --> 01:49:10.780
<v Speaker 3>my kicks were my biggest attribute and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was learning how to box more and in that</v>

2542
01:49:10.781 --> 01:49:12.570
<v Speaker 3>learning I was getting the fuck beat out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of me.</v>

2543
01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.390
<v Speaker 4>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most abuse I took was boxing.</v>

2544
01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I love boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fun.</v>

2545
01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I took a lot of it.</v>

2546
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:22.050
<v Speaker 4>I remember I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a couple of concussions.</v>

2547
01:49:22.051 --> 01:49:25.890
<v Speaker 4>One for sure that I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like life was different the</v>

2548
01:49:25.891 --> 01:49:29.910
<v Speaker 4>moment after that concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way that I saw the world was</v>

2549
01:49:29.911 --> 01:49:32.700
<v Speaker 4>different after I took that one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just training.</v>

2550
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just,</v>

2551
01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my perspective,</v>

2552
01:49:35.881 --> 01:49:39.030
<v Speaker 4>my pr perception or something in like in</v>
<v Speaker 4>what way?</v>

2553
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.360
<v Speaker 4>I had a headache and I threw up that</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

2554
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:44.790
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in lethbridge and you know Jordan</v>

2555
01:49:44.791 --> 01:49:45.700
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2556
01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 4>his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee is a good friend and Lee and Jordan</v>

2557
01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:51.010
<v Speaker 4>were out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went to train and this guy Dan</v>

2558
01:49:51.011 --> 01:49:53.770
<v Speaker 4>torture chambers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a big powerful good one,</v>

2559
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:55.880
<v Speaker 4>80 fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2560
01:49:55.950 --> 01:49:56.830
<v Speaker 4>you were sparring with one.</v>

2561
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck I was</v>

2562
01:49:58.241 --> 01:49:59.950
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually danced at one 85.</v>

2563
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying this to hundreds to 10</v>

2564
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 4>and I thought we were just going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>light spar,</v>

2565
01:50:05.021 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I took a crazy straight,</v>

2566
01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

2567
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:14.320
<v Speaker 4>he was a south and I took a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight laughter or two from him.</v>

2568
01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:17.380
<v Speaker 4>And then immediately something was</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2569
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 4>And then I started slipping it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hitting him with my left hook and I was</v>

2570
01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:23.290
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's moments in fighting where you</v>

2571
01:50:23.291 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out you're just not,</v>

2572
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like Chris Weidman and you know,</v>

2573
01:50:27.311 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 4>that's just the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there's moments in a fight or</v>

2574
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:34.480
<v Speaker 4>inspiring where you're like very proud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when threatened with danger,</v>

2575
01:50:34.481 --> 01:50:36.940
<v Speaker 4>my answer was to fucking hit it back as</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard as I could.</v>

2576
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So got through the round or rounds and</v>

2577
01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:40.390
<v Speaker 4>then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a headache.</v>

2578
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:42.340
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went in,</v>

2579
01:50:42.341 --> 01:50:46.490
<v Speaker 4>I ring announced that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started throwing up in the back and I</v>

2580
01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:48.520
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my thought process was different.</v>

2581
01:50:48.521 --> 01:50:52.270
<v Speaker 4>I was single at the time and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>really cute girl was asking me to go</v>

2582
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:57.570
<v Speaker 4>hang out with her and I just couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>focus and I got better a month or two</v>

2583
01:50:57.731 --> 01:51:00.250
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like that day was different</v>

2584
01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>

2585
01:51:01.331 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like I saw things</v>

2586
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:06.670
<v Speaker 4>differently or thought differently or it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2587
01:51:06.671 --> 01:51:09.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very distinct moment.</v>

2588
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Like that time I almost didn't get off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the couch from the,</v>

2589
01:51:12.131 --> 01:51:14.650
<v Speaker 4>you know that that moment I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>different after it.</v>

2590
01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2591
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:17.860
<v Speaker 3>you didn't even get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2592
01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.660
<v Speaker 3>that was really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Bell rang,</v>

2593
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:23.570
<v Speaker 3>but you kept sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you series still mobile?</v>

2594
01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your legs were working.</v>

2595
01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

2596
01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after,</v>

2597
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.100
<v Speaker 4>after that sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the,</v>

2598
01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.720
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really train anymore and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gave me a ride back and the rest of</v>

2599
01:51:32.721 --> 01:51:33.950
<v Speaker 4>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the ringing outs,</v>

2600
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:37.250
<v Speaker 4>I think I was probably behaving very</v>
<v Speaker 4>strangely during it.</v>

2601
01:51:37.670 --> 01:51:41.600
<v Speaker 4>And I don't remember that day super well</v>
<v Speaker 4>other than telling that pretty girl that</v>

2602
01:51:41.601 --> 01:51:44.030
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't hang out with her because my</v>
<v Speaker 4>head hurt so much.</v>

2603
01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember the rest of the round though,</v>

2604
01:51:46.281 --> 01:51:49.940
<v Speaker 4>and I remember and I got a concussion in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first couple of shots of my first</v>

2605
01:51:49.941 --> 01:51:52.400
<v Speaker 4>fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I fought till about the middle of</v>

2606
01:51:52.401 --> 01:51:54.140
<v Speaker 4>the second round and I knew I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

2607
01:51:54.230 --> 01:51:59.180
<v Speaker 4>Like you just know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's cool in a weird way that you go</v>

2608
01:51:59.181 --> 01:52:02.600
<v Speaker 4>and keep fighting because now I</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it when I commentate or when</v>

2609
01:52:02.601 --> 01:52:04.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm analyzing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had that experience and that's why</v>

2610
01:52:04.971 --> 01:52:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I fought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was to have that understanding.</v>

2611
01:52:07.131 --> 01:52:11.660
<v Speaker 4>But I know what it is to fight with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>concussion or spar with a concussion and</v>

2612
01:52:11.661 --> 01:52:14.120
<v Speaker 4>you see that guys do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're hurting round one and they'll</v>

2613
01:52:14.121 --> 01:52:15.410
<v Speaker 4>fight all the way through sometimes when</v>

2614
01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>

2615
01:52:18.551 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 3>they're going to figure out in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future to mitigate some of the problems</v>

2616
01:52:22.211 --> 01:52:23.530
<v Speaker 3>of head impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2617
01:52:23.531 --> 01:52:27.370
<v Speaker 3>whether it's going to be something with</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cells or some sort of a new method</v>

2618
01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:32.371
<v Speaker 3>of rehabilitating and healing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so depressing to me to watch this</v>

2619
01:52:33.610 --> 01:52:38.610
<v Speaker 3>incredible problem solving at its</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest level event like mma or like</v>

2620
01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.730
<v Speaker 3>boxing or kickboxing or anything along</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>

2621
01:52:42.731 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 3>What Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but knowing that anytime like go con</v>

2622
01:52:46.371 --> 01:52:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Saki lands a head kick on somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy might not ever be the same</v>

2623
01:52:49.761 --> 01:52:52.790
<v Speaker 3>again and that is a big fucking factor</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

2624
01:52:52.791 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I really get upset when people downplay</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2625
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see someone get head</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicked and knocked dead,</v>

2626
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.110
<v Speaker 3>they might not ever be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a fact.</v>

2627
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:09.430
<v Speaker 3>I know guy back when I was a young kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>who got kicked in the head and the</v>

2628
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:12.470
<v Speaker 3>doctor told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to ever do combat</v>

2629
01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:15.110
<v Speaker 3>sports again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to ever do contact</v>

2630
01:53:15.111 --> 01:53:17.480
<v Speaker 3>sports again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you playing football.</v>

2631
01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't want you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like stop.</v>

2632
01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.160
<v Speaker 3>You have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

2633
01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:24.480
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got fucking killed and you survived.</v>

2634
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:27.470
<v Speaker 3>You got real lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see guys like that,</v>

2635
01:53:27.471 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 3>they get hit like that and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting five months later,</v>

2636
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 3>six months later and they not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell they're not the same.</v>

2637
01:53:33.771 --> 01:53:35.210
<v Speaker 3>They can't take a shot anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2638
01:53:35.610 --> 01:53:36.780
<v Speaker 4>it is spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2639
01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2640
01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.910
<v Speaker 4>cause there isn't really one now other</v>
<v Speaker 4>than the not,</v>

2641
01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:46.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't spar with big guys like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do it because it's fun and it's fun</v>

2642
01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:47.820
<v Speaker 4>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should never,</v>

2643
01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.480
<v Speaker 4>and most guys aren't doing that as are</v>
<v Speaker 4>many guys are not doing that as much.</v>

2644
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:53.070
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2645
01:53:53.071 --> 01:53:54.210
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

2646
01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:58.080
<v Speaker 4>when you get the chance to have people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who have trained their whole lives to</v>

2647
01:53:58.081 --> 01:54:01.800
<v Speaker 4>help us have an experiment in combat</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

2648
01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:05.040
<v Speaker 4>in front of all of us that has such a</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and wonderful thing in</v>

2649
01:54:05.041 --> 01:54:06.290
<v Speaker 4>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like peep,</v>

2650
01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.860
<v Speaker 4>we were fighting as a part of what we do</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting as a part of us getting here.</v>

2651
01:54:10.861 --> 01:54:14.820
<v Speaker 4>It may be a part of our future depending</v>
<v Speaker 4>on where we are and what's happening and</v>

2652
01:54:14.821 --> 01:54:16.920
<v Speaker 4>different aspects of a fighting is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of us.</v>

2653
01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:21.540
<v Speaker 4>And to see it done at that level and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of almost global experiment</v>

2654
01:54:21.541 --> 01:54:23.400
<v Speaker 4>kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful.</v>

2655
01:54:23.401 --> 01:54:26.550
<v Speaker 4>It's this wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly artistic thing.</v>

2656
01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:27.803
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

2657
01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:30.510
<v Speaker 4>it has the downside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's another reason.</v>

2658
01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.110
<v Speaker 4>It just sickens me when I see the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>people respond to a Rhonda or respond.</v>

2659
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Connor's gonna lose one day and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to respond to that guy,</v>

2660
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2661
01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks,</v>

2662
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:40.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost.</v>

2663
01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.840
<v Speaker 4>How are people responding to this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because these guys are just doing</v>

2664
01:54:42.841 --> 01:54:45.380
<v Speaker 4>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible things for the,</v>

2665
01:54:45.690 --> 01:54:48.060
<v Speaker 4>the furthering of what humanity is</v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of.</v>

2666
01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love to attack people when they</v>

2667
01:54:50.671 --> 01:54:52.320
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the way hendricks last,</v>

2668
01:54:52.321 --> 01:54:53.510
<v Speaker 4>I saw people attack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2669
01:54:53.511 --> 01:54:54.120
<v Speaker 4>in law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2670
01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.350
<v Speaker 4>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2671
01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:57.800
<v Speaker 4>I just fought a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2672
01:54:57.990 --> 01:55:01.140
<v Speaker 4>he fought like a real striking wizard</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he learned something.</v>

2673
01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:03.900
<v Speaker 4>People should have fucking me weighed</v>
<v Speaker 4>against Woodley,</v>

2674
01:55:04.650 --> 01:55:05.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking cheater.</v>

2675
01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:10.470
<v Speaker 4>He was probably on pdds before all this</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate and nonsense and just terrible,</v>

2676
01:55:10.471 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 4>terrible fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read about him online with God,</v>

2677
01:55:13.401 --> 01:55:14.760
<v Speaker 4>I'll ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll everyone deals with it.</v>

2678
01:55:14.761 --> 01:55:19.330
<v Speaker 4>I've actually taken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only time I ever take stabs and you</v>

2679
01:55:19.331 --> 01:55:20.420
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even talking about it,</v>

2680
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:23.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel great about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's when guys Ms. Wade and other</v>

2681
01:55:23.401 --> 01:55:24.900
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters are doing it.</v>

2682
01:55:24.901 --> 01:55:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Coaches do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just missing weight.</v>

2683
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:31.620
<v Speaker 4>There was always uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>penalties for it.</v>

2684
01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:34.230
<v Speaker 4>You're going to lose part of your purse</v>
<v Speaker 4>and public.</v>

2685
01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:36.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finger pointing has always been a part</v>

2686
01:55:36.931 --> 01:55:39.300
<v Speaker 4>of that penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every other guy on that card has made</v>

2687
01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:41.460
<v Speaker 4>weight then that's the worst part about</v>
<v Speaker 4>their job.</v>

2688
01:55:41.610 --> 01:55:45.360
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully guys are getting w I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are getting away from weight cutting</v>

2689
01:55:45.361 --> 01:55:49.530
<v Speaker 4>a little more as we're getting away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bodybuilder wrestler.</v>

2690
01:55:49.531 --> 01:55:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of that uh,</v>

2691
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:55.710
<v Speaker 4>prototype of fighter and that prototype</v>
<v Speaker 4>of fighter is going to be keep getting</v>

2692
01:55:55.711 --> 01:55:58.200
<v Speaker 4>beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that we have new answers to him.</v>

2693
01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And I think as that fight or changes</v>
<v Speaker 4>that weight cutting is a part of that</v>

2694
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.110
<v Speaker 4>prototype.</v>

2695
01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Well also you sada and the ivy band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue.</v>

2696
01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:10.190
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they started banning the Ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw people's body weights lowering</v>

2697
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:14.810
<v Speaker 3>because they realized they could make</v>
<v Speaker 3>that big crazy 25 pound cut in a couple</v>

2698
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:18.410
<v Speaker 3>of days and rehabilitate enough for</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehydrate enough rather to be able to</v>

2699
01:56:18.411 --> 01:56:20.630
<v Speaker 3>fight 24 hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't do it.</v>

2700
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:23.600
<v Speaker 3>You have to drop your body weight down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to</v>

2701
01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.380
<v Speaker 4>at Castro diuretics before you decided</v>
<v Speaker 4>to diuretics.</v>

2702
01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:32.740
<v Speaker 4>We all hear who apparently is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I talk about fighting all day on TV.</v>

2703
01:56:32.890 --> 01:56:36.790
<v Speaker 4>I can't address that because just</v>
<v Speaker 4>because some three coaches and two</v>

2704
01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:38.650
<v Speaker 4>fighters are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows that guy's doing it.</v>

2705
01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Never failed a test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2706
01:56:40.570 --> 01:56:43.660
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just you can't really talk about</v>

2707
01:56:43.661 --> 01:56:45.730
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can make observations around it,</v>

2708
01:56:46.330 --> 01:56:48.640
<v Speaker 4>but the truth is that in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2709
01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:52.510
<v Speaker 4>if you were fighting Josh Barnett in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

2710
01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.930
<v Speaker 4>like you don't know what somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be on,</v>

2711
01:56:55.931 --> 01:56:57.970
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what vandelay might be</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2712
01:56:57.971 --> 01:56:59.610
<v Speaker 4>You got to go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do.</v>

2713
01:56:59.611 --> 01:57:01.900
<v Speaker 4>You do what you thought you had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2714
01:57:01.901 --> 01:57:04.450
<v Speaker 4>if you were fighting in pride after a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few years,</v>

2715
01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.550
<v Speaker 4>first call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to make us to a doctor because</v>

2716
01:57:06.551 --> 01:57:10.510
<v Speaker 4>you may not want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may be harmful for your future in</v>

2717
01:57:10.511 --> 01:57:13.750
<v Speaker 4>some ways depending,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I dunno what I'm going to pride.</v>

2718
01:57:13.751 --> 01:57:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Look at the sky so they're all on</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2719
01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:17.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to fight.</v>

2720
01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:18.880
<v Speaker 4>I've got to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2721
01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you don't go ask the bodybuilder up at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gym.</v>

2722
01:57:21.131 --> 01:57:22.000
<v Speaker 4>He go ask a doctor.</v>

2723
01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting too because when you</v>

2724
01:57:23.441 --> 01:57:26.950
<v Speaker 3>watch guys that were competing in pride</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're looking amazing,</v>

2725
01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:30.430
<v Speaker 3>and then you see them when they got over</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the UFC and they weren't nearly as</v>

2726
01:57:30.431 --> 01:57:31.430
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to look.</v>

2727
01:57:31.450 --> 01:57:33.010
<v Speaker 3>You have to think one of two things</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

2728
01:57:33.011 --> 01:57:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Either they took so much punishment in</v>
<v Speaker 3>pride,</v>

2729
01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:38.320
<v Speaker 3>but they never really fully recovered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is absolutely possible.</v>

2730
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Or they were on some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2731
01:57:40.570 --> 01:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>And so both or both?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2732
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most likely.</v>

2733
01:57:43.631 --> 01:57:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2734
01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing people don't see,</v>

2735
01:57:46.901 --> 01:57:48.040
<v Speaker 4>somehow they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2736
01:57:48.041 --> 01:57:50.770
<v Speaker 4>that guy did steroids and now he's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That may be true,</v>

2737
01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:54.340
<v Speaker 4>but the natural reaction is this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether that's your hormones,</v>

2738
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.920
<v Speaker 4>your hormonal expression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing hand motions for people to</v>

2739
01:57:56.921 --> 01:57:57.690
<v Speaker 4>just listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2740
01:57:57.690 --> 01:57:59.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2741
01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2742
01:58:01.450 --> 01:58:02.141
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2743
01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:04.810
<v Speaker 4>your hormone levels will crash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they crash,</v>

2744
01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:06.340
<v Speaker 4>v like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2745
01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.000
<v Speaker 4>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our TV tour and Dad Bod Vitara is not</v>

2746
01:58:10.001 --> 01:58:10.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2747
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:14.230
<v Speaker 4>in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had to take trt because you had</v>

2748
01:58:14.231 --> 01:58:17.440
<v Speaker 4>no or very little testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now that you're off it,</v>

2749
01:58:17.530 --> 01:58:19.170
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be dad bod.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vito,</v>

2750
01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:23.440
<v Speaker 4>when I saw that and it was no one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was really happy for [inaudible] to</v>

2751
01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:25.910
<v Speaker 4>not look like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2752
01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:28.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the incredible Hawk and still win.</v>

2753
01:58:28.330 --> 01:58:30.400
<v Speaker 4>That said a lot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he fought Henderson,</v>

2754
01:58:30.401 --> 01:58:31.234
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2755
01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But who knows,</v>

2756
01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:33.860
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2757
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:36.630
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what kind of shenanigans are</v>

2758
01:58:36.631 --> 01:58:37.411
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2759
01:58:37.411 --> 01:58:38.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're fighting in</v>

2760
01:58:38.671 --> 01:58:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to say it,</v>

2761
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true.</v>

2762
01:58:43.050 --> 01:58:44.830
<v Speaker 3>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2763
01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the future holds as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as testing for performance enhancing</v>

2764
01:58:51.431 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've got to imagine that they're</v>

2765
01:58:53.741 --> 01:58:57.430
<v Speaker 3>closing in to the point where there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no wiggle room and these guys</v>

2766
01:58:57.431 --> 01:59:01.000
<v Speaker 3>getting popped but never got pop before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when glazing got popped and</v>

2767
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:01.811
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2768
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 3>who fucking saw that comment guy looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the incredible hulk.</v>

2769
01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So the biggest weight cutters in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history of the sport,</v>

2770
01:59:07.091 --> 01:59:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is the biggest 155 pound</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2771
01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Bigger than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he would weigh one 55 it make</v>

2772
01:59:15.291 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 3>weight shredded and then the next day</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

2773
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's 200 pounds.</v>

2774
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 3>He's so God damn big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so big.</v>

2775
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Just swirl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shredded,</v>

2776
01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 3>not an ounce of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gorilla strong and and freakish</v>

2777
01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:33.010
<v Speaker 3>endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He popped hot for EPO.</v>

2778
01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:34.810
<v Speaker 3>He pop top for something else.</v>

2779
01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>

2780
01:59:35.761 --> 01:59:37.460
<v Speaker 4>It might've been a diarrhetic too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then</v>

2781
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Ramiro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one.</v>

2782
01:59:39.081 --> 01:59:41.120
<v Speaker 3>You look at that guy and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well just fucking,</v>

2783
01:59:41.121 --> 01:59:42.170
<v Speaker 3>how's that even human?</v>

2784
01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I love the Usada Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he introduced the concept of the</v>

2785
01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:47.620
<v Speaker 4>smell test,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that is basically like,</v>

2786
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:50.230
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what that is.</v>

2787
01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Skis on top of the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2788
01:59:52.521 --> 01:59:53.870
<v Speaker 3>he's giving these guys</v>

2789
01:59:54.170 --> 01:59:54.830
<v Speaker 4>base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2790
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:56.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean either,</v>

2791
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:59.450
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody can do whatever,</v>

2792
01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.490
<v Speaker 4>which is probably going to be unsafe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of ways.</v>

2793
02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.800
<v Speaker 4>Yes or well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to kind of test,</v>

2794
02:00:03.801 --> 02:00:07.070
<v Speaker 4>but you guys work around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your work arounds will be an acceptable</v>

2795
02:00:07.071 --> 02:00:09.890
<v Speaker 4>amount of drug use that we're all going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say we're okay with them.</v>

2796
02:00:09.891 --> 02:00:10.590
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

2797
02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:12.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because the UFC didn't</v>

2798
02:00:12.241 --> 02:00:13.370
<v Speaker 3>have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2799
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:15.450
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all their own idea.</v>

2800
02:00:15.451 --> 02:00:18.330
<v Speaker 3>This is not instituted by the Nevada</v>
<v Speaker 3>state athletic commission.</v>

2801
02:00:18.331 --> 02:00:20.850
<v Speaker 3>This is entirely the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>

2802
02:00:20.851 --> 02:00:23.250
<v Speaker 3>His idea to bring into Wicki and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2803
02:00:23.490 --> 02:00:27.180
<v Speaker 3>let's fucking chase this down to the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the earth.</v>

2804
02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:29.610
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find exactly what the fuck these people</v>

2805
02:00:29.611 --> 02:00:32.760
<v Speaker 3>are doing and let's clean up the sport</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're seeing much more realistic</v>

2806
02:00:32.761 --> 02:00:36.600
<v Speaker 3>body's much more realistic performances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing guys like Eric Silva like</v>

2807
02:00:36.601 --> 02:00:39.750
<v Speaker 3>change radically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looked like he used to look like,</v>

2808
02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>

2809
02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:42.340
<v Speaker 3>yoked up Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2810
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:44.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he became like,</v>

2811
02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:45.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an athlete.</v>

2812
02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.140
<v Speaker 3>You had a fucking regular athletes.</v>

2813
02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in saskatoon when he fought and</v>

2814
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.880
<v Speaker 4>when he went out to do the open workout</v>
<v Speaker 4>where like,</v>

2815
02:00:51.170 --> 02:00:53.550
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy looks totally different.</v>

2816
02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2817
02:00:54.991 --> 02:00:59.991
<v Speaker 4>it's funny being a fan or a fanatic fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2818
02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.940
<v Speaker 4>people always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of that negativity we were</v>

2819
02:01:02.941 --> 02:01:05.490
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People always want to take us a jab at</v>

2820
02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:10.140
<v Speaker 4>the UFC or Dana or whenever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever wants to point out the good</v>

2821
02:01:10.141 --> 02:01:12.000
<v Speaker 4>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the really positive moves that they</v>

2822
02:01:12.001 --> 02:01:13.080
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of those,</v>

2823
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.940
<v Speaker 4>it's a big one that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2824
02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:16.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2825
02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:22.080
<v Speaker 4>you can't half asset because if you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>facet and leave it to the end.</v>

2826
02:01:22.210 --> 02:01:24.720
<v Speaker 4>Nick Dana used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not our job.</v>

2827
02:01:24.721 --> 02:01:27.750
<v Speaker 4>It's the commission's job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason they instituted this is like</v>

2828
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:29.460
<v Speaker 4>they're just not doing a good enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>

2829
02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:30.623
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2830
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:33.510
<v Speaker 3>it's doing is inexpensive and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do it.</v>

2831
02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:36.510
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of blood tests the Usada guys</v>

2832
02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:41.330
<v Speaker 3>are doing is so much more comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was also why it was so maddening</v>

2833
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:43.700
<v Speaker 3>when Nick Diaz got in trouble because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick Diaz,</v>

2834
02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:46.890
<v Speaker 3>and this is also to Novitsky his credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Novitsky was one of the ones that say,</v>

2835
02:01:46.891 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This suspension is bullshit.</v>

2836
02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:53.660
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is bullshit because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Usada testing showed him under the</v>

2837
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:55.070
<v Speaker 3>limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he is fine.</v>

2838
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they had some other wacky piss</v>

2839
02:01:57.351 --> 02:02:00.020
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not nearly as as accurate and</v>

2840
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:05.021
<v Speaker 3>that's where he tested high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they find them $100,000 now it's</v>

2841
02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:05.820
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2842
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:10.040
<v Speaker 3>it's went from one 65 down to 100 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2843
02:02:10.041 --> 02:02:12.000
<v Speaker 3>And then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to give him a 16 month</v>

2844
02:02:12.001 --> 02:02:14.900
<v Speaker 3>suspension instead of three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

2845
02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:16.040
<v Speaker 3>And they were going to give him five</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

2846
02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just gave vandelay three years.</v>

2847
02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw that.</v>

2848
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:02:20.091 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 3>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the vangely thing is</v>

2850
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:23.810
<v Speaker 3>they did it just before he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

2851
02:02:23.811 --> 02:02:24.920
<v Speaker 3>fade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or in pride.</v>

2852
02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Now if he goes or in rise in rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>

2853
02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm horizon probably never die,</v>

2854
02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 3>so he's going to fight or and rise in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he will have violated his band so</v>

2855
02:02:34.401 --> 02:02:37.400
<v Speaker 3>that it will essentially keep him out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting in the United States forever.</v>

2856
02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2857
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.440
<v Speaker 3>that's a sneaky thing they did right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2858
02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people aren't pointing that</v>

2859
02:02:41.871 --> 02:02:43.940
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they kept that guy on the shelf.</v>

2860
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:46.160
<v Speaker 3>They told him he's banned for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fuck with them.</v>

2861
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:49.070
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't give him a hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kept postponing the hearing.</v>

2862
02:02:49.071 --> 02:02:53.000
<v Speaker 3>Then coincidentally right after the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a big fight,</v>

2863
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.950
<v Speaker 3>he gets a for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2864
02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.600
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna fight in August,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2865
02:02:55.650 --> 02:02:58.150
<v Speaker 3>in a rising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then immediately they hit him with</v>

2866
02:02:58.151 --> 02:03:01.660
<v Speaker 3>his three year and I think he's only 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>months in the,</v>

2867
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:05.330
<v Speaker 3>for the original suspension from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time that where they caught him to</v>

2868
02:03:05.331 --> 02:03:07.340
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's only 17 months.</v>

2869
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:08.690
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's the case,</v>

2870
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2871
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.200
<v Speaker 3>that's a year and five months is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys still got another year and a half</v>

2872
02:03:12.201 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he can't fight fader.</v>

2873
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 3>He can't get that payday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or he can go and say,</v>

2874
02:03:16.761 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to finish my career in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Kinda,</v>

2875
02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:19.371
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got,</v>

2876
02:03:19.371 --> 02:03:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to be sad for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fans over here.</v>

2877
02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:25.070
<v Speaker 3>What was the most sad thing was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>those crazy videos he was doing or</v>

2878
02:03:25.330 --> 02:03:28.100
<v Speaker 3>saying the UFC is disrespecting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete and they're paying it and then</v>

2879
02:03:28.101 --> 02:03:29.390
<v Speaker 3>the UFC is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2880
02:03:29.391 --> 02:03:32.360
<v Speaker 3>well we're going to tell everybody how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much money you made and then you found</v>

2881
02:03:32.361 --> 02:03:34.220
<v Speaker 3>out vendorlink made $9 million and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2882
02:03:34.230 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2883
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:36.314
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wait,</v>

2884
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:38.500
<v Speaker 3>that's not poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah Dude,</v>

2885
02:03:38.501 --> 02:03:40.840
<v Speaker 3>you made 9 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like yeah,</v>

2886
02:03:40.841 --> 02:03:42.960
<v Speaker 3>and he only won a couple of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2887
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously so a fucking legend and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the all time greats and one of</v>

2888
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had to pick like three favorite</v>

2889
02:03:51.561 --> 02:03:53.660
<v Speaker 3>fighters is in that top three pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2890
02:03:53.690 --> 02:03:55.580
<v Speaker 3>He was so much fun to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>

2891
02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:59.350
<v Speaker 3>when you saw vandelay Roland is risks</v>
<v Speaker 3>before those fights in the garage.</v>

2892
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Looking at that over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2893
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:05.120
<v Speaker 3>He was chaos man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is making what makes the cro cop</v>

2894
02:04:05.121 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 3>knock out of him even more impressive is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cro cop showed the difference.</v>

2895
02:04:08.991 --> 02:04:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the difference between a guy's a</v>

2896
02:04:10.971 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 3>wild brawler and it new elite striking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2897
02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.193
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2898
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:16.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2899
02:04:16.170 --> 02:04:18.970
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel bad for vandelay the uh,</v>

2900
02:04:19.050 --> 02:04:21.990
<v Speaker 4>that reaction with those videos and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2901
02:04:22.170 --> 02:04:24.280
<v Speaker 4>he loved being a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2902
02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:26.070
<v Speaker 4>He loved Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I talked to him,</v>

2903
02:04:26.071 --> 02:04:30.330
<v Speaker 4>he loved the people and he loved that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people celebrated a big reason that he</v>

2904
02:04:30.331 --> 02:04:34.260
<v Speaker 4>loved fighting was the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he told me that he loved it.</v>

2905
02:04:34.530 --> 02:04:39.270
<v Speaker 4>And then somewhere between shale in</v>
<v Speaker 4>ejecting some chillness in there and a</v>

2906
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:41.880
<v Speaker 4>few other things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly the audience was negative</v>

2907
02:04:41.881 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 4>against vandelay for some length of</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2908
02:04:43.670 --> 02:04:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It was the ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.760
<v Speaker 3>He would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he acted like an asshole.</v>

2910
02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.790
<v Speaker 3>He acted like a bully and an asshole and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work.</v>

2911
02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And chill made him look like a fool.</v>

2912
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:55.940
<v Speaker 3>He may look very full verbally and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically when shale took them down,</v>

2913
02:04:55.941 --> 02:04:56.420
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2914
02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:58.140
<v Speaker 3>really pretty easily chill made them</v>

2915
02:04:58.270 --> 02:05:00.130
<v Speaker 4>like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where congress do you are now</v>

2916
02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:01.460
<v Speaker 4>caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has been compared to Emma.</v>

2917
02:05:01.461 --> 02:05:02.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though,</v>

2918
02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:03.891
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

2919
02:05:03.891 --> 02:05:05.810
<v Speaker 4>the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a similarity,</v>

2920
02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:09.530
<v Speaker 4>but you can't fuck with guys who are so</v>
<v Speaker 4>good at that you will lose.</v>

2921
02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:11.450
<v Speaker 4>You'll see they're going to affect your</v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

2922
02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:13.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2923
02:05:13.570 --> 02:05:17.360
<v Speaker 4>am I guy uriah figured out exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to tangle with conor Mcgregor.</v>

2924
02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Like he became kind of a friend and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a part of your writing.</v>

2925
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Does he's got a jovial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2926
02:05:24.110 --> 02:05:24.943
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2927
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:28.490
<v Speaker 4>He's a very likable looking like it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be your Ryan Dominick Cruz.</v>

2928
02:05:28.610 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about that?</v>

2929
02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:36.320
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons I wanted to fight and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to learn more about fighting,</v>

2930
02:05:36.321 --> 02:05:41.321
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that pointed me to</v>
<v Speaker 4>start pursuing this was uriah faber.</v>

2931
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Mark Harmonic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these little guys that fought,</v>

2932
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:44.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like admiring them,</v>

2933
02:05:44.931 --> 02:05:46.790
<v Speaker 4>want it to be like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was older.</v>

2934
02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2935
02:05:48.111 --> 02:05:50.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so I'm a Uriah guy.</v>

2936
02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he went to fight Frankie,</v>

2937
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:57.370
<v Speaker 4>my breakdown kind of was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's really fucking good at these</v>

2938
02:05:57.381 --> 02:06:01.490
<v Speaker 4>things and he's gets better at these</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain things,</v>

2939
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:03.620
<v Speaker 4>but we got to see some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>innovation out of them.</v>

2940
02:06:03.621 --> 02:06:08.180
<v Speaker 4>We have to see something else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uriah wins with drive and determination</v>

2941
02:06:08.181 --> 02:06:12.710
<v Speaker 4>and he'll win every position he wins by</v>
<v Speaker 4>with will and he wins by overwhelming</v>

2942
02:06:12.711 --> 02:06:14.120
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can mentally break you.</v>

2943
02:06:14.121 --> 02:06:16.580
<v Speaker 4>He can't be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that is great,</v>

2944
02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:20.570
<v Speaker 4>but we need something more technically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need some new tricks.</v>

2945
02:06:20.571 --> 02:06:22.640
<v Speaker 4>We need some shit that the other guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't know.</v>

2946
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:26.390
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have that against Frankie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say exactly the same thing for</v>

2947
02:06:26.391 --> 02:06:28.880
<v Speaker 4>dominick Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He must have some new things,</v>

2948
02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:30.710
<v Speaker 4>some other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just being the best.</v>

2949
02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Uriah isn't going to win them this</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2950
02:06:32.931 --> 02:06:35.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's got to have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>other different answers.</v>

2951
02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what he's doing as far as</v>

2952
02:06:38.031 --> 02:06:41.000
<v Speaker 3>working on his footwork and working to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to deal with,</v>

2953
02:06:41.001 --> 02:06:43.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean he has fought him twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the only guy to beat dominic.</v>

2954
02:06:43.851 --> 02:06:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He caught dominic with a guillotine</v>

2955
02:06:45.651 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>their first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wonder like what's,</v>

2956
02:06:48.681 --> 02:06:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean having the knowledge of having</v>
<v Speaker 3>faced dominic,</v>

2957
02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:55.430
<v Speaker 3>not just once but twice and especially</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second time he knocked him down a</v>

2958
02:06:55.431 --> 02:06:56.560
<v Speaker 3>couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2959
02:06:56.890 --> 02:06:59.240
<v Speaker 3>very close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like Tj was a very close,</v>

2960
02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:00.430
<v Speaker 3>very close.</v>

2961
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with uh,</v>

2962
02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:04.150
<v Speaker 4>with dominic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were to talk about this earlier.</v>

2963
02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:05.440
<v Speaker 4>So somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2964
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:06.730
<v Speaker 4>go figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's your guy.</v>

2965
02:07:06.731 --> 02:07:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Go figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How to beat Dominick Cruz,</v>

2966
02:07:08.051 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 4>you have three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck do we do that I could,</v>

2967
02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's going to be a big one client</v>

2968
02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:15.450
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slow those legs down.</v>

2969
02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think first of all,</v>

2970
02:07:17.911 --> 02:07:19.500
<v Speaker 3>you've got two things to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2971
02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.110
<v Speaker 3>dominic is most likely not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock you out with one punch.</v>

2972
02:07:22.111 --> 02:07:22.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2973
02:07:22.771 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 3>So he doesn't have the kind of knockout</v>
<v Speaker 3>power that a connor does where you</v>

2974
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:28.500
<v Speaker 3>really have to be terribly fearful about</v>
<v Speaker 3>closing that distance.</v>

2975
02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:32.450
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his number one asset is,</v>

2976
02:07:32.451 --> 02:07:34.140
<v Speaker 3>is movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chop those legs,</v>

2977
02:07:34.141 --> 02:07:35.260
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chop those legs.</v>

2978
02:07:35.261 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was him,</v>

2979
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go and train with the best</v>

2980
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Moitai leg kicker I could find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2981
02:07:41.410 --> 02:07:45.190
<v Speaker 3>I would seek them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say this is priority number one</v>

2982
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2983
02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.660
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on switching stances quite a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit because dominic,</v>

2984
02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:52.390
<v Speaker 3>we'll switch stances quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if your ride get switched to Ansys</v>

2985
02:07:52.391 --> 02:07:56.110
<v Speaker 3>and throw the power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a back leg kick from the low southpaw</v>

2986
02:07:56.111 --> 02:07:57.850
<v Speaker 3>position and from Orthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2987
02:07:57.851 --> 02:08:01.210
<v Speaker 3>that would open up those kicks and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and work on those combinations when</v>

2988
02:08:01.211 --> 02:08:05.170
<v Speaker 3>dominic is switching work on also going</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the top of the thigh,</v>

2989
02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:07.690
<v Speaker 3>if he's not in the right position to</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw the outside leg kick,</v>

2990
02:08:07.691 --> 02:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>if you were ordinarily going to incite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it like an outside,</v>

2991
02:08:10.511 --> 02:08:13.450
<v Speaker 3>but go across to take that right step</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go across the top of the thigh.</v>

2992
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Slick stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:17.800
<v Speaker 4>Slick stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is part of my mcgregor breakdown</v>

2994
02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:18.580
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2995
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:19.990
<v Speaker 4>AH,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of little elements.</v>

2996
02:08:19.991 --> 02:08:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

2997
02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:23.520
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2998
02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.580
<v Speaker 4>it was Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was asking him about fighting Max</v>

2999
02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:29.500
<v Speaker 4>Holloway and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3000
02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:30.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys who moved,</v>

3001
02:08:30.481 --> 02:08:31.750
<v Speaker 4>they're long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be lateral,</v>

3002
02:08:31.751 --> 02:08:32.920
<v Speaker 4>all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

3003
02:08:33.190 --> 02:08:35.710
<v Speaker 4>we have to keep him in the headlights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3004
02:08:35.711 --> 02:08:39.010
<v Speaker 4>So we were a car and our headlights kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of go out on an angle.</v>

3005
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:41.950
<v Speaker 4>If we keep them in that lit area of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>headlights,</v>

3006
02:08:41.951 --> 02:08:43.780
<v Speaker 4>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't want to be there.</v>

3007
02:08:43.810 --> 02:08:45.520
<v Speaker 4>He wants to be outside of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what are we doing?</v>

3008
02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Small steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's making grand movements,</v>

3009
02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 4>but if we keep our headlights lined up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're working at angles,</v>

3010
02:08:51.581 --> 02:08:54.310
<v Speaker 4>the way a goalie looks at dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

3011
02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.130
<v Speaker 4>we make small steps and small</v>
<v Speaker 4>adjustments to keep them in the</v>

3012
02:08:57.131 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 4>headlights.</v>

3013
02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 4>Then when he goes to flee outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're quite simply the right kick is</v>

3014
02:09:01.151 --> 02:09:03.940
<v Speaker 4>the barrier that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the left kick is the barrier that</v>

3015
02:09:03.941 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we kind of shoe horn them into our</v>

3016
02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:10.390
<v Speaker 4>headlights as best as we can at Faber's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never really used leg kicks that way,</v>

3017
02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked.</v>

3018
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a great idea if we can just</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep them in those headlights.</v>

3019
02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:19.370
<v Speaker 4>And as he goes to flee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that extra weapon of the leg starts to,</v>

3020
02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:22.960
<v Speaker 4>if our headlights are a certain width,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the leg becomes the barrier to keep him</v>

3021
02:09:22.961 --> 02:09:24.760
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's gotta be a starting point.</v>

3022
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.420
<v Speaker 3>How crazy it'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faber reunited with Duane Ludwig,</v>

3023
02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.120
<v Speaker 3>but they buried all the bullshit God</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

3024
02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't happen because now that he's</v>

3025
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:36.610
<v Speaker 3>with Tj and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've said so much bad shit about each</v>

3026
02:09:36.611 --> 02:09:39.610
<v Speaker 3>other and I don't think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is too bad.</v>

3027
02:09:39.611 --> 02:09:41.980
<v Speaker 3>But he needs someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3028
02:09:41.981 --> 02:09:44.530
<v Speaker 3>he needs someone who's going to really</v>
<v Speaker 3>tighten up those,</v>

3029
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:47.800
<v Speaker 3>those footwork movements in those leg</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick movements.</v>

3030
02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 3>But if we saw a totally different Uriah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that he comes out of hands up</v>

3031
02:09:51.641 --> 02:09:53.500
<v Speaker 3>high and just starts attacking those</v>
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>

3032
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:54.663
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

3033
02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:56.250
<v Speaker 4>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3034
02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:57.760
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3035
02:09:57.761 --> 02:09:59.750
<v Speaker 4>with the memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's Sa that,</v>

3036
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jorgensen when uriah fought Jorgenson,</v>

3037
02:10:02.411 --> 02:10:05.050
<v Speaker 4>that was my favorite performance ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

3038
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:08.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Duane Ludwig was cornering him and</v>

3039
02:10:08.591 --> 02:10:10.750
<v Speaker 4>he did something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We see Tj do a lot,</v>

3040
02:10:11.290 --> 02:10:14.170
<v Speaker 4>I call it like a shell game or like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cue ball and cups.</v>

3041
02:10:14.230 --> 02:10:16.000
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got three cups,</v>

3042
02:10:16.210 --> 02:10:19.080
<v Speaker 4>which one has the ball when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Tj,</v>

3043
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:21.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the changes this level,</v>

3044
02:10:21.011 --> 02:10:24.130
<v Speaker 4>obviously that can be a takedown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can also from there he comes up</v>

3045
02:10:24.131 --> 02:10:26.010
<v Speaker 4>with the right upper cut from the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>spot.</v>

3046
02:10:26.011 --> 02:10:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It comes up with the left high kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has takedowns,</v>

3047
02:10:28.690 --> 02:10:31.090
<v Speaker 4>he has so many things and it all centers</v>
<v Speaker 4>on that,</v>

3048
02:10:31.330 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 4>that position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fucking shows how smart Duane</v>

3049
02:10:34.161 --> 02:10:36.680
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have these wrestlers in wrestling,</v>

3050
02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:39.980
<v Speaker 4>they have this level change spot that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be the home to many of our</v>

3051
02:10:39.981 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 4>attacks.</v>

3052
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:43.370
<v Speaker 4>And uriah did that awesomely against</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jorgenson.</v>

3053
02:10:43.371 --> 02:10:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Now Jorgensen's not dominick Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he did it so beautifully.</v>

3054
02:10:46.371 --> 02:10:50.270
<v Speaker 4>The level change became a starting point</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like eight different options.</v>

3055
02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Tj tried to use that with crews,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but dominick Cruz literally one.</v>

3056
02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:56.690
<v Speaker 4>When a magician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a magician,</v>

3057
02:10:56.691 --> 02:10:59.450
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to do a trick on me or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedian trust to tell you a joke.</v>

3058
02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 4>You like a fucking hurt all these jugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I've seen all these tricks.</v>

3059
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:05.360
<v Speaker 4>You see a magician can't do that to</v>
<v Speaker 4>another magician.</v>

3060
02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:07.550
<v Speaker 4>So cruise just wouldn't play with Paul a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cup game.</v>

3061
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:08.870
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll dance around out here.</v>

3062
02:11:08.871 --> 02:11:11.420
<v Speaker 4>You Chase me around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put your ball and cups on like a little</v>

3063
02:11:11.421 --> 02:11:13.010
<v Speaker 4>trolley and try to convince me to play</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3064
02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll just kick them off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3065
02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.650
<v Speaker 4>And so that he's just different like and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cruises.</v>

3066
02:11:18.651 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 4>So fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's so brilliant,</v>

3067
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:21.800
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3068
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.670
<v Speaker 4>And that goes right back to that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>growth mindset.</v>

3069
02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:28.430
<v Speaker 4>When the guy had fucked up legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3070
02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:31.280
<v Speaker 4>well I still got to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll learn more about fighting.</v>

3071
02:11:31.281 --> 02:11:34.310
<v Speaker 4>I'll learn to explain it better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll learn to analyze it better.</v>

3072
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.460
<v Speaker 4>I'll make myself understand it more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used,</v>

3073
02:11:37.461 --> 02:11:39.920
<v Speaker 4>instead of that being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well two years down the tubes,</v>

3074
02:11:39.921 --> 02:11:43.760
<v Speaker 4>it was like two years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to gain other skills and other</v>

3075
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.010
<v Speaker 4>applicable skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it made them way better.</v>

3076
02:11:46.011 --> 02:11:47.810
<v Speaker 4>He's way better cause he had that</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgery,</v>

3077
02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:49.970
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if he just was in the gym and he</v>

3078
02:11:49.971 --> 02:11:51.440
<v Speaker 4>never was forced to take that time.</v>

3079
02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you're probably right.</v>

3080
02:11:53.011 --> 02:11:56.190
<v Speaker 3>And he's one of my favorite analysts</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks down fights into,</v>

3081
02:11:56.191 --> 02:11:59.220
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to making</v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes in the striking,</v>

3082
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:02.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving yourself open to get hit.</v>

3083
02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:05.220
<v Speaker 3>He's so good at not getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best things.</v>

3084
02:12:05.221 --> 02:12:10.221
<v Speaker 3>He is so good at explaining how to not</v>
<v Speaker 3>get hit or why someone made a mistake in</v>

3085
02:12:11.461 --> 02:12:12.294
<v Speaker 3>getting hit.</v>

3086
02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's funny too.</v>

3089
02:12:15.421 --> 02:12:18.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met him like once I,</v>

3090
02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:19.980
<v Speaker 4>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was Tj and him,</v>

3091
02:12:20.130 --> 02:12:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I was asking him about the fight and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>could see him going,</v>

3092
02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:24.900
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get kinda knows about fighting</v>

3093

<v Speaker 4>I liked that about even the way he does</v>

3096
02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:34.560
<v Speaker 4>analysis or commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't really give a fuck.</v>

3097
02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:36.870
<v Speaker 4>You asked me to analyze some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to analyze.</v>

3098
02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.040
<v Speaker 3>He's doing it like mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3099
02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One plus one is one whether you want,</v>

3100
02:12:40.711 --> 02:12:41.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Ryan was one is to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even count with that one.</v>

3102
02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Plus one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>

3103
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:45.403
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck was saying,</v>

3104
02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's putting it together in a really</v>

3105
02:12:48.321 --> 02:12:49.970
<v Speaker 3>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious manner.</v>

3106
02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:53.690
<v Speaker 3>And if it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to enjoy his personality</v>

3107
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:55.880
<v Speaker 3>in order to appreciate the brilliance of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying.</v>

3108
02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like his personality and I think</v>

3109
02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate guy.</v>

3110
02:13:00.171 --> 02:13:02.000
<v Speaker 3>We only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a little bit of commentary</v>

3111
02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:04.550
<v Speaker 3>together aside and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed it.</v>

3112
02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:08.090
<v Speaker 3>I really enjoyed like being able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bounce ideas off of them and ask</v>

3113
02:13:08.091 --> 02:13:11.120
<v Speaker 3>questions and I would like to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a bunch of different kinds of</v>

3114
02:13:11.121 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 3>fighters too because guys who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like him,</v>

3115
02:13:13.341 --> 02:13:15.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe like a Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of my favorite,</v>

3116
02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:19.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Damien Maia Far Neil Magni,</v>

3117
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:20.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3118
02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait to interview him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to know like what adjustments</v>

3119
02:13:24.351 --> 02:13:26.630
<v Speaker 3>he was making when he couldn't tap him</v>
<v Speaker 3>from his back.</v>

3120
02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:30.290
<v Speaker 3>And then he eventually did get it and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was explaining to me how he saw that he</v>

3121
02:13:30.291 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 3>was defending on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we started turning them towards the</v>

3122
02:13:32.251 --> 02:13:35.550
<v Speaker 3>other side and setting them up to defend</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that side so he could catch them on</v>

3123
02:13:35.551 --> 02:13:36.700
<v Speaker 3>the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3124
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.551
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3125
02:13:37.551 --> 02:13:38.790
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so important.</v>

3126
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everything.</v>

3127
02:13:39.751 --> 02:13:44.751
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 3>about mma is analization of technique.</v>

3128
02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And having that fighter explained to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

3129
02:13:50.041 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it illuminates things in such a</v>

3130
02:13:51.571 --> 02:13:53.430
<v Speaker 3>beautiful way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I say,</v>

3131
02:13:53.431 --> 02:13:54.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you see that was his,</v>

3132
02:13:54.931 --> 02:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw when he kept blocking on this</v>

3133
02:13:57.481 --> 02:14:02.481
<v Speaker 3>side or he kept moving towards that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was going to try to pretend that I</v>

3134
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 3>was gonna do the same thing I was doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3135
02:14:04.410 --> 02:14:05.490
<v Speaker 3>but set them up for a difference.</v>

3136
02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:08.850
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that level of like,</v>

3137
02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.810
<v Speaker 4>his skill level is so incredibly mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bogglingly hi.</v>

3138
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:14.830
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy for him to think in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3139
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:17.250
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of guys guys and fight number</v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

3140
02:14:17.251 --> 02:14:18.180
<v Speaker 4>He's like eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3141
02:14:18.181 --> 02:14:20.820
<v Speaker 4>and it's UFC fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like got to get the chuck got to</v>

3142
02:14:20.821 --> 02:14:22.400
<v Speaker 4>get the shotgun and I got to stop in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate cake.</v>

3143
02:14:22.401 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to get it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just the thought processes and</v>

3144
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:28.380
<v Speaker 4>as clear and concise as Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's like,</v>

3145
02:14:28.590 --> 02:14:31.680
<v Speaker 4>all right Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do this every day for my whole life.</v>

3146
02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:32.753
<v Speaker 4>And you don't</v>

3147
02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.680
<v Speaker 3>interesting about Maya as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else too.</v>

3148
02:14:35.890 --> 02:14:38.170
<v Speaker 3>He's really adamant about not wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt people.</v>

3149
02:14:38.230 --> 02:14:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3150
02:14:39.581 --> 02:14:40.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I,</v>

3151
02:14:40.451 --> 02:14:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him to the ground,</v>

3152
02:14:41.651 --> 02:14:43.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw a few punches just to open him</v>

3153
02:14:43.591 --> 02:14:44.980
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really wanted to get the choke.</v>

3154
02:14:44.981 --> 02:14:45.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3155
02:14:45.971 --> 02:14:47.660
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt him.</v>

3156
02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Mild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

3157
02:14:49.391 --> 02:14:51.520
<v Speaker 3>that is his real mentalities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bullshitting.</v>

3158
02:14:51.521 --> 02:14:53.050
<v Speaker 3>He's not trying to get you to like him</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

3159
02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:55.930
<v Speaker 3>but pretending to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more kind and peaceful.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really is not trying to hurt you.</v>

3161
02:14:57.791 --> 02:14:59.380
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just trying to win.</v>

3162
02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:05.360
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting isn't violence like it isn't,</v>

3163
02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:08.080

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3175
02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:32.980

<v Speaker 4>his feet,</v>

3176
02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:38.190

<v Speaker 4>the very best people you've ever watched</v>
<v Speaker 4>train with the best coaches at 18</v>

3184
02:15:56.651 --> 02:15:58.720
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is maybe what they're capable of</v>

3185
02:15:58.721 --> 02:16:01.750
<v Speaker 4>and he's 36 or whatever and he's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>super athlete,</v>

3186
02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:03.130
<v Speaker 4>so it'll be a little less than that.</v>

3187
02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.450
<v Speaker 4>He's fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucked,</v>

3188
02:16:04.451 --> 02:16:05.830
<v Speaker 4>he's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he made a big,</v>

3189
02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I feel for him because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at that when he started doing</v>

3190
02:16:09.701 --> 02:16:10.270
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3191
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:12.370
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly how we feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to fight.</v>

3192
02:16:12.371 --> 02:16:13.960
<v Speaker 4>I want it to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to get in there.</v>

3193
02:16:14.230 --> 02:16:17.520
<v Speaker 4>But there's that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3194
02:16:18.010 --> 02:16:20.080
<v Speaker 4>unconscious incompetence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3195
02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unconscious incompetence.</v>

3196
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:24.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about and you don't even know</v>

3197
02:16:24.761 --> 02:16:25.960
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what the fuck you're</v>

3198
02:16:25.961 --> 02:16:28.060
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you learn enough,</v>

3199
02:16:28.061 --> 02:16:30.610
<v Speaker 4>eventually you get incompetence where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3200
02:16:30.970 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3201
02:16:32.621 --> 02:16:35.050
<v Speaker 4>but at least I know that so I can start</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning some shit.</v>

3202
02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:37.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you'll get conscious competence</v>

3203
02:16:37.871 --> 02:16:38.621
<v Speaker 4>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3204
02:16:38.621 --> 02:16:40.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to think about it a consciously</v>

3205
02:16:40.811 --> 02:16:41.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm working at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

3206
02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:44.950
<v Speaker 4>and then the greats are unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 4>competence.</v>

3207
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to think Damien Maia</v>

3208
02:16:46.691 --> 02:16:49.890
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have to fucking think about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most that this,</v>

3209
02:16:49.930 --> 02:16:53.740
<v Speaker 4>he was unconsciously incompetent when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>said he wanted to fight in the UFC.</v>

3210
02:16:53.741 --> 02:16:57.190
<v Speaker 4>And I feel for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I feel the guy didn't know what he</v>

3211
02:16:57.191 --> 02:16:58.900
<v Speaker 4>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounded like a cool thing.</v>

3212
02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:02.640
<v Speaker 4>He's a driven guy who believes you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve what you put your mind to and</v>

3213
02:17:02.650 --> 02:17:05.670
<v Speaker 4>you work really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just was unconsciously incompetent.</v>

3214
02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have enough knowledge to know</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much could be acquired,</v>

3215
02:17:09.011 --> 02:17:12.430
<v Speaker 4>what he might be capable of if he worked</v>
<v Speaker 4>harder than anyone I've ever worked in</v>

3216
02:17:12.431 --> 02:17:15.370
<v Speaker 4>his life for 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't understand how low that would</v>

3217
02:17:15.371 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3218
02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:18.070
<v Speaker 4>still suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You suck.</v>

3219
02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:23.160
<v Speaker 3>No background in combat sports at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're 36 years old and you think</v>

3220
02:17:23.161 --> 02:17:25.020
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fight in the UFC and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

3221
02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:26.310
<v Speaker 3>That's almost insulting.</v>

3222
02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:27.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3223
02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:30.950
<v Speaker 4>and Kudos to him for giving it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand the motivation,</v>

3224
02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.960
<v Speaker 4>but I got mocked and ridiculed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking ended up with a concussion when</v>

3225
02:17:35.961 --> 02:17:38.620
<v Speaker 4>I did it on the smallest levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who are in fighting,</v>

3226
02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:40.490
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is this guy to come into</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting?</v>

3227
02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:43.700
<v Speaker 4>So I feel for him that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he probably really loves</v>

3228
02:17:43.701 --> 02:17:47.750
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just didn't know how shitty was the</v>

3229
02:17:47.751 --> 02:17:52.751
<v Speaker 4>maximum he could get at this stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that level of shininess is not good</v>

3230
02:17:53.181 --> 02:17:56.110
<v Speaker 4>enough to ever fight in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevermind debut in the US.</v>

3231
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:58.810
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's that much of an</v>

3232
02:17:58.811 --> 02:17:59.860
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3233
02:17:59.890 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Like when I watch him move I watches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing about him where I go</v>

3234
02:18:03.281 --> 02:18:03.701
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3235
02:18:03.701 --> 02:18:06.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're watching like a brock lesnar.</v>

3236
02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Brock Lesnar was up fucking freak</v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

3237
02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:11.060
<v Speaker 3>You would watch that guy who went out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3238
02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.790
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I saw barack</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

3239
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I saw him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I obviously had seen some videos</v>

3240
02:18:15.971 --> 02:18:19.360
<v Speaker 3>of him and wwe doing some spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

3241
02:18:19.361 --> 02:18:22.690
<v Speaker 3>He's a physical specimen beyond compare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3242
02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:26.080
<v Speaker 3>But when I saw him fight in k one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in uh,</v>

3243
02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 3>La when they fought and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took,</v>

3244
02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.730
<v Speaker 3>fought some Japanese gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took them down,</v>

3245
02:18:30.731 --> 02:18:32.410
<v Speaker 3>just smashed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking,</v>

3246
02:18:32.411 --> 02:18:36.520
<v Speaker 3>good luck keeping that motherfucker off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a totally different kind of a</v>

3247
02:18:36.521 --> 02:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>thing with this cm punk guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you guys a good looking guy who</v>

3248
02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:43.120
<v Speaker 3>speaks well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of charisma and that led</v>

3249
02:18:43.121 --> 02:18:47.170
<v Speaker 3>him to the top in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you watch his wrestling moves</v>

3250
02:18:47.410 --> 02:18:50.620
<v Speaker 3>like there's nothing because nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous about it.</v>

3251
02:18:50.621 --> 02:18:53.740
<v Speaker 3>You look at his body has nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous about his body.</v>

3252
02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:56.320
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing anything out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary.</v>

3253
02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:01.360
<v Speaker 4>He just didn't understand how lo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how little it could be a knowledge and</v>

3254
02:19:01.361 --> 02:19:04.180
<v Speaker 4>skill could be acquired in the time that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was going to look at.</v>

3255
02:19:04.181 --> 02:19:06.910
<v Speaker 4>He just couldn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now if you see him training,</v>

3256
02:19:06.970 --> 02:19:09.370
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know like it's looks where you'd</v>

3257
02:19:09.371 --> 02:19:11.920
<v Speaker 4>think a guy who worked really hard for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year and a half would be,</v>

3258
02:19:11.921 --> 02:19:13.680
<v Speaker 4>which is okay if you're just watch some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

3259
02:19:13.681 --> 02:19:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean see if you can find cm punk</v>

3260
02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:16.720
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.580
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be looking right now.</v>

3262
02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:20.830
<v Speaker 4>They had this no videos for me anytime</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

3263
02:19:20.831 --> 02:19:22.750
<v Speaker 4>There's like some stuff I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>from August.</v>

3264
02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Let's try that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought him up when I was talking</v>

3265
02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:30.170
<v Speaker 4>about Anthony Johnson is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first things that you find when you go</v>

3266
02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see what we got here.</v>

3267
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:33.650
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3268
02:19:33.890 --> 02:19:36.800
<v Speaker 4>what you find is that you can do these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3269
02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:39.770
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as the guy is moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not in balance anymore.</v>

3270
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you're in reality,</v>

3271
02:19:41.151 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you're not imbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the athleticism stuff here,</v>

3272
02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 4>this is not cm punk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh cm punk train exos performance</v>

3273
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:51.780

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3274
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:54.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's a guy working out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3275
02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:56.000
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't show too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3276
02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:59.360
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him hitting pads at one point.</v>

3277
02:19:59.361 --> 02:20:03.890
<v Speaker 4>I looked like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is jumping up on these boxes.</v>

3278
02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know.</v>

3279
02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3280
02:20:08.470 --> 02:20:10.900
<v Speaker 4>it's not a knock against him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3281
02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:12.840
<v Speaker 4>he just didn't know he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously.</v>

3282
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:15.300
<v Speaker 3>What's the main chief?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were talking,</v>

3283
02:20:15.330 --> 02:20:17.400
<v Speaker 3>it's mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's similar.</v>

3284
02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we see his golf.</v>

3285
02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

3286
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking white belts.</v>

3287
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

3288
02:20:23.370 --> 02:20:26.070
<v Speaker 3>And he's doing this with Hender Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3289
02:20:26.071 --> 02:20:29.180
<v Speaker 3>So as I'm sure doing some plank cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>all workouts,</v>

3290
02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 3>old goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3291
02:20:32.130 --> 02:20:33.000
<v Speaker 3>But even that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3292
02:20:33.001 --> 02:20:34.920
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is,</v>

3293
02:20:34.921 --> 02:20:38.670
<v Speaker 3>unless you're 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two years is not really a lot of time to</v>

3294
02:20:38.671 --> 02:20:39.910
<v Speaker 3>get prepared for something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've,</v>

3295
02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you're a 20 year old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can watch someone as a blue belt at</v>

3296
02:20:42.781 --> 02:20:46.770
<v Speaker 3>20 years and then in two years there a</v>
<v Speaker 3>black belt that is possible if you're</v>

3297
02:20:46.771 --> 02:20:48.510
<v Speaker 3>obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a fucking maniac,</v>

3298
02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:51.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're a real nut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're some Bj Penn when he was in</v>

3299
02:20:51.331 --> 02:20:53.940
<v Speaker 3>his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3300
02:20:53.941 --> 02:20:56.130
<v Speaker 3>this guy probably likes pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>likes to eat,</v>

3301
02:20:56.131 --> 02:20:57.900
<v Speaker 3>he's got bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got taxes,</v>

3302
02:20:57.901 --> 02:20:59.970
<v Speaker 3>he pays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably got media obligations.</v>

3303
02:21:00.390 --> 02:21:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Know you ain't ain't that easy to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a complete fucking obsessed freak.</v>

3304
02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.820
<v Speaker 3>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing is like athletically,</v>

3305
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:12.990
<v Speaker 3>his body did not develop to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a good buddy of mine who's very</v>

3306
02:21:12.991 --> 02:21:15.390
<v Speaker 3>good at Jujitsu and I brought him to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing gym once.</v>

3307
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:16.830
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3308
02:21:16.831 --> 02:21:18.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy was holding pads for him and I</v>

3309
02:21:18.361 --> 02:21:19.680
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

3310
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Like watching him hit pads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3311
02:21:21.781 --> 02:21:23.880
<v Speaker 3>fucking craill male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never going to get it.</v>

3312
02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:29.400
<v Speaker 3>It's like his body did not grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exploding like that.</v>

3313
02:21:29.511 --> 02:21:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His body moved slow and it was labored.</v>

3314
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:37.290
<v Speaker 3>It was like me trying to write a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>book with my left hand.</v>

3315
02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:41.820
<v Speaker 3>It was like awkward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just couldn't do it.</v>

3316
02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.710
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3317
02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:44.850
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these,</v>

3318
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:46.680
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not there.</v>

3319
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Is this him?</v>

3320
02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:50.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that you can tell us a white belt</v>

3321
02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:52.090
<v Speaker 4>who is trained a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3322
02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:53.710
<v Speaker 4>it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all right.</v>

3323
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3324
02:21:55.961 --> 02:21:57.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the white belt for life thing,</v>

3325
02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:01.120
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that smells of being,</v>

3326
02:22:01.121 --> 02:22:03.460
<v Speaker 4>trying not to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3327
02:22:03.810 --> 02:22:05.470
<v Speaker 4>us as he's a white belt for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3328
02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.280
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3329
02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:09.370
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it reeks of not being judged and</v>

3330
02:22:09.610 --> 02:22:11.510
<v Speaker 4>fighting is not a place you want to not</v>
<v Speaker 4>be jealous.</v>

3331
02:22:11.530 --> 02:22:13.060
<v Speaker 4>You're not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Bad.</v>

3332
02:22:13.061 --> 02:22:16.060
<v Speaker 4>This movement is not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's training with Henry Gracie,</v>

3333
02:22:16.090 --> 02:22:18.170
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's just a fucking wizard and an</v>

3334
02:22:18.310 --> 02:22:20.110
<v Speaker 4>awesome instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3335
02:22:20.111 --> 02:22:23.440
<v Speaker 4>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was space as he pushed that off</v>

3336
02:22:23.441 --> 02:22:24.274
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3337
02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:25.110
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3338
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:29.130
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this guy was still wrestling and he</v>

3339
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 4>loved fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking about,</v>

3340
02:22:31.051 --> 02:22:34.590
<v Speaker 4>was fighting on a small scale but to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff a lot and he had a great fight.</v>

3341
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:37.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a really good fight for a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's only been training for a while</v>

3342
02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:38.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3343
02:22:38.121 --> 02:22:41.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find somebody who's like at your level.</v>

3344
02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:45.170
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that's really bummed me</v>
<v Speaker 3>out is that he just got it back surgery</v>

3345
02:22:45.610 --> 02:22:48.170
<v Speaker 3>and back surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His fucking trickiest shit,</v>

3346
02:22:48.171 --> 02:22:50.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start chewing away at those discs.</v>

3347
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:53.090
<v Speaker 3>There's other ways to handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how bad it was,</v>

3348
02:22:53.091 --> 02:22:58.091
<v Speaker 3>but the guy was walking around and Matt</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown had a good conversation about that</v>

3349
02:22:58.431 --> 02:23:01.010
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading some of the things that</v>

3350
02:23:01.011 --> 02:23:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Matt Brown said about his own bulging</v>
<v Speaker 3>discs because he didn't have to get</v>

3351
02:23:03.861 --> 02:23:05.720
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He rehabilitated it,</v>

3352
02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.850
<v Speaker 3>but he does a lot of work down at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Westside barbell with Louie Simmons who</v>

3353
02:23:10.851 --> 02:23:13.820
<v Speaker 3>created the reverse hyper a machine that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have in the back here.</v>

3354
02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:17.030
<v Speaker 3>And I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought one specifically because I knew</v>

3355
02:23:17.031 --> 02:23:19.880
<v Speaker 3>that Louis had designed it because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying to get him to have back</v>

3356
02:23:19.881 --> 02:23:21.830
<v Speaker 3>surgery and he wasn't buying it and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

3357
02:23:21.831 --> 02:23:24.530
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was a way to compress the disc</v>

3358
02:23:24.531 --> 02:23:27.770
<v Speaker 3>to make it bulge out like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a way to decompress the</v>

3359
02:23:27.771 --> 02:23:29.540
<v Speaker 3>disk actively and strengthen the area.</v>

3360
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So He created that reverse hyper machine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3361
02:23:32.930 --> 02:23:37.310
<v Speaker 3>to see this guy go straight to back</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery like that when just a few days</v>

3362
02:23:37.311 --> 02:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>before that he was standing there</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to that Micky Gall kid and</v>

3363
02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:40.900
<v Speaker 3>Areola.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3364
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean what the fuck is going on man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you getting surgery?</v>

3365
02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:45.710
<v Speaker 3>You reviewed all the options.</v>

3366
02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:46.700
<v Speaker 4>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3367
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:50.840
<v Speaker 4>you know what he was saying to area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to fight on either one 99 or 200</v>

3368
02:23:50.841 --> 02:23:53.540
<v Speaker 4>I hope I got the juice to find out 200</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy.</v>

3369
02:23:53.541 --> 02:23:55.490
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't have any juice regardless</v>

3370
02:23:55.491 --> 02:23:59.610
<v Speaker 4>of our famous your juice meaning yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I dunno,</v>

3371
02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.440
<v Speaker 4>but I are you lying to Ariel then cause</v>
<v Speaker 4>you knew you were having back surgery or</v>

3372
02:24:03.441 --> 02:24:06.200
<v Speaker 4>you're lying now that it was weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you saw this guy fight.</v>

3373
02:24:06.450 --> 02:24:08.480
<v Speaker 4>But regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to pick on the guy because I</v>

3374
02:24:08.690 --> 02:24:13.550
<v Speaker 4>understand his motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think if somebody asks my opinion</v>

3375
02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:15.410
<v Speaker 4>if his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was my friend and he said,</v>

3376
02:24:15.411 --> 02:24:16.820
<v Speaker 4>why do you think I should do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

3377
02:24:16.970 --> 02:24:20.210
<v Speaker 4>why don't you come out and have a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>interest in conversation with somebody.</v>

3378
02:24:20.211 --> 02:24:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Somebody know Ariel's his friend and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

3379
02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:24.910
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went and I explored this for a long</v>

3380
02:24:24.911 --> 02:24:25.250
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3381
02:24:25.250 --> 02:24:27.470
<v Speaker 4>I found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found some incredible things in</v>

3382
02:24:27.471 --> 02:24:28.640
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gave me this,</v>

3383
02:24:28.641 --> 02:24:32.420
<v Speaker 4>I learned this stuff and what I</v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered was there's no way I could</v>

3384
02:24:32.421 --> 02:24:33.470
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

3385
02:24:33.471 --> 02:24:37.280
<v Speaker 4>It would have been an insult to fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I learned enough to know it and now</v>

3386
02:24:37.281 --> 02:24:38.810
<v Speaker 4>that I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to work for the UFC.</v>

3387
02:24:38.811 --> 02:24:40.760
<v Speaker 4>I want to do some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to contribute.</v>

3388
02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:43.640
<v Speaker 4>People would look and go honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3389
02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:45.890
<v Speaker 4>That's one of those things we never see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so refreshing.</v>

3390
02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Just come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I s I trained my ass off,</v>

3391
02:24:48.591 --> 02:24:52.040
<v Speaker 4>but what I found was only a further</v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciation for fucking everybody in</v>

3392
02:24:52.041 --> 02:24:56.480
<v Speaker 4>this gym and all these fighters and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned enough to barely to understand</v>

3393
02:24:56.481 --> 02:24:57.950
<v Speaker 4>that I barely know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

3394
02:24:58.070 --> 02:25:00.350
<v Speaker 4>but now that I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to do some other stuff and</v>

3395
02:25:00.351 --> 02:25:01.400
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd all probably go,</v>

3396
02:25:01.401 --> 02:25:02.390
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

3397
02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:03.290
<v Speaker 4>That's what he should do.</v>

3398
02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he can't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he definitely could fight.</v>

3399
02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that a year is nearly</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough time to fight in the UFC.</v>

3400
02:25:10.941 --> 02:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>I think that's preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think anybody could fight at a</v>

3401
02:25:14.781 --> 02:25:18.500
<v Speaker 3>commensurate level of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could find someone who is at your</v>

3402
02:25:18.501 --> 02:25:21.710
<v Speaker 3>level has been training as well as long</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you have and have an amateur fight.</v>

3403
02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 3>There's absolutely nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>not</v>

3404
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:28.380
<v Speaker 1>being the best in the world are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being at a world championship or a world</v>

3405
02:25:28.381 --> 02:25:29.770
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC level.</v>

3406
02:25:29.771 --> 02:25:31.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3407
02:25:31.181 --> 02:25:32.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing at all.</v>

3408
02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:36.280
<v Speaker 1>When insults a lot of peoples that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped right into the UFC and he did so</v>

3409
02:25:36.281 --> 02:25:39.750
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because like he's notoriety,</v>

3410
02:25:39.810 --> 02:25:41.800
<v Speaker 1>he has notoriety and when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>

3411
02:25:41.801 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 1>he was a boxing champion or a wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

3412
02:25:44.261 --> 02:25:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Like brock was NCAA national champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3413
02:25:47.231 --> 02:25:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you got to look at brock and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3414
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the guy can actually do it.</v>

3415
02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3416
02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:55.030
<v Speaker 1>you never wrestled in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never wrestled in college.</v>

3417
02:25:55.210 --> 02:25:57.370
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a white belt in Jujitsu.</v>

3418
02:25:57.580 --> 02:25:58.920
<v Speaker 1>You're a white belt in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and to not strike until you sign a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

3421
02:26:04.930 --> 02:26:08.500
<v Speaker 1>That to me is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're having a conversation about maybe</v>

3422
02:26:08.501 --> 02:26:10.690
<v Speaker 1>fighting in the UFC in two years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You start training yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't wait.</v>

3424
02:26:12.941 --> 02:26:15.700

<v Speaker 1>a trading striking,</v>

3425
02:26:15.730 --> 02:26:19.120
<v Speaker 1>that's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know went to the right place.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got fantastic training there from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel won delay to uh,</v>

3429
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:35.190

<v Speaker 1>who's just amazing,</v>

3430
02:26:35.381 --> 02:26:38.590

<v Speaker 1>a great gym.</v>

3431
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:39.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that,</v>

3432
02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:42.400
<v Speaker 1>if I was thinking about fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be one of the places that I</v>

3433
02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:43.260
<v Speaker 1>would consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3434
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:46.140
<v Speaker 1>he did the same thing that Tristar for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasa,</v>

3435
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:48.010
<v Speaker 1>hobby alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3436
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:51.640
<v Speaker 1>matt human just got mad at him right on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking genius man.</v>

3437
02:26:51.641 --> 02:26:54.820
<v Speaker 1>He's got damn jeans and he's the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>low key of all of them.</v>

3438
02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear a peep out of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Timmy.</v>

3439
02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Tris and him are like symbiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Demetrius is Matt Hume's cruise</v>

3440
02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:04.000
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows everything about fighting for</v>

3441
02:27:04.001 --> 02:27:04.450
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

3442
02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Research study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved the martial arts,</v>

3443
02:27:06.311 --> 02:27:08.950
<v Speaker 1>pursuing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for all the truths of martial</v>

3444
02:27:08.951 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And along comes this super athlete and</v>

3445
02:27:11.201 --> 02:27:12.730
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to invest a couple of years,</v>

3446
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:14.530
<v Speaker 1>see if he really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

3447
02:27:14.531 --> 02:27:17.710
<v Speaker 1>He's really becoming his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he learns incredibly well.</v>

3448
02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:20.140
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart person.</v>

3449
02:27:20.290 --> 02:27:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then once he gets to that level,</v>

3450
02:27:22.481 --> 02:27:26.350
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I'm going to commit my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life to making you the champion and</v>

3451
02:27:26.351 --> 02:27:30.340
<v Speaker 1>symbiotically Matt trains for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically transferred them like he's</v>

3452
02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:33.010
<v Speaker 1>his training partner most of the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a fucking genius.</v>

3453
02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:36.820
<v Speaker 1>That symbiotic one on one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't much of that in the in the</v>

3454
02:27:36.821 --> 02:27:39.040
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not many fighters that have one</v>

3455
02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:41.200
<v Speaker 1>brilliant coach that commits most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>

3456
02:27:41.350 --> 02:27:43.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find someone who's willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

3457
02:27:43.511 --> 02:27:46.720
<v Speaker 1>who and then forget about someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the knowledge and the ability that</v>

3458
02:27:46.721 --> 02:27:47.290
<v Speaker 1>hume has.</v>

3459
02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's not just a knowledgeable guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very similar and for us as a</v>

3460
02:27:50.651 --> 02:27:53.650
<v Speaker 1>hobby and that he's not just incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable,</v>

3461
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but he's also incredibly physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of like for Ross is fucking</v>

3462
02:27:58.091 --> 02:28:00.900
<v Speaker 1>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got nasty kickboxing skills and</v>

3463
02:28:00.901 --> 02:28:02.650
<v Speaker 1>nasty Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3464
02:28:02.651 --> 02:28:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and his knowledge is very deep and wide</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the same thing can be said</v>

3465
02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:09.490
<v Speaker 1>of Matt Hume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare to find a guy like those</v>

3466
02:28:09.491 --> 02:28:13.870
<v Speaker 1>two guys I admire for us and I liked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much and I just spoke with him the</v>

3467
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:16.750
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the phone before I went in to do the</v>

3468
02:28:16.751 --> 02:28:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was working on something with like,</v>

3469
02:28:18.811 --> 02:28:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I go and I love the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant,</v>

3470
02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3471
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.950
<v Speaker 4>the one differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got 50 students so he,</v>

3472
02:28:24.951 --> 02:28:28.040
<v Speaker 4>and he makes them great and he gives</v>
<v Speaker 4>them real time and he dedicates himself</v>

3473
02:28:28.041 --> 02:28:30.350
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this guy is basically one of a</v>

3474
02:28:30.351 --> 02:28:35.351
<v Speaker 4>handful and that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for us also seems to be that it's</v>

3475
02:28:36.831 --> 02:28:38.840
<v Speaker 4>such an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts seems to have this</v>

3476
02:28:38.841 --> 02:28:42.560
<v Speaker 4>interesting path where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come along and you learn some moves</v>

3477
02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:46.070
<v Speaker 4>and then you've learned how kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it works and then you do work on</v>

3478
02:28:46.071 --> 02:28:49.910
<v Speaker 4>your body and then you learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn and then you learn strategy and</v>

3479
02:28:49.911 --> 02:28:53.000
<v Speaker 4>then all these things growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inevitably you end up at a mental thing.</v>

3480
02:28:53.001 --> 02:28:56.120
<v Speaker 4>And then philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the study of martial arts ends up</v>

3481
02:28:56.121 --> 02:28:58.160
<v Speaker 4>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the study of philosophy,</v>

3482
02:28:58.161 --> 02:28:59.840
<v Speaker 4>how to live your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to learn,</v>

3483
02:28:59.841 --> 02:29:03.500
<v Speaker 4>how to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to become better in being a human</v>

3484
02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.060
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just in kickboxing.</v>

3485
02:29:05.061 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Like that inevitable result.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stay on the martial arts path</v>

3486
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:10.280
<v Speaker 4>long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inevitably you end up,</v>

3487
02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:13.250
<v Speaker 4>how can I be a better person?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how can I get better at being a</v>

3488
02:29:13.251 --> 02:29:14.980
<v Speaker 4>human being and frost was there</v>

3489
02:29:15.090 --> 02:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>that those things are part of what trips</v>
<v Speaker 3>people up.</v>

3490
02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:22.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of what trips you up in anything</v>

3491
02:29:22.021 --> 02:29:27.021
<v Speaker 3>you do is if you have personality flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you create problems in relationships</v>

3492
02:29:28.050 --> 02:29:30.900
<v Speaker 3>and in interrelationship conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3493
02:29:30.930 --> 02:29:34.500
<v Speaker 3>problems with friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with a wife or girlfriend or</v>

3494
02:29:34.501 --> 02:29:35.730
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

3495
02:29:35.731 --> 02:29:39.750
<v Speaker 3>those things that make you a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbor will also make you a bad</v>

3496
02:29:39.751 --> 02:29:43.380
<v Speaker 3>fighter because they get in your way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize you've created this</v>

3497
02:29:43.381 --> 02:29:44.340
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary Chi u,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3498
02:29:44.341 --> 02:29:47.430
<v Speaker 3>yelled at your fucking neighbor for no</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason because it's dog shit in your</v>

3499
02:29:47.431 --> 02:29:49.230
<v Speaker 3>lawn or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

3500
02:29:49.231 --> 02:29:52.320
<v Speaker 3>you created a problem that didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be there and now you've got,</v>

3501
02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:56.640
<v Speaker 3>you've got extra friction and conflict</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your life that's unnecessary instead</v>

3502
02:29:56.641 --> 02:30:01.020
<v Speaker 3>of creating some sort of a positive bond</v>
<v Speaker 3>by being a really good person.</v>

3503
02:30:01.021 --> 02:30:02.730
<v Speaker 3>So you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3504
02:30:02.731 --> 02:30:04.920
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's perfect but you learn somewhere</v>

3505
02:30:04.921 --> 02:30:06.030
<v Speaker 3>along those lines.</v>

3506
02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I if I just approached this in a better,</v>

3507
02:30:09.090 --> 02:30:10.590
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3508
02:30:10.591 --> 02:30:12.780
<v Speaker 3>more friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more open,</v>

3509
02:30:12.781 --> 02:30:15.240
<v Speaker 3>more nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I get this positive reward out</v>

3510
02:30:15.241 --> 02:30:17.310
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized that's the path.</v>

3511
02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.590
<v Speaker 3>The Path is to try to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

3512
02:30:19.770 --> 02:30:21.690
<v Speaker 3>The Path is to try to have more</v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

3513
02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 3>The Path has tried to be a better friend</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a,</v>

3514
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:25.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3515
02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:27.960
<v Speaker 3>a better training partner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3516
02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:33.120
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that you are pushing your</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend towards victory.</v>

3517
02:30:33.121 --> 02:30:35.850
<v Speaker 3>You're not trying to kick his ass cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he's tired.</v>

3518
02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:39.900
<v Speaker 3>You know that that's a real issue in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim's right when they'd run a gauntlet,</v>

3519
02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.000
<v Speaker 3>having a guy that is going to wear you</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

3520
02:30:42.001 --> 02:30:45.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to fuck you up</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he knows he can because he knows</v>

3521
02:30:45.631 --> 02:30:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you're tired because you just ran with</v>
<v Speaker 3>three other guys.</v>

3522
02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:52.830
<v Speaker 3>One thing you should drive me crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I would be training and I would be</v>

3523
02:30:52.831 --> 02:30:56.280
<v Speaker 3>exhausted and I would just see a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting down waiting,</v>

3524
02:30:56.430 --> 02:30:59.880
<v Speaker 3>taking the time off of training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not training that round.</v>

3525
02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:03.030
<v Speaker 3>And then as soon as this round is done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tries to jump on you.</v>

3526
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:05.850
<v Speaker 3>You just sitting down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why were you just sitting down?</v>

3527
02:31:06.010 --> 02:31:07.380
<v Speaker 3>And I'll call them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd go,</v>

3528
02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to rest?</v>

3529
02:31:08.911 --> 02:31:12.540
<v Speaker 3>And then you want to jump in while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fresh and other people are tired.</v>

3530
02:31:12.541 --> 02:31:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off man.</v>

3531
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:14.383
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:18.590
<v Speaker 4>I remember sparring with a guy and after</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked he was wearing like novelty</v>

3533
02:31:18.591 --> 02:31:20.620
<v Speaker 4>boxing gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody showed up to spine.</v>

3534
02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:21.900
<v Speaker 4>He had a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

3535
02:31:21.901 --> 02:31:25.200
<v Speaker 4>are you out of your fucking mind?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're looking for an edge over</v>

3536
02:31:25.201 --> 02:31:26.820
<v Speaker 4>people you're working with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3537
02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:29.160
<v Speaker 4>it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

3538
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.360
<v Speaker 4>those guys are almost always not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:31:31.410 --> 02:31:33.400
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes good enough to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3540
02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:36.270
<v Speaker 4>There's this guy that I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love working with.</v>

3541
02:31:36.271 --> 02:31:39.210
<v Speaker 4>I just really like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of the guys in Canada that</v>

3542
02:31:39.211 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 4>kind of end up being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3543
02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:45.930
<v Speaker 4>I kind of get to admire them over time</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were pioneers and maybe</v>

3544
02:31:45.931 --> 02:31:48.870
<v Speaker 4>some of them weren't even in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them got their Claude Patrick,</v>

3545
02:31:48.871 --> 02:31:51.870
<v Speaker 4>Sean Pearson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of those guys who were important,</v>

3546
02:31:51.871 --> 02:31:54.090
<v Speaker 4>Canadian pioneers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>harmonic and,</v>

3547
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:56.220
<v Speaker 4>and Pat [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those guys.</v>

3548
02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Joe Dirksen who was a quilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You admire those guys.</v>

3549
02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:01.860
<v Speaker 4>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never got to the UFC and he's in his</v>

3550
02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:03.900
<v Speaker 4>probably close to 40 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Adrian wooly,</v>

3551
02:32:03.901 --> 02:32:06.390
<v Speaker 4>and he was like the best one 25 are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going.</v>

3552
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:08.430
<v Speaker 4>And when I would go and I had a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up,</v>

3553
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.780
<v Speaker 4>I wanted some rounds with Willie and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason I wanted them was one,</v>

3554
02:32:12.781 --> 02:32:14.790
<v Speaker 4>he would push you really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but two,</v>

3555
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:18.860
<v Speaker 4>he hurt me one time and he's very</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive and he hurt me one time and</v>

3556
02:32:18.861 --> 02:32:20.820
<v Speaker 4>my leg wobbled and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I circled,</v>

3557
02:32:20.821 --> 02:32:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I saw him take the time to let me</v>
<v Speaker 4>recover.</v>

3558
02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:27.060
<v Speaker 4>And that's literally the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>training partner.</v>

3559
02:32:27.061 --> 02:32:30.930
<v Speaker 4>You want him to push you so hard as</v>
<v Speaker 4>close to a fight as you can handle right</v>

3560
02:32:30.931 --> 02:32:34.900
<v Speaker 4>now and understand what you can handle</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not take you past that point.</v>

3561
02:32:34.901 --> 02:32:35.950
<v Speaker 4>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3562
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:39.780
<v Speaker 4>and he was literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was ornery and aggressive,</v>

3563
02:32:39.781 --> 02:32:43.710
<v Speaker 4>but I loved having him in the rotation</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the last week of your four or five or</v>

3564
02:32:43.711 --> 02:32:45.600
<v Speaker 4>a couple of weeks of real training</v>
<v Speaker 4>before a fight.</v>

3565
02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:48.810
<v Speaker 4>Not because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just like training,</v>

3566
02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:50.910
<v Speaker 4>training partners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some gyms have,</v>

3567
02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Tristar has some guys they don't fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

3568
02:32:53.401 --> 02:32:56.280
<v Speaker 4>they're a huge important ingredient to</v>
<v Speaker 4>every one of those fighters.</v>

3569
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:59.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about you're getting</v>

3570
02:32:59.351 --> 02:33:04.310
<v Speaker 4>that concussion and Jordan means what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened with me and he just retired a</v>

3571
02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:05.270
<v Speaker 4>really young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3572
02:33:05.370 --> 02:33:10.370
<v Speaker 4>You know his dad just fought recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His Dad's like 45 just enormous and one</v>

3573
02:33:10.771 --> 02:33:13.980
<v Speaker 4>and his dad is a cool dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly.</v>

3574
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:16.780
<v Speaker 4>We talked to Jordan after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like 20 feet.</v>

3575
02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:19.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got like 30 plus fights.</v>

3576
02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:22.520
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you super talented.</v>

3577
02:33:22.530 --> 02:33:24.900
<v Speaker 4>You see what he did to my pile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3578
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:26.370
<v Speaker 4>My piles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beryllium,</v>

3579
02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:30.750
<v Speaker 4>my piles are super fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tiago Alba's for he took that body kill.</v>

3580
02:33:30.751 --> 02:33:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Props to Tiago,</v>

3581
02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:36.130
<v Speaker 4>figuring a way through that first round</v>
<v Speaker 4>and landing that body kick and taking</v>

3582
02:33:36.131 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 4>your out.</v>

3583
02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:40.620
<v Speaker 4>But then for have me in retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really shocking.</v>

3584
02:33:40.650 --> 02:33:42.930
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing so what I'm going to say is</v>

3585
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:43.840
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know Jordan,</v>

3586
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:45.270
<v Speaker 4>I like Jordan very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much.</v>

3587
02:33:45.271 --> 02:33:47.340
<v Speaker 4>His father and I are very good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3588
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:52.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there I picked up bits and pieces of</v>

3589
02:33:52.141 --> 02:33:54.330
<v Speaker 4>him kind of figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3590
02:33:54.331 --> 02:33:58.530
<v Speaker 4>I'll get paid real good money when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of at the top.</v>

3591
02:33:58.950 --> 02:34:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>

3592
02:34:00.001 --> 02:34:03.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm fighting like top five guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm finding like Tiago El Vez level</v>

3593
02:34:03.481 --> 02:34:04.830
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm there.</v>

3594
02:34:05.430 --> 02:34:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Jordan wants to be rich and Jordan wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be successful in life in some of</v>

3595
02:34:09.421 --> 02:34:11.430
<v Speaker 4>those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at least he's told me that.</v>

3596
02:34:11.850 --> 02:34:14.820
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't say anything about pay or</v>
<v Speaker 4>any of that stuff,</v>

3597
02:34:14.970 --> 02:34:18.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's right the top and he's not becoming</v>

3598
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:21.860
<v Speaker 4>wealthy enough for what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my guests.</v>

3599
02:34:22.170 --> 02:34:23.430
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

3600
02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:26.740
<v Speaker 4>he loves fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one day he loved other stuff too.</v>

3601
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:27.521
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

3602
02:34:27.521 --> 02:34:29.620
<v Speaker 4>I didn't again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing,</v>

3603
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:31.060
<v Speaker 4>but a guy like him was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3604
02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:34.840
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have as much sex in high school</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a lot of other guys did because I was</v>

3605
02:34:34.841 --> 02:34:35.950
<v Speaker 4>training all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3606
02:34:35.951 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go on fishing trips as much as</v>
<v Speaker 4>other guys because I was training all</v>

3607
02:34:38.681 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3608
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.410
<v Speaker 4>drinking beer on Saturdays is really</v>
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

3609
02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 4>Like all of those things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're 25,</v>

3610
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:45.010
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3611
02:34:45.130 --> 02:34:47.950
<v Speaker 4>and man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having the guts,</v>

3612
02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:51.910
<v Speaker 4>the smartness to identify and the guts</v>
<v Speaker 4>to quit something.</v>

3613
02:34:52.330 --> 02:34:55.410
<v Speaker 4>We all as a society think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't quit anything you driven.</v>

3614
02:34:55.420 --> 02:34:58.720
<v Speaker 4>You do go do it for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To really analytically look and go,</v>

3615
02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:02.980
<v Speaker 4>this will not give me what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if I achieve the results I will</v>

3616
02:35:02.981 --> 02:35:03.280
<v Speaker 4>achieve.</v>

3617
02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't want or are not enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I will step away.</v>

3618
02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:09.910
<v Speaker 4>I admire that like fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3619
02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:13.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rock bands and I'm trying to think of</v>

3620
02:35:13.211 --> 02:35:15.550
<v Speaker 4>somebody in particular aerosmith or</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone like that.</v>

3621
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:19.480
<v Speaker 4>The fuck is this guy still doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going up there playing it might love it,</v>

3622
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:24.340
<v Speaker 4>but why is he on American idol?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He needs to still be on tv or he needs</v>

3623
02:35:24.341 --> 02:35:26.620
<v Speaker 4>an audience or needs to be worshiped or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3624
02:35:26.621 --> 02:35:28.270
<v Speaker 4>You made all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made all the great records.</v>

3625
02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:30.850
<v Speaker 4>Go and sit on a beach somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who go,</v>

3626
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:32.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done enough of this stuff.</v>

3627
02:35:32.111 --> 02:35:34.780
<v Speaker 4>I think I would move on to other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should admire those people cause</v>

3628
02:35:34.781 --> 02:35:35.710
<v Speaker 4>they're really rare.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

3633
02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3634
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.681
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3635
02:35:46.681 --> 02:35:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He became very religious and I heard</v>

3636
02:35:51.511 --> 02:35:54.210
<v Speaker 3>that he was going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd heard some rumors that he was going</v>

3637
02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:56.200
<v Speaker 3>to be a cleric or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3638
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:59.640
<v Speaker 3>He was a pretty devout Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened,</v>

3639
02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:01.590
<v Speaker 3>but he was another guy and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3640
02:36:01.650 --> 02:36:03.120
<v Speaker 3>that guy was so talented.</v>

3641
02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:06.150
<v Speaker 4>I used to manage some UFC fighters a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple all the way up.</v>

3642
02:36:06.151 --> 02:36:10.050
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really to learn everything I</v>

3643
02:36:10.051 --> 02:36:12.450
<v Speaker 4>could do to learn any angle off fight or</v>
<v Speaker 4>manager,</v>

3644
02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:14.610
<v Speaker 4>if I could carry the bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever I could do,</v>

3645
02:36:14.611 --> 02:36:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I came across this guy,</v>

3646
02:36:16.591 --> 02:36:18.000
<v Speaker 4>nick dinny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever remember him?</v>

3647
02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:18.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

3648
02:36:18.661 --> 02:36:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a managed nick can we got him to</v>

3649
02:36:20.731 --> 02:36:21.570
<v Speaker 4>the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is she?</v>

3650
02:36:21.571 --> 02:36:24.030
<v Speaker 4>We got sean shelby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fucking loved nick.</v>

3651
02:36:24.090 --> 02:36:26.310
<v Speaker 4>And you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go and watch his first fight or</v>

3652
02:36:26.311 --> 02:36:29.080
<v Speaker 4>as fights in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fought like a caveman.</v>

3653
02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:32.550
<v Speaker 4>The guy has a master's degree in</v>
<v Speaker 4>biochemistry.</v>

3654
02:36:32.551 --> 02:36:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I think he's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he fought,</v>

3655
02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:38.750
<v Speaker 4>he loved fighting like a caveman and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>retired because he said he is taking</v>

3656
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:40.710
<v Speaker 4>head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't like it.</v>

3657
02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He uh,</v>

3658
02:36:42.330 --> 02:36:44.760
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about it and he talked with</v>

3659
02:36:44.761 --> 02:36:45.594
<v Speaker 4>other people about it.</v>

3660
02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could I fight different ways?</v>

3661
02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he likes fighting like a caveman and</v>

3662
02:36:50.551 --> 02:36:52.950
<v Speaker 4>fighting like a caveman will result in</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain damage.</v>

3663
02:36:53.310 --> 02:36:57.960
<v Speaker 4>He got knocked out by Marlon Sandra and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pack a in a single queue.</v>

3664
02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:01.530
<v Speaker 4>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after he recovered from that,</v>

3665
02:37:01.531 --> 02:37:02.191
<v Speaker 4>when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3666
02:37:02.191 --> 02:37:04.740
<v Speaker 4>if I ever get another concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to retire.</v>

3667
02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:06.520
<v Speaker 4>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3668
02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:08.730
<v Speaker 4>the last fight he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a broken orbital bone and he</v>

3669
02:37:08.731 --> 02:37:12.210
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why am I waiting until after I've</v>

3670
02:37:12.211 --> 02:37:15.090
<v Speaker 4>sustained the damage to step away?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I giving,</v>

3671
02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:18.140
<v Speaker 4>saying it's okay to take one more large</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of damage if I'm going to step</v>

3672
02:37:18.141 --> 02:37:19.880
<v Speaker 4>away and let's just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's step away.</v>

3673
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:21.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3674
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:23.570
<v Speaker 4>he's a brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the most interesting or cool guy.</v>

3675
02:37:23.571 --> 02:37:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I haven't talked to him in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna make sure that I to send a,</v>

3676
02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.280
<v Speaker 4>give him a call or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's such a brilliant guy,</v>

3677
02:37:28.350 --> 02:37:29.280
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy.</v>

3678
02:37:29.281 --> 02:37:32.730
<v Speaker 3>And he's a guy who was using an example</v>
<v Speaker 3>of someone who's very wise and</v>

3679
02:37:32.731 --> 02:37:37.380
<v Speaker 3>recognizing the risk versus reward and</v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing the rewards not worth it</v>

3680
02:37:37.381 --> 02:37:38.220
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to.</v>

3681
02:37:38.310 --> 02:37:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's gonna come a time for all</v>

3682
02:37:40.771 --> 02:37:42.630
<v Speaker 3>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to decide like,</v>

3683
02:37:42.631 --> 02:37:45.150
<v Speaker 3>when is it over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3684
02:37:45.151 --> 02:37:50.040
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking about the pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting after something and being</v>

3685
02:37:50.041 --> 02:37:52.350
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with something and wanting</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

3686
02:37:52.770 --> 02:37:57.770
<v Speaker 3>There comes a time when that's no longer</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your mind and you're still on this</v>

3687
02:37:57.841 --> 02:38:00.720
<v Speaker 3>path because it's something you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>always done because you've been a</v>

3688
02:38:00.721 --> 02:38:03.120
<v Speaker 3>fighter for x amount of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what you're doing.</v>

3689
02:38:03.121 --> 02:38:06.360
<v Speaker 3>You're going into training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have that fire inside you</v>

3690
02:38:06.361 --> 02:38:09.690
<v Speaker 3>like you did when you first started or</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were improving or when you were</v>

3691
02:38:09.691 --> 02:38:11.670
<v Speaker 3>at your best and that's what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

3692
02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:12.721
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

3693
02:38:12.721 --> 02:38:13.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hard for people.</v>

3694
02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:17.730
<v Speaker 4>It's really hot at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've heard before as</v>

3695
02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:20.140
<v Speaker 4>people will allow Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pauline Polyman,</v>

3696
02:38:20.141 --> 02:38:21.960
<v Speaker 4>the nausea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had never pronounced in there as well,</v>

3697
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:24.660
<v Speaker 4>who is actually a brilliant commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

3698
02:38:24.661 --> 02:38:29.170
<v Speaker 4>very fucking love listening to his car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of my favorites in box of area.</v>

3699
02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:30.661
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3700
02:38:30.661 --> 02:38:33.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote an article about how his passion</v>

3701
02:38:33.091 --> 02:38:35.910
<v Speaker 4>and desire to get back to fighting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone told him he shouldn't,</v>

3702
02:38:35.911 --> 02:38:40.911
<v Speaker 4>but it's just enemy needs that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot be the motivating factor among</v>

3703
02:38:41.101 --> 02:38:43.410
<v Speaker 4>the reasons that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's 100% true.</v>

3704
02:38:43.411 --> 02:38:46.350
<v Speaker 4>It can't be is cause when you're 60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're still going to have that.</v>

3705
02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:50.400
<v Speaker 4>That's never going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that just having that does not mean</v>

3706
02:38:50.401 --> 02:38:52.590
<v Speaker 4>go fight cause you'll always have that</v>

3707
02:38:53.370 --> 02:38:55.860
<v Speaker 3>many pieces of a pie chart that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have in place.</v>

3708
02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're going to have it your</v>

3709
02:38:57.751 --> 02:38:59.790
<v Speaker 4>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's irrelevant whether you have it or</v>

3710
02:38:59.791 --> 02:39:01.230
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause you know you'll have it and one</v>

3711
02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:03.060
<v Speaker 4>day you're going to have to retire even</v>
<v Speaker 4>though you have it.</v>

3712
02:39:03.180 --> 02:39:05.550
<v Speaker 4>So that can't be a part of the decision</v>

3713
02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.381
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3741
02:40:05.410 --> 02:40:08.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he could try to sell this,</v>

3747
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.690
<v Speaker 1>because that would mean that he had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like 57 then.</v>

3748
02:40:24.691 --> 02:40:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I think if it's 67 next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine now.</v>

3749
02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

3750
02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3751
02:40:31.410 --> 02:40:33.250
<v Speaker 1>That's science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3752
02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so insane.</v>

3753
02:40:36.990 --> 02:40:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to say he's five [inaudible]</v>

3754
02:40:38.421 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 1>six I'm five eight I stood next to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude and maybe had lifts in his shoes,</v>

3755
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taller than me.</v>

3756
02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was to just pretend he's so</v>

3757
02:40:45.901 --> 02:40:47.170
<v Speaker 1>tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's some weird,</v>

3758
02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:49.380
<v Speaker 1>weird thing that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3759
02:40:49.381 --> 02:40:51.660
<v Speaker 1>They always like try to pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are tinier than they are.</v>

3760
02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Like three feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am five eight I don't wear lifts in my</v>

3761
02:40:56.881 --> 02:40:58.260
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have.</v>

3762
02:40:58.261 --> 02:41:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I have terrible posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm short as fuck stood next to him.</v>

3763
02:41:02.910 --> 02:41:07.770
<v Speaker 1>He's bigger than I expected him to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What everybody says,</v>

3764
02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to meet Tom Cruise because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody says these tiny too.</v>

3765
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:15.270
<v Speaker 1>He might not be tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that would be something</v>

3766
02:41:15.271 --> 02:41:17.730
<v Speaker 1>that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever where it's perceived as</v>

3767
02:41:17.731 --> 02:41:21.660
<v Speaker 1>undermining people just to love that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people love doing that.</v>

3768
02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>They love doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize you don't have to do that.</v>

3769
02:41:24.151 --> 02:41:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Ronda comes out and says that</v>

3770
02:41:27.451 --> 02:41:29.520
<v Speaker 1>she had a horrific experience and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3771
02:41:29.521 --> 02:41:30.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck her.</v>

3772
02:41:30.361 --> 02:41:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you reacting this way?</v>

3773
02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:34.050
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well she brought it on herself.</v>

3774
02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:36.270
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still choosing to have that</v>

3775
02:41:36.271 --> 02:41:38.700
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could easily have a different</v>

3776
02:41:38.701 --> 02:41:40.920
<v Speaker 1>response who could easily have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspective.</v>

3777
02:41:40.980 --> 02:41:44.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's a long path to improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an asshole.</v>

3778
02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:48.500
<v Speaker 1>You're like trying to improve a troll</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one sentence that's like not going</v>

3779
02:41:48.501 --> 02:41:49.334
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

3780
02:41:49.650 --> 02:41:50.341
<v Speaker 1>People also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3781
02:41:50.341 --> 02:41:53.400
<v Speaker 1>their life sucks and they see someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing as good as she was doing</v>

3782
02:41:53.401 --> 02:41:55.140
<v Speaker 1>when she was on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3783
02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:59.460
<v Speaker 1>was it sports illustrated call to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most dominant female athlete of all time</v>

3784
02:41:59.461 --> 02:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just so much hype and fanfare.</v>

3785
02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And then also there's all the shitty</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that she was saying to her</v>

3786
02:42:06.931 --> 02:42:10.580
<v Speaker 1>opponents and the way she was talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they'll like the Misha tate</v>

3787
02:42:10.581 --> 02:42:12.200
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he did the show with her and she</v>

3788
02:42:12.201 --> 02:42:14.280
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she would win the competitions.</v>

3789
02:42:14.281 --> 02:42:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

3790
02:42:15.211 --> 02:42:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And after the she beat her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she walked away.</v>

3791
02:42:16.981 --> 02:42:21.570
<v Speaker 1>When you shake her hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much fuel for the haters,</v>

3792
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:24.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels like you don't have a choice but</v>

3793
02:42:24.361 --> 02:42:26.840
<v Speaker 1>must hate like you do have of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3794
02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like sometimes when we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

3795
02:42:29.491 --> 02:42:32.370
<v Speaker 1>and I do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty of it as charged,</v>

3796
02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:35.370
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you're yelling out into</v>

3797
02:42:35.371 --> 02:42:36.204
<v Speaker 1>the abyss.</v>

3798
02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3799
02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.820
<v Speaker 1>it all you can do is hope that you keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>offering up.</v>

3800
02:42:41.821 --> 02:42:46.590
<v Speaker 1>That there is another choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're also a binary culture.</v>

3801
02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:49.440
<v Speaker 1>There was this article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the Tinder Ization of America.</v>

3802
02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:50.371
<v Speaker 1>We're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a swipe.</v>

3803
02:42:50.371 --> 02:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3804
02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Wanna fucker left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3805
02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that thought process,</v>

3806
02:42:55.471 --> 02:42:58.830
<v Speaker 1>that binary process has actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced how our culture,</v>

3807
02:42:58.831 --> 02:43:01.270
<v Speaker 1>thanks Rhonda Rousey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3808
02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:05.430
<v Speaker 1>is either the greatest athlete ever or</v>
<v Speaker 1>she fucking sucks and she's terrible.</v>

3809
02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:08.340
<v Speaker 1>She can lose and still be the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete ever.</v>

3810
02:43:08.341 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>She can still be a 99 out of a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't have that in our culture.</v>

3811
02:43:12.011 --> 02:43:16.420
<v Speaker 1>She's a left swipe or a right swipe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people only want one or the other.</v>

3812
02:43:16.421 --> 02:43:19.210
<v Speaker 1>They won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gray areas in everything in the</v>

3813
02:43:19.211 --> 02:43:21.130
<v Speaker 1>world and the gray areas where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty is,</v>

3814
02:43:21.131 --> 02:43:24.010
<v Speaker 1>it's where the interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating shit is and where our</v>

3815
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:26.920
<v Speaker 1>culture is making it so that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>look there.</v>

3816
02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Because of that swipe though is why a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real winner like conor is so spectacular</v>

3817
02:43:33.010 --> 02:43:37.420
<v Speaker 1>because with the amount of scrutiny with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of pressure that's on them to</v>

3818
02:43:37.421 --> 02:43:41.190
<v Speaker 1>still perform the way he did and when in</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 seconds by knockout,</v>

3819
02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:44.170
<v Speaker 1>then you are the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's also why people were</v>

3820
02:43:44.171 --> 02:43:46.420
<v Speaker 1>shitting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although after the fight so badly,</v>

3821
02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:48.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it was the greatest pound for</v>

3822
02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:50.020
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's terrible.</v>

3823
02:43:50.021 --> 02:43:52.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still among the greatest,</v>

3824
02:43:52.121 --> 02:43:54.970
<v Speaker 1>he had a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a decade of being the greatest.</v>

3825
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's now been surpassed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody or had a long career,</v>

3826
02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.180
<v Speaker 1>a lot of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Todd or damage.</v>

3827
02:44:01.390 --> 02:44:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Quite a lot of hard fights but plus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gym wars.</v>

3828
02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3829
02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And you talk about how they trained back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

3830
02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:10.180
<v Speaker 1>He used to live in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably train all day,</v>

3831
02:44:10.181 --> 02:44:15.181
<v Speaker 1>every day plus barn with any sour on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>

3832
02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean sours like an all time k one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3833
02:44:18.490 --> 02:44:20.490
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Carlos condit first kickbox</v>

3835
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:22.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

3836
02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:26.470
<v Speaker 1>He's got zero fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He falling out with a hundred fights.</v>

3837
02:44:26.770 --> 02:44:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to,</v>

3838
02:44:29.291 --> 02:44:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched uh,</v>

3839
02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:33.100
<v Speaker 1>much of that podcast that you did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and I mean I'm,</v>

3840
02:44:33.250 --> 02:44:35.350
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were saying vandelay would be one of</v>

3841
02:44:35.351 --> 02:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>your three favorites are at that those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things do change every time we would</v>

3842
02:44:38.290 --> 02:44:39.700
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would have diff once thinking</v>

3843
02:44:39.701 --> 02:44:41.630
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kindness is absolutely one of my</v>

3844
02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.700
<v Speaker 1>absolutely tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fifth round with lawler was just</v>

3845
02:44:45.701 --> 02:44:47.620
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he won that fight.</v>

3846
02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:50.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a very close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close fight.</v>

3847
02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Very close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3848
02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3849
02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:55.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I thought was beautiful,</v>

3850
02:44:56.290 --> 02:44:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really fucking matter to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was searched,</v>

3851
02:44:59.231 --> 02:45:02.020
<v Speaker 1>he was seeking that fight and he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

3852
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:06.670
<v Speaker 1>And what three guys sitting at the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it doesn't take anything away from</v>

3853
02:45:06.671 --> 02:45:11.230
<v Speaker 1>the 25 minute brilliant experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had that will affect him positively</v>

3854
02:45:11.231 --> 02:45:12.960
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3855
02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And what do you like to do it again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3856
02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:16.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was,</v>

3857
02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno man.</v>

3858
02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I still only got a few more left in him</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3859
02:45:19.841 --> 02:45:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3860
02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I think Carlos is a really smart guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's also got a lot of other</v>

3861
02:45:23.711 --> 02:45:27.640
<v Speaker 1>things that he could do with his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very intelligent and what made him</v>

3862
02:45:27.641 --> 02:45:30.820
<v Speaker 1>such a great fighter would make him</v>
<v Speaker 1>great at anything he chooses to do.</v>

3863
02:45:31.090 --> 02:45:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think he's got a realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of how much longer his body</v>

3864
02:45:35.890 --> 02:45:38.440
<v Speaker 1>can go through those kinds of training</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps and those kinds of fights.</v>

3865
02:45:38.470 --> 02:45:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the sour,</v>

3866
02:45:41.501 --> 02:45:42.334
<v Speaker 1>what's this first?</v>

3867
02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:44.290
<v Speaker 1>She's saying that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

3868
02:45:44.310 --> 02:45:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3869
02:45:44.891 --> 02:45:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3870
02:45:45.791 --> 02:45:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such great experience for him.</v>

3871
02:45:48.010 --> 02:45:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3872
02:45:48.851 --> 02:45:51.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me one of the great quotes when</v>

3873
02:45:51.281 --> 02:45:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure out more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting it and it was actually relevant</v>

3874
02:45:54.551 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 1>to what we're saying about dominick Cruz</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're talking about,</v>

3875
02:45:56.620 --> 02:46:00.790
<v Speaker 1>we showed the footwork drills and how he</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves and I asked conduct because he's</v>

3876
02:46:00.791 --> 02:46:02.590
<v Speaker 1>like that and he's very special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3877
02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:04.360
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3878
02:46:04.390 --> 02:46:05.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

3879
02:46:05.921 --> 02:46:08.920
<v Speaker 1>when you go into fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you working with pre planned</v>

3880
02:46:08.930 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 1>sequences?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll</v>

3881
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:13.670
<v Speaker 4>run sequence a twice or three times on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robbie and when he starts reacting to</v>

3882
02:46:13.671 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Speaker 4>sequence a or tricking with sequence b,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you running these things?</v>

3883
02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:17.990
<v Speaker 4>Are you improvising?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening?</v>

3884
02:46:17.991 --> 02:46:19.880
<v Speaker 4>And the way he put it was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

3885
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:23.930
<v Speaker 4>some of the time I'm reading the sheet</v>
<v Speaker 4>music and I'm just reading the sheet</v>

3886
02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:26.570
<v Speaker 4>music and playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And other times I just go off on a solo</v>

3887
02:46:26.571 --> 02:46:28.400
<v Speaker 4>and I just yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just improvise.</v>

3888
02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:33.700
<v Speaker 4>And that and Stephen Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mcgregor crews,</v>

3889
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.580
<v Speaker 4>holly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the best are doing there.</v>

3890
02:46:37.581 --> 02:46:40.270
<v Speaker 4>They have sheet music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes some nights the sheet music is</v>

3891
02:46:40.271 --> 02:46:41.810
<v Speaker 4>going to be killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's going to apply it,</v>

3892
02:46:41.811 --> 02:46:44.150
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other Times you got to go off on some</v>

3893
02:46:44.151 --> 02:46:46.910
<v Speaker 4>crazy jazz odyssey to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes they're a bit of both.</v>

3894
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Well that was a big thing with Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this recognizing where those patterns</v>

3895
02:46:50.511 --> 02:46:53.570
<v Speaker 4>were and being able to create something</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the moment.</v>

3896
02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:54.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3897
02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:56.420
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about Anderson versus</v>
<v Speaker 4>bisping?</v>

3898
02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was saying,</v>

3899
02:46:58.161 --> 02:47:01.190
<v Speaker 4>Roy Jones Jr was one of his favorites</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you saw what happened to Roy Johnson</v>

3900
02:47:01.191 --> 02:47:03.350
<v Speaker 4>when he got all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly it will happen eventually.</v>

3901
02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:06.920
<v Speaker 4>Is it now or is it in a year or is it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>five years?</v>

3902
02:47:06.921 --> 02:47:08.420
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3903
02:47:08.570 --> 02:47:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

3904
02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I played a troll game with Anderson</v>

3905
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Silva it and not with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sure.</v>

3906
02:47:17.281 --> 02:47:20.000
<v Speaker 4>Dog used to ask for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for predictions and I just picked</v>

3907
02:47:20.001 --> 02:47:22.510
<v Speaker 4>against Anderson on everyone because</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was picking at us.</v>

3908
02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:23.560
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3909
02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:25.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephan Bonner is going to defeat</v>

3910
02:47:25.461 --> 02:47:27.770
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva and be considered the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest it was,</v>

3911
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:29.350
<v Speaker 4>it was comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3912
02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:31.940
<v Speaker 4>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends who know me or people who follow</v>

3913
02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 4>our channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3914
02:47:33.021 --> 02:47:34.040
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3915
02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:37.640
<v Speaker 4>so when I say I think bisping's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they think I'm just still playing</v>

3916
02:47:37.641 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3917
02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:41.030
<v Speaker 4>But I do probably think that Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we picked her Anderson Silva,</v>

3918
02:47:41.210 --> 02:47:44.570
<v Speaker 4>we're picturing him in there against</v>
<v Speaker 4>forest in the greatest moments.</v>

3919
02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:49.520
<v Speaker 4>And that's not what I expect him to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't expect him to be like that</v>

3920
02:47:49.521 --> 02:47:52.160
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that he was one of the greatest</v>

3921
02:47:52.161 --> 02:47:55.160
<v Speaker 4>fighters of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it brilliant and beautiful to watch and</v>

3922
02:47:55.161 --> 02:47:57.860
<v Speaker 4>did incredible things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not diminished in any way.</v>

3923
02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:00.290
<v Speaker 4>What's fucked up is that wasn't that</v>
<v Speaker 4>long ago.</v>

3924
02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:03.470
<v Speaker 4>What's really crazy about him was</v>
<v Speaker 4>stephan bonner was like,</v>

3925
02:48:03.471 --> 02:48:05.720
<v Speaker 4>what was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2013 yeah,</v>

3926
02:48:05.721 --> 02:48:07.310
<v Speaker 4>12 or 13.</v>
<v Speaker 4>13.</v>

3927
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:11.720
<v Speaker 4>So four years ago he was the wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the greatest of all time.</v>

3928
02:48:11.721 --> 02:48:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Now he's barely hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took a whole year off.</v>

3929
02:48:14.841 --> 02:48:16.460
<v Speaker 4>He fought Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>broke his leg and a half,</v>

3930
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:18.770
<v Speaker 4>took a whole year off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3931
02:48:18.810 --> 02:48:23.810
<v Speaker 4>we will also broke his leg and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>tested positive after the Diaz fight</v>

3932
02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:25.550
<v Speaker 4>took that year off.</v>

3933
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>

3934
02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:29.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in some weird place right now.</v>

3935
02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:31.760
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what his body's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like.</v>

3936
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.240
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We me know bisping's accusing him to</v>

3937
02:48:34.241 --> 02:48:37.100
<v Speaker 4>taking steroids his whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be partly games and shit for</v>

3938
02:48:37.101 --> 02:48:39.160
<v Speaker 4>he might know something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3939
02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of those things hint to me,</v>

3940
02:48:42.381 --> 02:48:46.130
<v Speaker 4>point towards not expecting him to be as</v>
<v Speaker 4>best if he's not as best.</v>

3941
02:48:46.131 --> 02:48:48.800
<v Speaker 4>Michael Bisping is the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>underappreciated,</v>

3942
02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:51.530
<v Speaker 4>underrated and undervalued by his</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents.</v>

3943
02:48:51.531 --> 02:48:53.540
<v Speaker 4>Tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally really good.</v>

3944
02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:57.140
<v Speaker 4>He's not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got hard because smart punches,</v>

3945
02:48:57.141 --> 02:48:59.750
<v Speaker 4>not knockout punches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but enough to make you aware.</v>

3946
02:48:59.930 --> 02:49:02.450
<v Speaker 4>Everything he does is intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well placed.</v>

3947
02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:04.910
<v Speaker 4>He can get emotional and that might be</v>
<v Speaker 4>something Andrew Anderson will want to</v>

3948
02:49:04.911 --> 02:49:05.930
<v Speaker 4>play with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3949
02:49:05.931 --> 02:49:07.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

3950
02:49:07.530 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 4>I just</v>

3951
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.770
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not imagining Anderson Silva from</v>

3952
02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:13.170
<v Speaker 1>his highlight reels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm imagining a guy who had his leg</v>

3953
02:49:13.171 --> 02:49:16.830
<v Speaker 1>broken and half lost twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% of the fights he's had since then,</v>

3954
02:49:16.831 --> 02:49:18.960
<v Speaker 1>which was the diaz fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have.</v>

3955
02:49:18.961 --> 02:49:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we haven't seen him have really a</v>

3956
02:49:21.211 --> 02:49:25.020
<v Speaker 1>brilliant performance since you Shan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okami years back now.</v>

3957
02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Could he come out and be mind blowing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>

3958
02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Boehner was his last year before.</v>

3959
02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm kind of undervalue shoe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spectacular tentacular so yeah,</v>

3960
02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:39.480
<v Speaker 1>and he had many of them and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just cause I played picked against</v>

3961
02:49:39.481 --> 02:49:42.300
<v Speaker 1>them for a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my friends of ours where</v>

3962
02:49:42.301 --> 02:49:43.950
<v Speaker 1>people watch fighting were to think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like Addison.</v>

3963
02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:45.720
<v Speaker 1>So he's 40 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3964
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:50.460
<v Speaker 1>He's forties unless you're on some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 is 40 and it's hard to be on shit</v>

3965
02:49:50.461 --> 02:49:52.590
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost impossible.</v>

3966
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
