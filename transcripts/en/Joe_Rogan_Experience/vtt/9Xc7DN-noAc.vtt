00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Rogen very spiffy today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you sir.</v>

7
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 2>If this is a new look for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

8
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you've been rocking these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these big,</v>

9
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 2>gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you call those things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These concerts that you guys are doing?</v>

11
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 2>What do you speeches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

12
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 2>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Discussions is what I think of them as.</v>

13
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm discussing.</v>

14
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think it's kind of perverse to</v>

15
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>be discussing with a 3000 person </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

16
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because if you pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the audience,</v>

17
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly in the individuals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>

18
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:38.324
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly providing feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a discussion as far as I'm </v>

19
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Feedback in applause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughter.</v>

21
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they shout things out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shuffling.</v>

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Shuffling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Well really what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on track,</v>

24
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.513
<v Speaker 1>if you're where you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's dead silent and everyone's </v>

25
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>focused and listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if that's not happening,</v>

26
00:00:59.451 --> 00:00:59.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>there can be laughter and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

28
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.294
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hear noise from the </v>

29
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

30
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.103
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're pursuing a complicated topic </v>

31
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:11.784
<v Speaker 1>and you're paying attention and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>always looking at individual people in </v>

32
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.511
<v Speaker 1>the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:16.344
<v Speaker 1>and the first few rows because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all I can see because of the lights and </v>

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>trying to make sure that everyone's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>track with the talk and you know,</v>

35
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:24.964
<v Speaker 1>there's people just hear what their face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they gestured with your eyes and </v>

36
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>they shake their head and they nod and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things to pick up and if</v>

37
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:32.944
<v Speaker 1>you're not speaking with notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really pay attention to the </v>

38
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

39
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the dialog and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to</v>

40
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.714
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting thing you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have experienced in doing </v>

42
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 2>that with lectures and colleges and </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>

43
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.793
<v Speaker 2>But now it's the general public and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just pay to see it and you fill </v>

44
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 2>up these huge gigantic theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

45
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some of the places that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are doing it.</v>

46
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 2>Even Sam just got done doing one in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vancouver and she huge places to,</v>

47
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 2>to back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he asked.</v>

48
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It was about five hours of</v>

49
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>intense discussion over two days and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

50
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>we were supposed to talk for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>each night and then go to q and a,</v>

51
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>but we asked the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bret Weinstein,</v>

52
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>who was moderating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask the audience if they wanted to go to</v>

53
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>q and a or continue the discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>the response from the crowd was </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely continued that discussion and</v>

55
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>so we ended up talking for about two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half hours each night and again it was</v>

56
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the audiences along for the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were good discussions as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

58
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of marketed as a take down </v>

59
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:44.111
<v Speaker 1>in some sense Harris versus Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the discussion itself was an attempt</v>

60
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.373
<v Speaker 1>on Sam's part and my part to further our</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the topic and to bring </v>

61
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone along for the ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>for the journey so to speak.</v>

63
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you guys had two podcasts that you </v>

64
00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 2>did over the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>

65
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>these were the first meetings that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys hadn't person.</v>

66
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.903
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time I'd met Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the first one that you two had </v>

67
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:12.631
<v Speaker 2>was marred by this discussion about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is truth and it was a strange sort of a,</v>

68
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got stuck.</v>

69
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 2>You guys got kind of stuck in that first</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

70
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like the second one was much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

71
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He in both of you,</v>

72
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of recognize that there were some </v>
<v Speaker 2>errors made in the first podcast.</v>

73
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we agree on a definition in and let it </v>

74
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:30.474
<v Speaker 1>go and so that wasn't so good and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't in tip top shape for that first </v>

75
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:37.050
<v Speaker 1>discussion while over the second one for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter,</v>

76
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.423
<v Speaker 1>but they've been getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each discussion I've had with Sam has </v>

77
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>been getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as far as I'm concerned,</v>

78
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>and I think he feels the same way and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean we're taught,</v>

79
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to sort something out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

80
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:48.264
<v Speaker 1>really difficult and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between facts and values </v>

81
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which is parallel to the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between say,</v>

82
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:54.624
<v Speaker 1>objective truth and narrative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallel to the distinction between </v>

83
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.973
<v Speaker 1>scientific fact and religious truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things sort of are layered </v>

84
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:06.660
<v Speaker 1>on top of each other and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult topic.</v>

85
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.913
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not surprising that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking all of this discussion to even </v>

86
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.334
<v Speaker 1>vaguely get it straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a central bone of contention </v>

87
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.650
<v Speaker 1>among philosophers for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well probably forever,</v>

88
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 1>but certainly since the time of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of David Hume several hundred years.</v>

89
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.783
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the more fascinating things is </v>

90
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the realm of podcasting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of discussions,</v>

91
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 2>these long form live discussions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of enormous groups of people where</v>

92
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you go over very complex issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new thing.</v>

93
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>

94
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's greatly received </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the public,</v>

95
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys are selling out all over</v>

96
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.453
<v Speaker 1>Well one one I've really been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense of this say because I'm </v>

98
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:46.061
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

100
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Why am I selling out 3000 person </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditoriums and then,</v>

101
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just me.</v>

102
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Sam is doing it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something on a larger scale,</v>

103
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but very similar with your long form </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and,</v>

104
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this whole rise of,</v>

105
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>of what Barry Weiss described as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual dark web.</v>

106
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.873
<v Speaker 1>That's actually Eric Weinstein's coinage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a group of us that have </v>

107
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>been sort of clump together for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that aren't obvious,</v>

108
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>but I've been trying to figure that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I do these lectures.</v>

109
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Another thing I'm doing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures or the discussions is trying to</v>

110
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>continually further the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my ideas.</v>

111
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I use the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

112
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>the stage I'd say as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

113
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity in real time to think.</v>

114
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:32.514
<v Speaker 1>if you're surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't confuse yourself with the </v>

116
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:35.040
<v Speaker 1>wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>That that's a real mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be on top of the wave,</v>

118
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:38.334
<v Speaker 1>but you're not the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this long form discussion </v>

119
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>and the public hunger for that as best </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized like that,</v>

120
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a technological revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep one.</v>

121
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.263
<v Speaker 1>The technological revolution is online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video and audio immediately accessible </v>

122
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>to everyone all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that's done is it turned,</v>

123
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.543
<v Speaker 1>it's turned the spoken word into a tool </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has the same reach as the printed </v>

124
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.054
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a Gutenberg revolution in the </v>

125
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.544
<v Speaker 1>domain of video and audio and it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be even deeper than the original </v>

126
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Gutenberg revolution because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious how many people can read,</v>

127
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>but lots of people can listen and now it</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out so he got a little bit of that</v>

128
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>with TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

129
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>And you got a little bit of it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

130
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but there was bandwidth limitations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were really stringent,</v>

131
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.534
<v Speaker 1>especially in TV where you could get 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds if you were lucky in six </v>

132
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were stellar too,</v>

133
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.100
<v Speaker 1>to elucidate a complicated argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't do that.</v>

134
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything gets compressed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

135
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.311
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.144
<v Speaker 1>kind of oversimplified entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now all of a sudden we have this </v>

137
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.790
<v Speaker 1>forum for long form discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real long form discussion.</v>

138
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that everyone is way </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than we thought,</v>

139
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.253
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can have these discussions publicly </v>

140
00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's a great hunger for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see this parallel.</v>

141
00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this would be,</v>

142
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting evidence for this hypothesis?</v>

143
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.230
<v Speaker 1>The same thing's happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment world because you know,</v>

144
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.420
<v Speaker 1>tv made us think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:05.250
<v Speaker 1>we can handle a 20 minute sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

146
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 1>or maybe we can handle an hour and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half made for TV movie.</v>

147
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.043
<v Speaker 1>But then Netflix came along and Hbo as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well with the bandwidth restrictions </v>

148
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.820
<v Speaker 1>gone and all of a sudden it turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>

149
00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:16.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can handle 40.</v>

150
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Our complex multilayered narratives </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the characters shift,</v>

151
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.623
<v Speaker 1>where the complexity starts to reach the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same complexity as great literature and </v>

152
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:25.584
<v Speaker 1>there's a massive market for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that we're smarter </v>

153
00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:29.424
<v Speaker 1>than our technology revealed to us and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think those of us who've been placed in </v>

154
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>this intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark web group,</v>

155
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things we have in common.</v>

156
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.483
<v Speaker 1>We more or less have independent voices </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're not beholding to any </v>

157
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:41.784
<v Speaker 1>corporate masters except peripherally </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've been operating in this long </v>

158
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.220
<v Speaker 1>form space and the technology has </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitated that.</v>

159
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Speaker 1>And so all of a sudden it turns out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to people than we thought.</v>

160
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 1>And thank God for that.</v>

161
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm struggling with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

162
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to use the word hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be a,</v>

164
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.660
<v Speaker 2>a non acceptance or a resistance to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that anything of quality could come</v>

165
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:15.120
<v Speaker 2>out of this group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting to me and uh,</v>

166
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:15.954
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering why when I listened to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak or Sam or Eric or any of these </v>

167
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:21.794
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ben or Dave and I hear very interesting </v>

168
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 2>points and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are people resisting that?</v>

169
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 2>These are interesting points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they resisting this?</v>

170
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.943
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are beholden to mainstream </v>

171
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:35.654
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's newspapers or magazines or </v>

172
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:42.971
<v Speaker 2>television shows that feel trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they feel trapped by this format</v>

173
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:45.104
<v Speaker 2>that they're stuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very limiting format and it's a </v>

174
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 2>format that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion is like,</v>

175
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might as well be smoke signals or ham</v>

176
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 2>radio or something.</v>

177
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dumb.</v>

178
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

179
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.903
<v Speaker 2>this idea that we're going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials every 15 minutes and you </v>

180
00:09:00.371 --> 00:09:01.204
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in between you have 15 people </v>

181
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.541
<v Speaker 2>arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

182
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:04.374
<v Speaker 2>I watched a panel on CNN wants and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we counted 10 people that were </v>

183
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 2>trying to talk during this five minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>segment.</v>

184
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

185
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.603
<v Speaker 2>what genius thought that it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good idea to get 10 people struggling </v>

186
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:18.984
<v Speaker 2>for air time barking over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one saying anything that makes any </v>

187
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:23.364
<v Speaker 2>sense because everybody's talking over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to stand out and trying to </v>

188
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:27.174
<v Speaker 2>say the most outrageous things and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing like some of the resistance to </v>

189
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>this when we spend pretty far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.150
<v Speaker 2>from Sam and I lean more left and Ben </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leans more right and your,</v>

191
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>what you would call a classic liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Eric's very difficult to define.</v>

192
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 2>And Brett is fiercely progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are Brett Breton,</v>

193
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.253
<v Speaker 2>particularly very left wing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this desire to label and to have </v>

194
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 2>this diminishing label is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

195
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.600
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing or fascist.</v>

196
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>

197
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a couple of things going </v>

198
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:06.494
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of them is that the </v>

199
00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:09.944
<v Speaker 1>technological transformation that I laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then the other is that I do </v>

200
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.400
<v Speaker 1>believe that especially for the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftist types,</v>

201
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:17.234
<v Speaker 1>the whole notion of free speech among </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals is not only anathema but </v>

202
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.340
<v Speaker 1>also something that isn't possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>within their framework of reference.</v>

203
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to think this through </v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully because you know,</v>

204
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:30.464
<v Speaker 1>for free speech in some senses become </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified as a right wing issue and I </v>

205
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:34.011
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:36.290
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

207
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're radically left and you're</v>

208
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:40.274
<v Speaker 1>playing the identity politics game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually no such thing as free </v>

209
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:43.334
<v Speaker 1>speech because you're only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece of your group whether you </v>

210
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.780
<v Speaker 1>know it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't get to talk.</v>

211
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.330
<v Speaker 1>As Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to talk as like Joe Rogan,</v>

212
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchal White Guy.</v>

213
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.903
<v Speaker 1>Knots it and your audiences aren't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of your own opinions as an </v>

214
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:57.164
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're an attempt on your part </v>

215
00:10:59.121 --> 00:10:59.954
<v Speaker 1>whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify your position and the power </v>

216
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:05.150
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everything right now,</v>

217
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the technology and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of the mainstream media and,</v>

218
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 1>and this and this political polarization</v>
<v Speaker 1>all unite,</v>

219
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.630
<v Speaker 1>everything is turned into a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in the,</v>

220
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.493
<v Speaker 1>in the mainstream media and media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has to be cast as left versus </v>

221
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:21.554
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're criticizing the left and </v>

222
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:27.140
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're right and right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing and it has to be about politics.</v>

223
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

224
00:11:27.681 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be about philosophy,</v>

225
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be cast in political </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

226
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's also subject to a form of,</v>

227
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of well it,</v>

228
00:11:39.971 --> 00:11:44.030
<v Speaker 1>it's made more stupid than it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>by these terrible bandwidth limitations.</v>

229
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:44.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

230
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I've been on mainstream TV talk shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very strange experience because</v>

231
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

232
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Marshall Mcluhan said the medium is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

233
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:55.624
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The medium shapes the dialogue and it </v>

234
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't integrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate in,</v>

235
00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

236
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 1>in a tremendous way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful way.</v>

237
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>You go on a TV talk show and maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour long,</v>

238
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.883
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's five guests and you've got </v>

239
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>your eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

240
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.820
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be bright and chipper </v>
<v Speaker 1>and entertaining and intelligent,</v>

241
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.683
<v Speaker 1>sort of glitzy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it puts that facade of momentary </v>

242
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>charisma on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't play that out,</v>

243
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 1>you actually fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

244
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't start a long form </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion when you've got six minutes.</v>

245
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you're trying to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's deep and difficult,</v>

246
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.713
<v Speaker 1>well you want to talk about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the access they had and the </v>

247
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got your,</v>

248
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.323
<v Speaker 1>your six minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but turn into sort of a </v>

249
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>glitzy entertainer.</v>

250
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And so it cheapens everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that I think is</v>

251
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>happening is that as the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>media television in particular dies,</v>

252
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the quality people are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert like rats leaving a sinking ship.</v>

253
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're good routes if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality people,</v>

254
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:54.470
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

255
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.363
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ever more enticement to use </v>

256
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.163
<v Speaker 1>clickbait journalism to attract a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishing portion of the remaining </v>

257
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:02.831
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

258
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

259
00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:05.554
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the five major indices</v>
<v Speaker 1>of violent crime in the United States </v>

260
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 1>that they've declined by 50 percent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years,</v>

261
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

262
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 1>This includes violent gun crime by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

263
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>and yet the reports of violence in media</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gone up and up and up and up.</v>

264
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.421
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

265
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

266
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

267
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's click bait.</v>

268
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the equivalent of clickbait.</v>

269
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.283
<v Speaker 1>And then to turn everything into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarized political discussion takes no </v>

270
00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 1>real intellectual energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also driven by the death spiral</v>

271
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>of the classic media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

272
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's actually why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization seems to be so acute.</v>

273
00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is genuine,</v>

274
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.093
<v Speaker 1>but some of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it is the consequences of this </v>

275
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.154
<v Speaker 1>underlying technological transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the death throes of the smoke </v>

276
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 1>signals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally</v>

277
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying people,</v>

278
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:56.374
<v Speaker 2>especially radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to concede certain points whenever </v>

279
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:00.124
<v Speaker 2>they discuss things that this is so true</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so important because you see that </v>

280
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.893
<v Speaker 2>play out over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very little variation from the </v>

281
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:09.454
<v Speaker 2>official narrative when they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>important subjects or controversial </v>

282
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:13.744
<v Speaker 2>subjects and whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's transgender rights or </v>

283
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:19.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever's in the news.</v>

284
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 2>It's big and it's very popular right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

285
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.693
<v Speaker 2>There's these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these certain things that you're not </v>

286
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:27.964
<v Speaker 2>allowed to deviate from and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an insanely restrictive perspective and </v>

287
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 2>it who's establishing these norms like </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a staff question man?</v>

288
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is it?</v>

289
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.113
<v Speaker 1>I blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blame the universities and large part </v>

290
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:41.960
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They act this disciplines,</v>

291
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.803
<v Speaker 1>but that's only a partial answer because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities are also responding to </v>

292
00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 1>legislation like title nine so and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>

293
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>They've been driven into the and title </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine for people,</v>

294
00:14:53.651 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>so title nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>title nine.</v>

295
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Originally it was just a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation that that ensured that women</v>

296
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>would have equal access to sports events</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth at the universities.</v>

297
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.763
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was designed for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's become this umbrella </v>

298
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:06.974
<v Speaker 1>legislation that pushes equality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome essentially across every </v>

299
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:10.934
<v Speaker 1>possible dimension in the universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's been used as a weapon by the </v>

300
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>radical left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of that's driven by legislative</v>

301
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.104
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>

302
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.530
<v Speaker 1>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the reason that I think this is</v>

303
00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:26.170
<v Speaker 1>coming from the universities is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that this could.</v>

304
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these activists disciplines </v>

305
00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:28.984
<v Speaker 1>that are essentially subsidized by too </v>
<v Speaker 1>high to tuition fees and also by state </v>

306
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:35.730
<v Speaker 1>funding and they've produced an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure of,</v>

307
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 1>of activists and those activists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing everything they can to lay out the</v>

308
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:42.280
<v Speaker 1>theoretical structure for the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

309
00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:44.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a structure that involves.</v>

310
00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.640
<v Speaker 1>There's buzzwords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

311
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Diversity is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that means diversity by race and </v>

312
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.010
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity and sexual preference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

313
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.223
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if those have anything to do with </v>

314
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.290
<v Speaker 1>genuine diversity of idiation and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

315
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And there's no evidence that they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusivity.</v>

316
00:15:59.021 --> 00:16:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I've never even sure what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

317
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a marker for,</v>

318
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.953
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a code word in some sense for </v>

319
00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely deadly doctrine.</v>

320
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I think of all the mistakes that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left are making and the moderate</v>

321
00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:15.850
<v Speaker 1>left for not calling them out on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The equity doctrine is at the top of the</v>

322
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:18.010
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other associated things</v>

323
00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:19.660
<v Speaker 1>like white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one,</v>

324
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:20.494
<v Speaker 1>and systemic bias and which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute embarrassment from the </v>

325
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:26.674
<v Speaker 1>perspective of a of a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic psychologist because </v>

326
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.183
<v Speaker 1>psychological tests have been used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prove that there's this implicit bias </v>

327
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that that lurks everywhere and the tests</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't reliable and valid enough to make</v>

328
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:38.284
<v Speaker 1>that claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's even the people who've made the </v>

329
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:40.444
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The implicit association test have </v>

330
00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:42.604
<v Speaker 1>admitted except for Mazda and Banerji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the chairman of the Department of </v>

331
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.863
<v Speaker 1>Psychology at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've admitted that the tests aren't </v>

332
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>reliable and valid enough to be used for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purposes there'll be using for,</v>

333
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's also no evidence at all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these unconscious buying bias retraining</v>

334
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>seminars have any effect whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's positive.</v>

335
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense pushed by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

336
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.050
<v Speaker 1>the ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fulminations of the radical left.</v>

337
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Is there any benefit in having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations?</v>

338
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.673
<v Speaker 2>Talking about implicit biases and </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that there's an extreme </v>

339
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 2>pushback against racism or sexism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things and that even</v>

340
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 2>though these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

341
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.503
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that they're pushing might </v>

342
00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:28.814
<v Speaker 2>not be tested and proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of putting it out there in the </v>

343
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.633
<v Speaker 2>mainstream that there's a shift in </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in terms of like how </v>

344
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:41.720
<v Speaker 2>people will or won't accept racism or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism or homophobia or whatever else is</v>

345
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 2>being discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe it's far left,</v>

346
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's moving the needle towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it needs to be.</v>

347
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

348
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.170
<v Speaker 3>well that I think that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

349
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.093
<v Speaker 3>I certainly believed that there's space </v>
<v Speaker 3>and necessity for a constant dialogue </v>

350
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:58.254
<v Speaker 3>between the left and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is also something that I've been </v>

351
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 3>developing more particularly during </v>
<v Speaker 3>these lectures,</v>

352
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:02.874
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to lay out a couple of </v>

353
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 3>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that you have to move forward</v>

354
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do things and the reason you</v>

355
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:10.674
<v Speaker 3>have to do things is because while if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just sit there and don't do </v>

356
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you suffer and die.</v>

357
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>So that isn't an option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to move forward and you have to</v>

358
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 3>move forward towards valued things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to have the value hierarchy.</v>

359
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 3>It has to be hierarchy because one thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to be more important than another,</v>

360
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 3>or you can't do anything right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

361
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.400
<v Speaker 3>you're to split with your choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to do things,</v>

362
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.234
<v Speaker 3>you have to value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to value some things more than </v>

363
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

364
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to act out what you value </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the social environment because you're</v>

365
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 3>a social creature and you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do things alone.</v>

366
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.583
<v Speaker 3>Then as soon as you start to act out </v>
<v Speaker 3>things of value in the social </v>

367
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:43.584
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you inevitably produce a hierarchy and </v>

368
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 3>the reason you do that is because no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter what,</v>

369
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:48.474
<v Speaker 3>you're acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are way better at it than </v>

370
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:51.744
<v Speaker 3>others and and it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if it's basketball or </v>

371
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 3>hockey or plumbing or law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter.</v>

372
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 3>As soon as there's something valuable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're doing it collectively,</v>

373
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

374
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.630
<v Speaker 3>so then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

375
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.703
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy can get corrupt and rigid </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it stops rewarding competence </v>

376
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 3>and it starts rewarding criminality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

377
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 3>And so there's always the danger of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy will become corrupt.</v>

378
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 3>The right wingers say we really need the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies and we should abide by them.</v>

379
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.230
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of the Motif of patriotism </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

380
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

381
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

382
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and positive group identity.</v>

383
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 3>And the left wingers say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

384
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 3>but wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem here,</v>

385
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hierarchy can get corrupt and might</v>

386
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 3>and be because some people are way </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at it than others.</v>

387
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 3>You're going to produce a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed people at the bottom,</v>

388
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.820
<v Speaker 3>and that's not only good for not only </v>
<v Speaker 3>not good for the dispossessed people,</v>

389
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 3>it actually threatens the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

390
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to attend to the widows and the</v>

391
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the widows and the orphans.</v>

392
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now and then,</v>

393
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>now you can think about that as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternal problem.</v>

394
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't do without hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

395
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.493
<v Speaker 3>and that's the right wing claim in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense you can't do without hierarchies </v>

396
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 3>and they're valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also prone to corruption and</v>

397
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 3>they dispossessed people.</v>

398
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now that's an eternal problem.</v>

399
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.333
<v Speaker 3>The question is what you do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is there's no </v>

400
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:11.994
<v Speaker 3>final answer to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you have to do is you have to </v>

401
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:18.390
<v Speaker 3>have a left wing and you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>right wing and they have to talk all the</v>

402
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:19.224
<v Speaker 3>time about whether the hierarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy and whether or not it's </v>

403
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:22.044
<v Speaker 3>dispossessing too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the problem with that is is </v>

404
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.340
<v Speaker 3>that discussion can go too far because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right wingers can say hierarchy,</v>

405
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

406
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.130
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

407
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.963
<v Speaker 3>that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state is correct and everything's </v>

408
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the right wing.</v>

409
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:35.784
<v Speaker 3>Totalitarian types and the left can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will flatten everything so there's no </v>

410
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:40.044
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so both the left and the right can </v>

411
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:42.984
<v Speaker 3>go too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem is we don't know how to </v>

412
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:46.374
<v Speaker 3>define.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the problems is we know </v>

413
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>how to define</v>

414
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.873
<v Speaker 1>when the right goes too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we learned that after World War </v>

415
00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.673
<v Speaker 1>II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're making claims of </v>

416
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:53.554
<v Speaker 1>ethnic or racial superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to be put in a box and put off </v>

417
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

418
00:20:57.551 --> 00:20:58.384
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the dialogue anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious that the left can go too </v>

419
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 1>far even though they're necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>participants in the discussion.</v>

420
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know when to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to define when they've</v>

421
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 1>gone too far and have an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

422
00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:11.081
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

423
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

424
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>well that's the moderate leftists </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

425
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.393
<v Speaker 1>It's their moral responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociate themselves from the radicals </v>

426
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.444
<v Speaker 1>just as it's the moral responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable conservatives to dissociate </v>

427
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:25.250
<v Speaker 1>themselves from the Birch John Birch </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

428
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.880
<v Speaker 1>and Ku Klux Klan types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very important point.</v>

429
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem,</v>

430
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.943
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just the moderate left's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because even the people on the </v>

431
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 1>right don't know what to point to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say no.</v>

432
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You've gone too far as a leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've tried to.</v>

433
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated because I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

434
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.123
<v Speaker 1>It might be more than one policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the really deadly left this </v>

435
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:46.444
<v Speaker 1>presumption is equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as soon as you start talking </v>

436
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.804
<v Speaker 1>about equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be put in a box and put off </v>

437
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 1>the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the but.</v>

438
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't obvious why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't sound like you know,</v>

439
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.303
<v Speaker 1>white people overall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have the same guttural punch </v>

440
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.740
<v Speaker 1>that the excess of the right has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>equality of outcome.</v>

441
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

442
00:22:07.121 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it's bad because when you play it out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and there's endless evidence for</v>

443
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:11.644
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an instantaneously murderous </v>

444
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 1>doctrine and I think it's because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts so quickly into a victim.</v>

445
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Victimizer narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a great opportunity in the last</v>

446
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.103
<v Speaker 1>month and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got asked to write the preface to the </v>

447
00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>50th anniversary edition of [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>since Gulag archipelago,</v>

448
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 1>and so I've been writing that and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things sold units and did,</v>

449
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.933
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that made that book </v>

450
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>arguably the greatest work of nonfiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century,</v>

451
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.613
<v Speaker 1>it's in the top 10 anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to point out very clearly that the </v>

452
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:47.740
<v Speaker 1>excesses of the Russian revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>started right away.</v>

453
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.060
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that Lennon was a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and then Stellan came in,</v>

454
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.380
<v Speaker 1>corrupted everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Lennon was not a pretty good</v>

455
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:54.214
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revolution got bloody really fast </v>

456
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and what seemed to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you,</v>

457
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.073
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're starting to divide the world up </v>

458
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 1>into oppressor and oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

459
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oppressors.</v>

460
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.930
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that you can define </v>
<v Speaker 1>people multiple ways.</v>

461
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.913
<v Speaker 1>This is the intersectionality problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost everybody can be defined in </v>

462
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>terms of their group identity in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that makes them an oppressor.</v>

463
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.613
<v Speaker 1>So like if you're a black man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you could argue that you're </v>

464
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:20.914
<v Speaker 1>oppressed because you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the fact that you're a </v>

465
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>man and so does that make you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor or someone who's oppressed?</v>

466
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the revolution progresses,</v>

467
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 1>if there's any dimension along which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be categorized as an oppressor,</v>

468
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.253
<v Speaker 1>you end up dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the pathology of </v>

469
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 1>the equality of you or that you ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

470
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:40.744
<v Speaker 1>Did you end up rounded up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ended up being put into the </v>

471
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 1>oppressor camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

472
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>So there's only so far you can</v>

473
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.661
<v Speaker 3>go with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

474
00:23:46.661 --> 00:23:47.494
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't put all men in the oppressor </v>

475
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be no men left.</v>

476
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:50.684
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that is really sort of plays out </v>

477
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is how it plays out.</v>

478
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:55.664
<v Speaker 3>When we look for equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is how it played out in the Soviet </v>

479
00:23:59.030 --> 00:23:59.541
<v Speaker 3>Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And China,</v>

480
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:02.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know how many people died.</v>

481
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 3>The reasonable estimates look like about</v>
<v Speaker 3>$25 million.</v>

482
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 3>That's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not just,</v>

483
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.490
<v Speaker 3>that's not in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't families destroyed,</v>

484
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 3>that's just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in in Mao's China,</v>

485
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.050
<v Speaker 3>it might have approximated $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just internal repression.</v>

486
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.003
<v Speaker 3>And so what seems to happen as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide that the hierarchy is unfair </v>

487
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 3>because there are oppressors and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressed,</v>

488
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.510
<v Speaker 3>then you can go after the oppressors </v>
<v Speaker 3>with moral virtue.</v>

489
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.373
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no limit to the number of ways </v>

490
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 3>that you can categorize someone as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor.</v>

491
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.183
<v Speaker 3>The category just starts to expand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the communists killed all the </v>

492
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 3>socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It killed all the religious people.</v>

493
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.083
<v Speaker 3>They killed most of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed all the productive farmers </v>

494
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 3>and they killed the productive farmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they owned land,</v>

495
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe little house and a few cows.</v>

496
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.840
<v Speaker 3>To be a successful farmer in Russia at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

497
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 3>at the turn of the 20th century didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean you were rich.</v>

498
00:24:57.441 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just meant you weren't starving.</v>

499
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.333
<v Speaker 3>It's like they killed all those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were oppressors because </v>

500
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:03.134
<v Speaker 3>they had more than someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they defined it in order to </v>

501
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 3>get the people to rally against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

502
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

503
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the definition kept slipping because</v>

504
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:11.361
<v Speaker 3>we'll look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

505
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:12.590
<v Speaker 3>even now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

506
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 3>let's say we rally against the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

507
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

508
00:25:15.311 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 3>and those will be the money owners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

509
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:17.841
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

510
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:20.180
<v Speaker 3>who's in that group?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

511
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 3>everybody in North America is in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>group worldwide.</v>

512
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:24.584
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

513
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 3>but who sends the parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

514
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.420
<v Speaker 3>It's 34.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's $34,000</v>

515
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:32.420
<v Speaker 3>a year sets you in the one percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldwide,</v>

516
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.111
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

517
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:33.944
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so does that make all of us will pay </v>

518
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 3>basically everybody who lives above </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty in America in the one percent of</v>

519
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:39.320
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

520
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also by historical standards.</v>

521
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 3>And so the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the oppressor,</v>

522
00:25:44.091 --> 00:25:44.924
<v Speaker 3>we'll press narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you can multiply the oppressors </v>

523
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 3>endlessly and there's no end to going </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the.</v>

524
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.830
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you make a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can move the boundaries and then the</v>

525
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:57.290
<v Speaker 3>next person is the oppressor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then keep going.</v>

526
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.153
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you also see the interesting thing </v>

527
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:00.104
<v Speaker 3>too is that this is complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I've been thinking about this </v>

528
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 3>proclivity of the left to to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>members of the moderate left.</v>

529
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.673
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's the game part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game is being played as far as I can </v>

530
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideologically pathological game is,</v>

531
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm more virtuous than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now look,</v>

532
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 3>if you're on the on the radical left and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

533
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:22.754
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more virtuous than a right </v>

534
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:24.081
<v Speaker 3>winger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

535
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:24.914
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares that it's obvious because the </v>

536
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:27.130
<v Speaker 3>right wingers are are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

537
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 3>are pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so being more virtuous than them,</v>

538
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.723
<v Speaker 3>that's not much of an attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I have my moderate leftist </v>

539
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>compatriot standing right beside me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty damn virtuous,</v>

540
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:41.570
<v Speaker 3>but I'm even more virtuous than him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's a real.</v>

541
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.553
<v Speaker 3>That's a real attainment on my park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a moral attainment with no effort </v>

542
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:46.824
<v Speaker 3>on my part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I can figure out some way of </v>

543
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:49.044
<v Speaker 3>classifying that previously virtuous </v>
<v Speaker 3>person as an oppressor along some </v>

544
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden I get an increment,</v>

545
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.184
<v Speaker 3>my moral virtue and that happened all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time in these leftist revolutions </v>

546
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 3>run a muck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just a constant feature,</v>

547
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 3>so it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

548
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.403
<v Speaker 2>Why is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that's always puzzled </v>

549
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that the left is defined by.</v>

550
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.214
<v Speaker 2>There's like certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain values and one of them </v>

551
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.280
<v Speaker 2>is when you look at the right you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you automatically think of racism,</v>

552
00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 2>potential racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least a dislike for gay people.</v>

553
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Homophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There there's certain qualities that are</v>

554
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:31.584
<v Speaker 2>always attributed to conservatives and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's certain qualities are that </v>

555
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.963
<v Speaker 2>these are social things and that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite sure I understand like why is it </v>

556
00:27:39.961 --> 00:27:44.060
<v Speaker 2>that the left is always associated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>support of gay rights?</v>

557
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.750
<v Speaker 2>The left is always associated in support</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

558
00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all races and all genders.</v>

559
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the dispossessed issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

560
00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:54.640
<v Speaker 3>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

561
00:27:54.641 --> 00:27:55.474
<v Speaker 3>imagine that we make these hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there hierarchies that are devoted </v>

562
00:28:01.191 --> 00:28:02.024
<v Speaker 3>towards the goal and that the sum total </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all those hierarchies is something </v>

563
00:28:05.061 --> 00:28:08.890
<v Speaker 3>like the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I hate that word and use it,</v>

564
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that word at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

565
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.993
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's where we're speaking within </v>

566
00:28:12.081 --> 00:28:14.900
<v Speaker 3>the confines of that theory that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>defined in how you're using it.</v>

567
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.610
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by the Patriarch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

568
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the Patriarchy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

569
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.720
<v Speaker 3>is the sum total of all Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

570
00:28:20.721 --> 00:28:21.554
<v Speaker 3>So let's say it's or it's the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftist vision of the sum </v>

571
00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:27.470
<v Speaker 3>total of all Western hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always male.</v>

572
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the theory is that it's male</v>
<v Speaker 3>dominated and you know,</v>

573
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.930
<v Speaker 3>what is Patriarchy as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a funny thing because of course</v>

574
00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:36.764
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of sub elements of the </v>

575
00:28:38.241 --> 00:28:40.100
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy that aren't male dominated.</v>

576
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.080
<v Speaker 3>So Pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare for example,</v>

577
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.720
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the education system in general.</v>

578
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.793
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of places where these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these sub elements are female dominated </v>

579
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.960
<v Speaker 3>but so defined as the patriarchy and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define healthcare.</v>

580
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question Joe.</v>

581
00:28:55.491 --> 00:28:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happens if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

582
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.530
<v Speaker 3>if you have a sub element of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy,</v>

583
00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:02.930
<v Speaker 3>it's dominated by women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that still the patriarchy?</v>

584
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like the structure is still intact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still performing the same function.</v>

585
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Well now the women are running it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that the patriarchy?</v>

586
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

587
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:12.500
<v Speaker 3>we're all vague about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition is,</v>

588
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:15.310
<v Speaker 3>so we don't need to address that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the answers.</v>

589
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Here's some clear ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

590
00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Like a major corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of ceos are male.</v>

591
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think of that as part of the </v>

592
00:29:21.711 --> 00:29:25.010
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Government never been a male.</v>

593
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Men never been a female president of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vast majority of senators,</v>

594
00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:29.750
<v Speaker 3>congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

595
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

596
00:29:30.741 --> 00:29:31.940
<v Speaker 3>so I guess we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

597
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:32.774
<v Speaker 3>the patriarchy is all those eleMents of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical structure that are still </v>

598
00:29:35.571 --> 00:29:37.520
<v Speaker 3>dominated by men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement,</v>

599
00:29:37.521 --> 00:29:39.800
<v Speaker 3>military mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly male,</v>

600
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a.</v>

601
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a peculiar definition because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means You have to.</v>

602
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 3>You have to a fraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hate the patriarchy into pieces.</v>

603
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.083
<v Speaker 3>You can't you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can no longer talk about it as </v>

604
00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:51.304
<v Speaker 3>uniform structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to take out all those </v>

605
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 3>pieces that are dominated by women say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

606
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:55.144
<v Speaker 3>that's not the patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is is that the whole </v>

607
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 3>concept is so we'll define that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that it guards description,</v>

608
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 3>but so is you howard though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

609
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the claim.</v>

610
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:07.570
<v Speaker 3>The other claim is that all hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 3>are predicated on power,</v>

611
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 3>which is a claim that's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>appalling.</v>

612
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like plumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they part of the higher curry hierarchy.</v>

613
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 3>You've got roaming bands of armed </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

614
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical plumber's coming to your door</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

615
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.630
<v Speaker 3>use our service or else if that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it works.</v>

616
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 3>You go look when you're going looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a plumber,</v>

617
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 3>you go look for a massage therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look or a surgeon for that matter,</v>

618
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:29.703
<v Speaker 3>or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go look for the person who's most </v>

619
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:32.314
<v Speaker 3>competent and one of the things the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't tolerate is the idea that </v>

620
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.340
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies are predicated in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even on competence,</v>

621
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.203
<v Speaker 3>which they clearly are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best predictors for success in </v>

622
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 3>western hierarchies are intelligence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

623
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Those are the best psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>predictors of success.</v>

624
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 3>They only account for about a third of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the variation in success.</v>

625
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.313
<v Speaker 3>maybe a third is probably about right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's still lots of room for </v>

626
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 3>randomness and and even for systemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination,</v>

627
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.210
<v Speaker 3>but the notion that our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our systems aren't predicated in part on</v>

628
00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 3>competence is clearly wrong.</v>

629
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you asked a question about the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

630
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.123
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are the left always on the side of </v>

631
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 3>the people who don't fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

632
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:12.964
<v Speaker 3>or don't fit so easily at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is a matter of the </v>

633
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:16.264
<v Speaker 3>consequences of hierarchical structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that so imagine in every hierarchy </v>

634
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 3>there's some people who don't do very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well in any given hierarchy.</v>

635
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.093
<v Speaker 3>Then imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then imagine across all the hierarchies </v>

636
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 3>that there's this subset of people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very likely to not do well in any of</v>

637
00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>

638
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:33.184
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're systemically discriminated </v>

639
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:35.074
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left would be on their side because </v>

640
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:37.624
<v Speaker 3>they're on the site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even temperamentally of the people who </v>

641
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:40.054
<v Speaker 3>are dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about that is that it's </v>

642
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 3>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

643
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.613
<v Speaker 3>we need a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need a spokesperson politically for </v>

644
00:31:49.271 --> 00:31:52.060
<v Speaker 3>the dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the democratic party used to</v>

645
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:53.920
<v Speaker 3>do when they work for the working class.</v>

646
00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.320
<v Speaker 3>The working class needed to political </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice.</v>

647
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:56.921
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

648
00:31:56.921 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 3>that's the democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

649
00:31:57.911 --> 00:31:59.740
<v Speaker 3>why do they need a political voice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well to,</v>

650
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.693
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep the hierarchy from degenerating </v>

651
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>into rigid tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the political discussion,</v>

652
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.220
<v Speaker 3>but now the problem is is this is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with the left is that,</v>

653
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the hierarchy?</v>

654
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a tyrannical patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

655
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

656
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.653
<v Speaker 3>It's partly corrupt like every system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's less corrupt than most systems </v>

657
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of elements of it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are devoted towards self improvement and</v>

658
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:25.384
<v Speaker 3>self monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be a little nuanced and </v>

659
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:27.844
<v Speaker 3>subtle about these sorts of things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't throw the baby out with the </v>

660
00:32:30.401 --> 00:32:34.270
<v Speaker 3>bathwater and the leftist rhetoric has </v>
<v Speaker 3>got so intense that the.</v>

661
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 3>The idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people believe this,</v>

662
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:37.324
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is going to hell in hand </v>

663
00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:38.714
<v Speaker 3>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is getting worse in all </v>

664
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.334
<v Speaker 3>possible ways and there's systemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>racism everywhere and it's utterly </v>

665
00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 3>unfair and it should be torn down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebuilt.</v>

666
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

667
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.143
<v Speaker 3>it's actually functioning unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>well even though it still has its </v>

668
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

669
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:52.994
<v Speaker 3>and there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying there's systemic racism </v>

670
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.983
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and the reason that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't perfectly equal outcomes is </v>

671
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:01.780
<v Speaker 3>because of prejudice and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

672
00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:02.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

673
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 3>the system is functioning now are let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>say at 75 percent.</v>

674
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.763
<v Speaker 3>It's doing all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got some problems including </v>

675
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:12.740
<v Speaker 3>systemic prejudice which hopefully will </v>
<v Speaker 3>work themselves out across time and,</v>

676
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.873
<v Speaker 3>and which show every bit of evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing so and so we don't need a radical </v>

677
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

678
00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things I've started to do</v>

679
00:33:21.741 --> 00:33:22.574
<v Speaker 3>with my twitter account is to tweet out </v>
<v Speaker 3>good non naive news Because one of the </v>

680
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:28.574
<v Speaker 3>things that's happening in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been half a dozen books on this </v>

681
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.753
<v Speaker 3>or more written in the last five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>by credible people is that the </v>

682
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 3>distribution of the idea of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty and property rights and free</v>

683
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:40.874
<v Speaker 3>market economies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc out into the rest of the world is </v>

684
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 3>making the non westworld is making the </v>
<v Speaker 3>non western world rich really,</v>

685
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>

686
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.773
<v Speaker 3>So between 2000 and 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rate of absolute poverty in the </v>

687
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:57.080
<v Speaker 3>world fell by half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

688
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 3>It was the fastest period of economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>development in human history.</v>

689
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.333
<v Speaker 3>We beat the un,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we beat the optimistic un target by </v>

690
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Staggering.</v>

691
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

692
00:34:07.911 --> 00:34:08.744
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rates of child mortality in africa </v>

693
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 3>are now lower than they were in europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 1950.</v>

694
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 3>The fastest growing economies in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world are in subsaharan africa.</v>

695
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.023
<v Speaker 3>Many millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of people a month are getting </v>

696
00:34:23.401 --> 00:34:27.240
<v Speaker 3>access to this incredible technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's embodied in cell phones,</v>

697
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.633
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have access to fresh water like </v>

698
00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:32.030
<v Speaker 3>they've never had access before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The child,</v>

699
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.083
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids are kids are getting immunized </v>

700
00:34:35.971 --> 00:34:37.470
<v Speaker 3>at a rate that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's unfair,</v>

701
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.020
<v Speaker 3>that's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

702
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.490
<v Speaker 3>and yet we have this idea that's become </v>
<v Speaker 3>rampant in the west,</v>

703
00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:45.324
<v Speaker 3>that there's something ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt about the patriarchal tyranny </v>

704
00:34:48.001 --> 00:34:51.090
<v Speaker 3>and that it has to be dismantled right </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to its core.</v>

705
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.900
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that's being taught by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>activist disciplines in universities.</v>

706
00:34:54.901 --> 00:34:57.300
<v Speaker 3>And I just don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not acceptable.</v>

707
00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.493
<v Speaker 2>So they see these hierarchies and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposal to level everything off and to </v>

708
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:10.140
<v Speaker 2>take away the insane power at the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>top is equality of outcome,</v>

709
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.890
<v Speaker 2>is unproven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unproven in terms of it's never been.</v>

710
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.210
<v Speaker 2>It's never been done successfully to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>utopian right,</v>

711
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:18.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

712
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.073
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also don't even think you can do </v>

713
00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:21.174
<v Speaker 3>it in principle because if you accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>the proposition that the propositions I </v>

714
00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:25.394
<v Speaker 3>laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you have to pursue things of </v>

715
00:35:26.551 --> 00:35:30.330
<v Speaker 3>value and if you pursue things in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>value in,</v>

716
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.583
<v Speaker 3>in a social space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you do it cooperatively and </v>

717
00:35:32.971 --> 00:35:34.560
<v Speaker 3>competitively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it with other people,</v>

718
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:35.723
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>differential outcome because people be </v>

719
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>

720
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

721
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 4>okaY,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't believe that.</v>

722
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:41.603
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

723
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.623
<v Speaker 4>do you listen to random selections of </v>
<v Speaker 4>music online or do you do what everyone </v>

724
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.424
<v Speaker 4>else does?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go for the one 10th of one percent </v>

725
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 4>of songwriters and you only listen to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

726
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.823
<v Speaker 4>You only listen to the one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only read the productions of one </v>

727
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:56.184
<v Speaker 4>10th of one percent of writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only listen to the podcasts of one </v>

728
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 4>10th of one percent of podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Broadcasters,</v>

729
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.103
<v Speaker 4>right when you watch sports on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you only watch the athletic </v>

730
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 4>contributions of one 10th of one percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>of athletes,</v>

731
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.630
<v Speaker 4>so like where's the equality?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

732
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:13.703
<v Speaker 4>Where's that in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You people who are pushing for equality </v>

733
00:36:16.121 --> 00:36:18.710
<v Speaker 4>of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You manifest that in anything you do,</v>

734
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.173
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're unbelievably selective just like </v>

735
00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:25.690
<v Speaker 4>everyone else and the reason you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>selective is because you.</v>

736
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.673
<v Speaker 4>There are things that are happening that</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to happen or that are entertaining </v>

737
00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:33.530
<v Speaker 4>and interesting and you want the best in</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of those realms.</v>

738
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.910
<v Speaker 4>That's how it works and there is a best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing that's so painful</v>

739
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.330
<v Speaker 4>and that that actually is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

740
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.780
<v Speaker 4>Here's a problem of dispossession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A real problem.</v>

741
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.113
<v Speaker 4>One waY to not do very well in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy is to have a low iq and so iq </v>

742
00:36:54.431 --> 00:36:58.330
<v Speaker 4>is normally distributed and if you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>an iq of less than 85,</v>

743
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.390
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for you to read well enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>follow instructions.</v>

744
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:02.973
<v Speaker 4>That's about 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population might even be higher than </v>

745
00:37:04.721 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

746
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:08.790
<v Speaker 4>so given that lack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to compete?</v>

747
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 4>Announcer is you're not because low iq </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a good predictor of poverty.</v>

748
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Now these spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you're,</v>

749
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.060
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're cognitively,</v>

750
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.430
<v Speaker 4>if you're on in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

751
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.990
<v Speaker 4>if you're less cognitively gifted then </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you have children,</v>

752
00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:27.640
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be in a less enriched </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>

753
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.473
<v Speaker 4>These things spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still have the essential </v>

754
00:37:30.161 --> 00:37:30.994
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the essential problem of the </v>

755
00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:32.914
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like hierarchies are complex tools </v>

756
00:37:35.621 --> 00:37:38.770
<v Speaker 4>to obtain necessary goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they dispossessed people.</v>

757
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.170
<v Speaker 4>What do we do with the people that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispossessed?</v>

758
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.093
<v Speaker 4>The answer is we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have to talk about it constantly </v>

759
00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:46.964
<v Speaker 4>to figure out how to solve it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an ongoing problem that transforms </v>

760
00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.174
<v Speaker 4>and that's the reason that political </v>
<v Speaker 4>dialogue is necessary and then the </v>

761
00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Speaker 4>danger is is that the political dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 4>will polarize into the radical left,</v>

762
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.270
<v Speaker 4>no hierarchies whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the radical right?</v>

763
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.890
<v Speaker 4>Our hierarchy is 100 percent right at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all costs and so those are the.</v>

764
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.293
<v Speaker 4>We have the eternal problem and those </v>
<v Speaker 4>are the two poles that we have to </v>

765
00:38:07.011 --> 00:38:07.940
<v Speaker 4>negotIate between.</v>

766
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.503
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because the accusation </v>
<v Speaker 2>has always been that what the left is </v>

767
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:13.854
<v Speaker 2>trying to do with this equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome thing is sort of an infant's </v>

768
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.310
<v Speaker 2>stylization of the populous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

769
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.310
<v Speaker 2>And the best example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sports,</v>

770
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at sports,</v>

771
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 2>clearly the best people when the fastest</v>
<v Speaker 2>runners,</v>

772
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:30.384
<v Speaker 2>when the race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that have the best strategy </v>

773
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 2>when the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant infant,</v>

774
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird</v>

775
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.680
<v Speaker 3>word in fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand and I never get it right,</v>

776
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:43.681
<v Speaker 3>but of that is what we do with children </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you get participation trophies and</v>

777
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 3>no one wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When my daughter was three years old,</v>

778
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 3>she was in soccer and they didn't keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>score,</v>

779
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 3>but everyone knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knew these kids scored and they</v>

780
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:54.340
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the game,</v>

781
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:55.740
<v Speaker 3>they didn't announce a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

782
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a soccer game without </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping score.</v>

783
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 3>You're not a soccer game anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something else.</v>

784
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 3>But the score was kept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

785
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't discussed was of course </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the strangest thing,</v>

786
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 3>but this is to treat these little kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they couldn't handle it.</v>

787
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 3>she cried when the other team scored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

788
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:16.861
<v Speaker 3>that's it feels bad when they score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it feels good when you score.</v>

789
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.240
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to say that to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>three year old.</v>

790
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.660
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to run hills.</v>

791
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.613
<v Speaker 3>Is she going to practice drills so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she feels that good feeling more and </v>

792
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:28.900
<v Speaker 3>then there's a point where that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>too far.</v>

793
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a point where you become an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessive over winter,</v>

794
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.973
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the people that want to </v>

795
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 3>crush their enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you become conan the barbarian.</v>

796
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

797
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:40.060
<v Speaker 3>This is the far end of it and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the left is terrified up,</v>

798
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.953
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

799
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.470
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the left is the demure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the soft,</v>

800
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.290
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

801
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that are kinder and gentler.</v>

802
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the right is the conqueror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that work hard,</v>

803
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 3>play hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go kick ass,</v>

804
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Speaker 3>go America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of shit.</v>

805
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.270
<v Speaker 3>And so these are the type of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to be crueler.</v>

806
00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.253
<v Speaker 3>They're going to do what it takes to win</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people that you would consider </v>

807
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.753
<v Speaker 3>that would like equality of outcome or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that are trying to slow that </v>

808
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:08.134
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

809
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Does this make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

810
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.623
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's how it lays itself </v>

811
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:12.400
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temperamentally,</v>

812
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the motivation for all this.</v>

813
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.103
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

814
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:16.953
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

815
00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 3>And the radical left is his compassion </v>
<v Speaker 3>going mad,</v>

816
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.520
<v Speaker 3>although it's also envy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not forget about that as well.</v>

817
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

818
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:25.653
<v Speaker 3>one reason to stand up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed is because you're </v>

819
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 3>empathetic and empathy is not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>automatic good.</v>

820
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.790
<v Speaker 3>This is something we make a big mistake </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

821
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.653
<v Speaker 3>We think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

822
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling sorry for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore I'm good.</v>

823
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:38.351
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

824
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I might be feeling too sorry for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not be demanding enough of you.</v>

825
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.533
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the terrible devouring </v>

826
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:44.891
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:48.550
<v Speaker 3>from a psychoanalytic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you do dear is okay.</v>

828
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.061
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

829
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:50.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

830
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.460
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that john piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the developmental psychologist,</v>

831
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:55.294
<v Speaker 3>he was very interested in figuring out a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way out of this and it's very much </v>

832
00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.490
<v Speaker 3>relevant to your concept you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about about athletics.</v>

833
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.471
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

834
00:41:01.471 --> 00:41:02.304
<v Speaker 3>so imagine this because this is also </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that points the way to a </v>

835
00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:06.124
<v Speaker 3>proper morality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was actually something that john </v>

836
00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 3>piaget was very concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to.</v>

837
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to reconcile that distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between religion and science.</v>

838
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 3>That's actually what drove him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he was.</v>

839
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.413
<v Speaker 3>people don't know that he was arguably </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's greatest developmental </v>

840
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.900
<v Speaker 3>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

841
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 3>So here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

842
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:24.400
<v Speaker 3>how you tell your kid to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

843
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.503
<v Speaker 3>You say don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter whether you win and </v>

844
00:41:26.401 --> 00:41:27.820
<v Speaker 3>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it matters how you play the game.</v>

845
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.283
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've been unpacking that in my </v>

846
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:32.260
<v Speaker 3>lectures because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really complicated.</v>

847
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like you tell your kid that and</v>

848
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 4>they look at you and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

849
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aren't I supposed to try to win?</v>

850
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a soccer game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to.</v>

851
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you say,</v>

852
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to win,</v>

853
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter whether you win or</v>
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>

854
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 4>It matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that that's right.</v>

855
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 4>But you don't know how to explain it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kit.</v>

856
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:50.991
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

857
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:52.760
<v Speaker 4>you want to be a good sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

858
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:53.594
<v Speaker 4>so imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how it works and this is </v>

859
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:58.190
<v Speaker 4>crucially important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So first of all,</v>

860
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 4>life is not a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even a game is not a game because a game</v>

861
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:08.780
<v Speaker 4>is most of the time the game is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of a series of games.</v>

862
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 4>So let's say that you're on a soccer </v>
<v Speaker 4>team.</v>

863
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 4>Well there's wInning the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the game isn't the issue.</v>

864
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:15.973
<v Speaker 4>the game is the whole series of game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe the game is winning the </v>

865
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 4>championship and winning the </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship and winning ad game are not</v>

866
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is,</v>

867
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 4>well maybe if you want to win a game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best thing to do is to let your star</v>

868
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:30.650
<v Speaker 4>player make all the moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you want to win a championship,</v>

869
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:31.484
<v Speaker 4>maybe the best thing is for your star </v>
<v Speaker 4>player to do everything he or she </v>

870
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 4>possibly can to develop all the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>team members.</v>

871
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.333
<v Speaker 4>That's a different strategy and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason it's different is because it </v>

872
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:41.000
<v Speaker 4>iterates across time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

873
00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:44.210
<v Speaker 4>so I'll tell you a quick story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when my kid was playing hockey,</v>

874
00:42:44.211 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he was about 12 or so,</v>

875
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:48.710
<v Speaker 4>he was in the championship game just at </v>
<v Speaker 4>a local arena,</v>

876
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:49.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

877
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.500
<v Speaker 4>it was really fun to watch.</v>

878
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 4>The teams were pretty equal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that you want so that</v>

879
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:55.634
<v Speaker 4>everybody can expand their skills while </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're playing and it was like five </v>

880
00:43:00.081 --> 00:43:00.914
<v Speaker 4>seconds to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the end of the game and the other </v>

881
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:03.284
<v Speaker 4>team made a breakaway and came down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy came down nice and scored a </v>

882
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.120
<v Speaker 4>beautiful goal and it was for three and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the end of it,</v>

883
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.983
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all my kids team there is the kid </v>

884
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 4>who is the star and he was a pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 4>hockey player.</v>

885
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 4>He came off the ice and he was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoyed about wHat had happened.</v>

886
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 4>He smashed his stick on the cement and </v>
<v Speaker 4>was complaining about the refereeing and</v>

887
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:21.643
<v Speaker 4>acting as if he'd been robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his father came up and instead of </v>

888
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:25.850
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your act together,</v>

889
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:26.684
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's no way to display yourself after </v>

890
00:43:28.071 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 4>a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

891
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were robbed that the referees didn't</v>

892
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:32.400
<v Speaker 4>ref right.</v>

893
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 4>And you played the best and you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>have one,</v>

894
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 4>and I thought you had absolute son of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

895
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.660
<v Speaker 4>You're ruining your son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the question is why?</v>

896
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 4>Because hIs son was the star and was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to win.</v>

897
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 4>Why was he running his son?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

898
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to train your son not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>win the game.</v>

899
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to train your son to win </v>
<v Speaker 4>the championship.</v>

900
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a series of games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then life isn't the championship.</v>

901
00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 4>Life is a whole bunch of championships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a whole sequence of them.</v>

902
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.073
<v Speaker 4>And so what you're actually trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>train your son to do is to be a </v>

903
00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:06.404
<v Speaker 4>contender in the entire series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way you do that is by helping </v>

904
00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:11.054
<v Speaker 4>him develop his character and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>character is actually the strategy that </v>

905
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:15.224
<v Speaker 4>would enable him to win the largest </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of games across the largest </v>

906
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.760
<v Speaker 4>possible span of time.</v>

907
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.160
<v Speaker 4>And one way you do That if you're a kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

908
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:23.510
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want to do with your kid?</v>

909
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.913
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to teach him to when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to teach him to play well with </v>

910
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:29.750
<v Speaker 4>others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's to be reciprocal.</v>

911
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.810
<v Speaker 4>So that means to try to win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also to pay attention to the,</v>

912
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.713
<v Speaker 4>to to developing the other people around</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and not to put winning the game </v>

913
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:38.364
<v Speaker 4>above everything at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Then he's fun to play with and this </v>

914
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 4>is absolutely crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get you can.</v>

915
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 4>You can help your kid become fun to play</v>
<v Speaker 4>with between the ages of two and the age</v>

916
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 4>of four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If your kid is fun to play with,</v>

917
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 4>then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids line up to play with him and adults</v>

918
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:58.520
<v Speaker 4>lined up to teach him and if kids line </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to play with him,</v>

919
00:44:58.610 --> 00:44:59.443
<v Speaker 4>then he'll have friends his whole life </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he'll be socialized and can be </v>

920
00:45:01.401 --> 00:45:03.530
<v Speaker 4>invited to many games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of which he'll win.</v>

921
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.630
<v Speaker 4>All of which will be able to participate</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

922
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:08.360
<v Speaker 4>And if he's fun to play within,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adults will teach him things.</v>

923
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.630
<v Speaker 4>and then he wins at life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you say to your kid,</v>

924
00:45:11.631 --> 00:45:14.510
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose matters how you play the game.</v>

925
00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:18.320
<v Speaker 4>What you're saying is don't forget kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what you're trying to do here is to</v>

926
00:45:18.321 --> 00:45:19.154
<v Speaker 4>do well at life and you need to practice</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strategies that enable you to do </v>

927
00:45:23.151 --> 00:45:23.984
<v Speaker 4>well at life while you're in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific game and you never want to </v>

928
00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:27.794
<v Speaker 4>compromise your ability to do well at </v>
<v Speaker 4>life for the sake of winning a single </v>

929
00:45:30.771 --> 00:45:31.604
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a deep ethic in that and </v>

930
00:45:33.071 --> 00:45:33.904
<v Speaker 4>it's the ethic of reciprocity in games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of the reason that we're so </v>

931
00:45:38.091 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with sports is because we like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see that dramatized.</v>

932
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:43.164
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the person we really admire as an </v>

933
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 4>athlete isn't only the person who wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't like the narcissistic winners.</v>

934
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:51.540
<v Speaker 4>They're winners and that's a plus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they're narcissistic,</v>

935
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.493
<v Speaker 4>they're not good team players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're only out for themselves than we </v>

936
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:56.064
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

937
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 4>you're a winner in the narrow sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your character is suspect.</v>

938
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.620
<v Speaker 4>You're no role model even though you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>a winner,</v>

939
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 4>and it's because we're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>something deeper.</v>

940
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.393
<v Speaker 4>We're looking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The manifestation of character that </v>

941
00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 4>allows you to win across the set of </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible games,</v>

942
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 4>and that's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real ethic.</v>

943
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.250
<v Speaker 4>It's a fundamental ethic.</v>

944
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're pointing out that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very important is we're,</v>

945
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 2>we're searching for the person who's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all nailed.</v>

946
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.263
<v Speaker 2>Someone who tries their hardest but is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also honest enough about the </v>

947
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.731
<v Speaker 2>circumstances to not cry foul when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone the other person's way yet.</v>

948
00:46:32.421 --> 00:46:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of resIlience.</v>

949
00:46:33.641 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna win it.</v>

950
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to score on every shot.</v>

951
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.143
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean you shouldn't take the </v>

952
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:41.940
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean you shouldn't try to to hit</v>

953
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:42.774
<v Speaker 2>the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of part of being able to </v>

954
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:45.414
<v Speaker 2>continue to take shots is to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength of character to tolerate the </v>

955
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 2>fact that that in that instance you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't on top.</v>

956
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.033
<v Speaker 2>It's more trivial in games than it is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and it's also the response is </v>

957
00:46:58.551 --> 00:47:03.551
<v Speaker 2>much more negative to the from the fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you lose a fight and complained about</v>

958
00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.180
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

959
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 2>It's ruthless because they understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've made a huge character error.</v>

960
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do you think it's more important </v>

961
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.843
<v Speaker 2>in fights than it is in games?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think it's because the </v>

962
00:47:15.801 --> 00:47:16.634
<v Speaker 2>consequences are so grave?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you recognize that the high is </v>

963
00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:21.950
<v Speaker 2>much higher and the lows are much lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose.</v>

964
00:47:21.951 --> 00:47:24.950
<v Speaker 2>A basketball game sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's nothing like losing a fight.</v>

965
00:47:24.951 --> 00:47:26.810
<v Speaker 2>There's no comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even close.</v>

966
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.600
<v Speaker 2>What do you think</v>

967
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 4>it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The damages the fighter.</v>

968
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 4>If he complains about losing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that a mistake?</v>

969
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 4>Why did the fans respond negatively to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

970
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Because they know they know that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost.</v>

971
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 4>They know that you're complaining for no</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason and you're not a hero.</v>

972
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:43.563
<v Speaker 4>They want you to be better than them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want you to be the person that has </v>

973
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.470
<v Speaker 4>the courage to step into a cage or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ring or wherever,</v>

974
00:47:48.471 --> 00:47:49.304
<v Speaker 4>wherever you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the format is you're competing </v>

975
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.100
<v Speaker 4>and to do something that's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult and when you do that,</v>

976
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:56.560
<v Speaker 4>they hold you to a higher standard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lose with grace.</v>

977
00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you fall,</v>

978
00:47:57.611 --> 00:47:58.444
<v Speaker 4>especially if you were a champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is one of the most disappointing </v>

979
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:03.990
<v Speaker 4>things ever want to champion complains </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it.</v>

980
00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.700
<v Speaker 4>His response is horrific from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>

981
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a great example.</v>

982
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 4>So let's imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does the person who loses something</v>

983
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 4>important with grace?</v>

984
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Do announcers fairlY straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He accepts the defeat and thinks,</v>

985
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

986
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.983
<v Speaker 4>What is it that I have left to improve </v>
<v Speaker 4>that will decrease the possibility of a </v>

987
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:24.850
<v Speaker 4>similar defeat in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

988
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.693
<v Speaker 4>so so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what he's doing is because the great </v>

989
00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:28.864
<v Speaker 4>athlete and the great person is not only</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's exceptionally skilled at </v>

990
00:48:32.381 --> 00:48:33.214
<v Speaker 4>what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who's trying to expand their skills </v>

991
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:36.270
<v Speaker 4>at all at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

992
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.660
<v Speaker 4>and the attempt to expand their skills </v>
<v Speaker 4>at all times is even more important than</v>

993
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:41.494
<v Speaker 4>the fact that they're great to begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>with because the trajectory is so </v>

994
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:44.014
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more important in particular to the </v>

995
00:48:45.671 --> 00:48:48.040
<v Speaker 4>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely important to the audience</v>

996
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 4>because you are the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>competing.</v>

997
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.333
<v Speaker 4>You are expecting them to live out this </v>
<v Speaker 4>life in a perfect way or in a much more </v>

998
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:58.510
<v Speaker 4>powerful way than you're capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so part of that is the skill because</v>

999
00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 4>they put it into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but part of that also is the willingness</v>

1000
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:05.530
<v Speaker 4>to push the skill farther into new </v>
<v Speaker 4>domains of development with each action,</v>

1001
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 4>and that's really what people like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch,</v>

1002
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1003
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 4>They don't like to watch a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic performance.</v>

1004
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:11.463
<v Speaker 4>They like to watch a perfect athletic </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance that's pushed into the </v>

1005
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:17.020
<v Speaker 4>domain of new risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to see both at the same time.</v>

1006
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.240
<v Speaker 4>You're really good at what you do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting better.</v>

1007
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.343
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you lose a match which is not any </v>

1008
00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:23.860
<v Speaker 4>indication that you're not good at what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

1009
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.900
<v Speaker 4>You might not be as good as the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who beat you,</v>

1010
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.033
<v Speaker 4>but if you lose the match and then wine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you've done is sacrificed the </v>

1011
00:49:29.911 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 4>higher order principle of constant </v>
<v Speaker 4>improvement,</v>

1012
00:49:32.081 --> 00:49:35.530
<v Speaker 4>of your own skills because you should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzing the loss and saying,</v>

1013
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.603
<v Speaker 4>I'm the reason I lost in so far as it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>relevant to this particular time and </v>

1014
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:42.064
<v Speaker 4>place is the insufficiencies I </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifested that defeated me and I need </v>

1015
00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:48.490
<v Speaker 4>to track those insufficiency so that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can rectify them in the future.</v>

1016
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.593
<v Speaker 4>And if I'm blaming it on you or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>referees or the situation that I'm not </v>

1017
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 4>taking responsibility and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing myself forward.</v>

1018
00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 4>And so then you also take the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of it.</v>

1019
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things I've been doing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>my tour,</v>

1020
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.653
<v Speaker 4>people are criticizing me to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 4>for saying things to people that are </v>

1021
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:05.590
<v Speaker 4>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1022
00:50:05.591 --> 00:50:07.390
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I didn't bloody well no,</v>

1023
00:50:07.391 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 4>they were obvious when I wrote those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1024
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 4>You want my rules in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1025
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 4>stand up straight with your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1026
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:14.824
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>treat yourself like you're someone </v>

1027
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:16.354
<v Speaker 4>responsible for helping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I know perfectly well that </v>

1028
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Speaker 4>those can be read as cliches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is cliche,</v>

1029
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 4>let's say is something that's so true </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's that it's become</v>

1030
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 5>that it's become widely accepted by </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone.</v>

1031
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we don't know why it's true anymore.</v>

1032
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.080
<v Speaker 5>And so this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this issue,</v>

1033
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 5>the issue that we're talking about here </v>
<v Speaker 5>are the issue of being a good sport.</v>

1034
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:40.184
<v Speaker 5>We need to figure out why that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason that it's true is that </v>

1035
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.640
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to push your development </v>
<v Speaker 5>farther than you've already developed at</v>

1036
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 5>every point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the proper.</v>

1037
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 5>That's the proper moral attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1038
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:57.503
<v Speaker 5>when you see an athletic performance </v>
<v Speaker 5>where someone is pushing themselves </v>

1039
00:50:59.881 --> 00:51:00.714
<v Speaker 5>beyond what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see someone dramatizing the process </v>

1040
00:51:03.031 --> 00:51:05.700
<v Speaker 5>of proper adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It isn't the skill itself,</v>

1041
00:51:05.701 --> 00:51:06.534
<v Speaker 5>it's the extension of the skill and when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see someone acting like a bad sport </v>

1042
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:10.064
<v Speaker 5>and they're sacrificing that and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're sacrificing the higher for the </v>

1043
00:51:12.211 --> 00:51:14.670
<v Speaker 5>lower and no one likes that in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights.</v>

1044
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.580
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See the question is,</v>

1045
00:51:17.581 --> 00:51:18.414
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing I can't quite figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out is why that would be even </v>

1046
00:51:19.981 --> 00:51:20.814
<v Speaker 5>exaggerated in a fight situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you said it's because the </v>

1047
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:24.360
<v Speaker 5>stakes are so high.</v>

1048
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:25.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consequences of victory or defeat </v>

1049
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.190
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just so much greater.</v>

1050
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.250
<v Speaker 2>There's your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your health is on the lot.</v>

1051
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.960
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the rare things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>where your health is on the line,</v>

1052
00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:37.890
<v Speaker 2>your physical health,</v>

1053
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.863
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the more extreme victories and more </v>

1054
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:40.964
<v Speaker 5>extreme defeats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the morality that's associated with </v>

1055
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 5>defeat is more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1056
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Because there's more on the line.</v>

1057
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:46.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1058
00:51:46.141 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way people treat the champions,</v>

1059
00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.213
<v Speaker 2>it's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the respect and adulation that a </v>

1060
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:56.264
<v Speaker 2>champion receives is it's the pinnacle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sports in terms of the love from the </v>

1061
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone wins a great fight,</v>

1062
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.253
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like it and this is one </v>

1063
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:08.174
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to put their health on the line </v>

1064
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 2>because that high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high of victory,</v>

1065
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

1066
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Who was it who said victory is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>the victory over the lesser you.</v>

1067
00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a victory over as the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1068
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the victory is over you.</v>

1069
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.653
<v Speaker 2>You've got to realize a guy like steve </v>
<v Speaker 2>bay chick who defends his heavyweight </v>

1070
00:52:33.211 --> 00:52:36.730
<v Speaker 2>title this weekend in the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

1071
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:38.870
<v Speaker 2>he's the heavYweight champion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1072
00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but he's not undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lost in his career.</v>

1073
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>He's lost a couple of times and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's lost wrestling matches and</v>

1074
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 2>sparring sessions in the gym and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of improvement.</v>

1075
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.453
<v Speaker 2>He's a product of discipline and hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and thinking and strategy and </v>

1076
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:59.840
<v Speaker 2>constantly improving upon those skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because of that,</v>

1077
00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:00.674
<v Speaker 2>he's the baddest man.</v>

1078
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:03.000
<v Speaker 5>So my in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rule four is,</v>

1079
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.460
<v Speaker 5>this is 12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

1080
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.010
<v Speaker 5>this is from 12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rule four is compare yourself to who you</v>

1081
00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:13.290
<v Speaker 5>were yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to who someone else's today.</v>

1082
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you need to be.</v>

1083
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.550
<v Speaker 5>You need to have a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 5>improvement.</v>

1084
00:53:17.551 --> 00:53:18.384
<v Speaker 5>You need to be aiming for something and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that means you're going to be lesser </v>

1085
00:53:20.701 --> 00:53:21.534
<v Speaker 5>than people who've always already </v>
<v Speaker 5>attained along that dimension and that </v>

1086
00:53:24.121 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 5>can give rise to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1087
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 4>the question is who should you defeat in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the final analysis?</v>

1088
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is you should defeat your</v>
<v Speaker 4>former self.</v>

1089
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.003
<v Speaker 4>You should be constantly trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and you're the right control for </v>

1090
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.244
<v Speaker 4>yourself too because you're the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's had all your advantages and </v>

1091
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:38.274
<v Speaker 4>disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you want to compete fairly </v>

1092
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 4>with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you should be competing with you.</v>

1093
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.193
<v Speaker 4>And it is the case in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what we were talking about too </v>

1094
00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:46.644
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the self improvement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fighter is well if you're improving </v>

1095
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:51.114
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then what you are doing is competing </v>

1096
00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 4>with your lesser self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you might also ask,</v>

1097
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:55.404
<v Speaker 4>well what is that lesser self?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that lesser self would be resentful </v>

1098
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:03.591
<v Speaker 4>and bitter and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm aggressive and vengeance seeking</v>

1099
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:07.320
<v Speaker 4>and all of those things that go along </v>
<v Speaker 4>with having a negative moral character.</v>

1100
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:08.154
<v Speaker 4>And those are things that interfere with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to progress as you move </v>

1101
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:11.640
<v Speaker 4>forward through life.</v>

1102
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 4>So it's very necessary to understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this is why,</v>

1103
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been stressing this idea of </v>

1104
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:19.134
<v Speaker 4>personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Personal responsibility is to compete </v>

1105
00:54:22.021 --> 00:54:22.854
<v Speaker 4>with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to be slightly better than yourself </v>

1106
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 4>the next day and it better in some way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can actually manage.</v>

1107
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And that's humility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right,</v>

1108
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:29.431
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1109
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm a flawed person and I've got all my </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

1110
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:36.330
<v Speaker 4>Could I be as good as person x?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like not right question.</v>

1111
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:37.164
<v Speaker 4>The right question is could You be </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly better tomorrow than you are </v>

1112
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:39.984
<v Speaker 4>currently flawed self?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now answer to that is if you have </v>

1113
00:54:42.571 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 4>enough humility to set the bar properly </v>
<v Speaker 4>low,</v>

1114
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 4>then you could be better tomorrow than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are today.</v>

1115
00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Because what you also have to do is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to say,</v>

1116
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:51.954
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's all my flaws and my </v>

1117
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:55.014
<v Speaker 4>insufficiencies and the best that </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that flawed and insufficient </v>

1118
00:54:58.231 --> 00:55:00.990
<v Speaker 4>could do to improve and actually do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is this,</v>

1119
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:01.973
<v Speaker 4>and that's not worth going out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street and celebrating with plaque </v>

1120
00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:04.620
<v Speaker 4>cards.</v>

1121
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1122
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:06.443
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I tell people to clean the </v>

1123
00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:07.824
<v Speaker 4>room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to brag to someone that </v>

1124
00:55:08.791 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 4>you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but someone is insufficient as you might</v>

1125
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:12.324
<v Speaker 4>be able to manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that means you actually are on the </v>

1126
00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:14.994
<v Speaker 4>pathway to self improvement and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcending your former self and you </v>

1127
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:18.151
<v Speaker 4>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1128
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 4>what's the right way of being in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world if there is such a thing?</v>

1129
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's not acting according to a set </v>
<v Speaker 4>of rules.</v>

1130
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.770
<v Speaker 4>It's attempting continually to transcend</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flawed thing that you currently are.</v>

1131
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 4>And what's so interesting about that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the meaning and the meaning in life</v>

1132
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:33.503
<v Speaker 4>is to be found in that pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've been laying that out in these </v>

1133
00:55:35.911 --> 00:55:37.680
<v Speaker 4>discussions too because it's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1134
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:38.963
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fundamental issue is that life is </v>

1135
00:55:40.261 --> 00:55:41.094
<v Speaker 4>tragic and difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very tragic and difficult for everyone </v>

1136
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.593
<v Speaker 4>and it's also tainted by malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 4>because no matter how things are tragic </v>

1137
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:51.714
<v Speaker 4>and difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's always some stupid thing </v>

1138
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:55.620
<v Speaker 4>that you could do or someone else could </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that could make it even worse than it</v>

1139
00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:56.454
<v Speaker 4>has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's life and you need an antidote </v>

1140
00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:02.700
<v Speaker 4>to that because that can embitter you </v>
<v Speaker 4>constant contact with that,</v>

1141
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:03.534
<v Speaker 4>just the tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the tragedy combined with betrayal </v>

1142
00:56:05.881 --> 00:56:08.490
<v Speaker 4>and malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes it even worse,</v>

1143
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's self induced.</v>

1144
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.023
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you need something to set against </v>

1145
00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:14.730
<v Speaker 4>that so you don't get bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful.</v>

1146
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you set against that?</v>

1147
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Doing something worthwhile by her own </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition.</v>

1148
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:20.574
<v Speaker 4>Say you need some reason to get the hell</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of bed on a terrible day because </v>

1149
00:56:23.141 --> 00:56:24.860
<v Speaker 4>you've got something good to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1150
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:25.703
<v Speaker 4>what's the best thing you can do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transcend your current wretched and </v>

1151
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:29.674
<v Speaker 4>miserable self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's meaning to be found in that and </v>

1152
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:32.464
<v Speaker 4>real risk and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a meaning that's associated with </v>

1153
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:35.434
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I've been trying </v>

1154
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 4>to lay out clearly is that life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tainted by malevolence and be trail</v>

1155
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.120
<v Speaker 4>that can make you bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a meaning to offset that.</v>

1156
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.470
<v Speaker 4>where's the meaning to be found?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not in rights,</v>

1157
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.850
<v Speaker 4>not an impulsive pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in responsibility.</v>

1158
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 4>You take responsibility for yourself so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you take care of yourself.</v>

1159
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.313
<v Speaker 4>If you're good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can have some excess leftover to </v>

1160
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:00.850
<v Speaker 4>take care of your damn family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're good at both of those,</v>

1161
00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 4>then you have some excess leftover to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take care of your community.</v>

1162
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.593
<v Speaker 4>Those are heavy burdens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pick up the burdens you find that's </v>

1163
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 4>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best way to pick up the burden is to</v>

1164
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:12.310
<v Speaker 4>continually improve yourself and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the meaning is to be found,</v>

1165
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.460
<v Speaker 4>and so that meaning is in the continual </v>
<v Speaker 4>self transcendence.</v>

1166
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.180
<v Speaker 4>That's letting your old self die and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>new self be reborn.</v>

1167
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.490
<v Speaker 4>You did you watch when we were kings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allie,</v>

1168
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 4>allie fraiser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1169
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.750
<v Speaker 4>that's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing,</v>

1170
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:26.584
<v Speaker 4>amazing movie right at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So lee defeats frazier basically by </v>

1171
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:31.330
<v Speaker 4>letting him defeat himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1172
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:32.164
<v Speaker 4>Because frazier is angry and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chip on his shoulder and he doesn't </v>

1173
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:37.720
<v Speaker 4>conduct the fight properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we exhausts himself chasing ellie and</v>

1174
00:57:37.721 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 4>ellie is basically just trained himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take the dam blows.</v>

1175
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to where frazier out,</v>

1176
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:44.380
<v Speaker 4>that's his plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>then right at the end of the movie,</v>

1177
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:47.650
<v Speaker 4>he knocks frazier down and it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>much the end of the fight,</v>

1178
00:57:47.651 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 4>but frazier sort of struggled to his </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet,</v>

1179
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:50.524
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just getting up off the mat and </v>

1180
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:52.414
<v Speaker 4>alli's got his hand pulled back to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>nail them because he's completely laid </v>

1181
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:58.060
<v Speaker 4>open and he puts his glove down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>turns away.</v>

1182
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 4>That's the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And frazier said,</v>

1183
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 4>and this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I know,</v>

1184
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:03.844
<v Speaker 4>that that fight tamed him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like frazier had a big chip on his </v>

1185
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 4>shoulder and he was kind of a dreadful </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy up until that fight it afterwards.</v>

1186
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 4>He was affable and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was civilized,</v>

1187
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.760
<v Speaker 4>lee civilized and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

1188
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:15.623
<v Speaker 4>that gesture that allie made was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>great gesture because he could have </v>

1189
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 4>flattened him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1190
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.850
<v Speaker 4>And he had every reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1191
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:22.684
<v Speaker 4>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got,</v>

1192
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:24.070
<v Speaker 4>he got taken apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lead,</v>

1193
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:24.904
<v Speaker 4>took punches like mad in that fight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then in the final analysis when he had </v>

1194
00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 4>frazier down and he was struggling to </v>
<v Speaker 4>his feet,</v>

1195
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 4>he just let him go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1196
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Nobility of character right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something impressive to behold.</v>

1197
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.693
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1198
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:39.703
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you defining people like when </v>

1199
00:58:42.741 --> 00:58:45.140
<v Speaker 2>you're saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you saying you're miserable?</v>

1200
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.003
<v Speaker 2>Wretched life because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that don't have miserable </v>

1201
00:58:48.471 --> 00:58:50.510
<v Speaker 2>wretched lives that also just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve.</v>

1202
00:58:50.511 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Like why does it have to be the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>case scenario in order to.</v>

1203
00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.370
<v Speaker 2>cause it has to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to,</v>

1204
00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.070
<v Speaker 2>it has to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The theory has to work in the worst case</v>

1205
00:58:58.071 --> 00:58:58.980
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1206
00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're using the worst case </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario as an.</v>

1207
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.613
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because do you think that that perhaps </v>

1208
00:59:03.621 --> 00:59:04.454
<v Speaker 2>may alienate someone who doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst case scenario just watched </v>

1209
00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:07.730
<v Speaker 2>improvement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1210
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:08.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on how much time you </v>

1211
00:59:10.731 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 2>have outline the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I.</v>

1212
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Because even if things are going really </v>
<v Speaker 2>well for you now,</v>

1213
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:18.970
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be a time in the future</v>
<v Speaker 4>where things are rough,</v>

1214
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be ill,</v>

1215
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 4>family members going to be</v>

1216
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 5>ill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dream is going to fall apart,</v>

1217
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be a,</v>

1218
00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:28.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncertain about your employment status,</v>

1219
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:30.190
<v Speaker 5>like the flood is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1220
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.033
<v Speaker 5>The apocalypse is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always the case in life and you </v>

1221
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:33.974
<v Speaker 5>have to be prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And The question is how to prepare for </v>

1222
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:36.674
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is to find a way </v>

1223
00:59:38.151 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 5>of being that works even under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>diarist of circumstances.</v>

1224
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 5>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you outline,</v>

1225
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.813
<v Speaker 5>and I mean I am pessimistic about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>in my approach in some sense because </v>

1226
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:49.880
<v Speaker 5>when I'm talking to my audiences in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same thing happens in,</v>

1227
00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:52.580
<v Speaker 5>happened in my book maps of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in 12 rules for life,</v>

1228
00:59:52.581 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm laying out the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that sort of like hell,</v>

1229
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.163
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things are going really badly for you </v>

1230
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.490
<v Speaker 5>and that there's just chance associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that sometimes.</v>

1231
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 5>And you and the people around you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing stupid things to make it worse.</v>

1232
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1233
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.820
<v Speaker 5>what have you got under those </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstances?</v>

1234
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 5>You've got the possibility to slowly </v>
<v Speaker 5>raise yourself out of the mire.</v>

1235
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:12.703
<v Speaker 5>You've got the possibility to do just </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fighter does when he's </v>

1236
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:16.070
<v Speaker 5>defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is to say,</v>

1237
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.353
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless of the circumstances that </v>

1238
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:20.594
<v Speaker 5>might have led to my defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even if there were errors on the </v>

1239
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 5>part of the referee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is no time to whine about it.</v>

1240
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.313
<v Speaker 5>This is a time to take stock of what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>did wrong so that I could improve it </v>

1241
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 5>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the right attitude.</v>

1242
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the old testament,</v>

1243
01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:34.664
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting about the old testament </v>

1244
01:00:36.141 --> 01:00:39.890
<v Speaker 5>stories is in the old testament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the jews keep getting walloped by god.</v>

1245
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.813
<v Speaker 5>It's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they struggle up and make an empire and </v>

1246
01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:46.180
<v Speaker 5>then they just get walloped and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all crushed in there.</v>

1247
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.273
<v Speaker 5>They're out of it for generations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they struggle back up and make </v>

1248
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:52.400
<v Speaker 5>an empire and then they get demolished </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

1249
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:55.120
<v Speaker 5>And it happens over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

1250
01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 5>the attitude of the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 5>hebrews is we must have made a mistake.</v>

1251
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 5>It's never to shake their fist at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sky and curse fate.</v>

1252
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.863
<v Speaker 5>it's never that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The presupposition is if things aren't </v>

1253
01:01:07.941 --> 01:01:08.774
<v Speaker 5>working out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's my fault and that's a hell of a </v>

1254
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.760
<v Speaker 5>presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you mighT say,</v>

1255
01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:14.760
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course you know,</v>

1256
01:01:14.761 --> 01:01:15.594
<v Speaker 5>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that underestimates the degree to which </v>

1257
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.740
<v Speaker 5>there is systemic oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>

1258
01:01:20.741 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and and the and the vagaries of fate.</v>

1259
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:25.760
<v Speaker 5>It's like it doesn't over underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the point.</v>

1260
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.193
<v Speaker 5>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your best strategic position is how my </v>

1261
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 5>insufficient and how can I rectify that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you've got.</v>

1262
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is you are insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you could rectify it.</v>

1263
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 5>Both of those are within your grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you aim low enough,</v>

1264
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 5>one of the things you see the you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's another thing you keep saying,</v>

1265
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 5>aim low enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a low enough bar.</v>

1266
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 5>Why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you mean that?</v>

1267
01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.273
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say you've got a kid and you want </v>

1268
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:50.864
<v Speaker 5>the kid to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't set them a bar that's so high </v>

1269
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 5>that it's impossible for them to attain </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1270
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.270
<v Speaker 5>You take a look at the kid and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>

1271
01:01:56.271 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid's got this range of skill,</v>

1272
01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.413
<v Speaker 5>here's a challenge we can throw at him </v>
<v Speaker 5>or her that exceeds their current level </v>

1273
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:03.824
<v Speaker 5>of skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but gives them a reasonable probability </v>

1274
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:06.494
<v Speaker 5>of success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so like I'm saying it tongue and </v>

1275
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:09.710
<v Speaker 5>cheek to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1276
01:02:09.711 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you're,</v>

1277
01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.430
<v Speaker 5>but I'm doing it as an aid to humility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1278
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Speaker 5>well I don't know how to start improving</v>
<v Speaker 5>my life.</v>

1279
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 5>someone might say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say,</v>

1280
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not aiming low enough.</v>

1281
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 4>There's something you could do that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are regarding as trivial that,</v>

1282
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:27.060
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you could do that you would do that</v>

1283
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:27.894
<v Speaker 4>would result in an actual improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a big enough improvement </v>

1284
01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:31.854
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you won'T lower yourself enough to </v>

1285
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 4>take the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incremental steps.</v>

1286
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.233
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is also what is achieved </v>

1287
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:39.780
<v Speaker 4>through exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the most important.</v>

1288
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what do you do when you go and lift</v>

1289
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:42.660
<v Speaker 4>weights?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't go on,</v>

1290
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 4>like if you have a bench press before </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar</v>

1291
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 4>and dropped and dropped the bar through </v>
<v Speaker 4>your skull.</v>

1292
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:49.763
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

1293
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started working out,</v>

1294
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1295
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Speaker 4>I was weighed about 130 pounds and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>six foot one.</v>

1296
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 4>It was a thin kid and I smoked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't in good shape.</v>

1297
01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.533
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't in good physical shape and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to the gym and it was bloody </v>

1298
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 4>embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1299
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.810
<v Speaker 4>when people would come over and help me </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the goddamn weights,</v>

1300
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.880
<v Speaker 4>here's how you're supposed to use this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1301
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.783
<v Speaker 4>it was humiliating and maybe I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressing 65 pounds or something at that </v>

1302
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1303
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:13.404
<v Speaker 4>but what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to lift up 150 pounds and </v>

1304
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 4>injure myself right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1305
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:18.474
<v Speaker 4>I had to go in there and strip down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>put my skinny goddamn self in front of </v>

1306
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:22.134
<v Speaker 4>the mirror and think son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all these monsters in the gym </v>

1307
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:25.643
<v Speaker 4>who'd been lifting weights for 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off </v>

1308
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:30.180
<v Speaker 4>the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tough luck for me,</v>

1309
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:31.283
<v Speaker 4>but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>very long until I could lift 75 and </v>

1310
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1311
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 4>how it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1312
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.633
<v Speaker 4>and I never injured myself when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>weightlifting and the reason for that </v>

1313
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:41.454
<v Speaker 4>was I never pushed myself past where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew I could go and I pushed myself a </v>

1314
01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:46.020
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>

1315
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.853
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about </v>

1316
01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:49.044
<v Speaker 4>three years in university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of had to quit because I was </v>

1317
01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:53.010
<v Speaker 4>eating so god damn much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't stand it.</v>

1318
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 4>SeeMing like six meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just taken up too much time.</v>

1319
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:57.743
<v Speaker 4>but there's a humility in determining </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is that the wretched creature </v>

1320
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 4>that you are can actually manage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aim low.</v>

1321
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.900
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean don't aim and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean don't aim up,</v>

1322
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:08.603
<v Speaker 4>but you have to accept the fact that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can set yourself a goal that you can </v>

1323
01:04:12.601 --> 01:04:13.434
<v Speaker 4>attain and there's not going to be much </v>
<v Speaker 4>glory and to begin with because if </v>

1324
01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:18.570
<v Speaker 4>you're not in very good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal that you could,</v>

1325
01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 4>they could attain tomorrow isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 4>glorious,</v>

1326
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.823
<v Speaker 4>but it's a hell of a lot better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing and it beats the hell out of </v>

1327
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 4>bitterness and it's way better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>blaming someone else.</v>

1328
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 4>It's way less dangerous and you could do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1329
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.313
<v Speaker 4>And what's cool about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a statement in the new </v>

1330
01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:36.750
<v Speaker 4>testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the matthew principle,</v>

1331
01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:37.584
<v Speaker 4>and economists use it to describe how </v>
<v Speaker 4>the economy in the world works to those </v>

1332
01:04:40.471 --> 01:04:42.960
<v Speaker 4>who have everything more will be given </v>
<v Speaker 4>from those who have nothing.</v>

1333
01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:43.794
<v Speaker 4>Everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what's very pessimistic in some </v>

1334
01:04:46.141 --> 01:04:46.974
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it means that as you start to </v>

1335
01:04:47.881 --> 01:04:49.680
<v Speaker 4>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fail more and more rapidly.</v>

1336
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.470
<v Speaker 4>But it also means that as you start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>succeed,</v>

1337
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:56.960
<v Speaker 4>you succeed more and more rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you take an incremental step in,</v>

1338
01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 4>well now you can lift 55 pounds instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>of 52 point five pounds.</v>

1339
01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.060
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well what the hell is that?</v>

1340
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's one step on a very long </v>
<v Speaker 4>journey and so it's.</v>

1341
01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.373
<v Speaker 4>And it starts to compound on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a small step today means puts you in </v>

1342
01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:14.430
<v Speaker 4>a position to take a slightly bigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>step the next day.</v>

1343
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.263
<v Speaker 4>And then that puts you in a position to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take a slightly bigger step the next </v>

1344
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.390
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you do that for two or three years,</v>

1345
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're starting to stride.</v>

1346
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:22.023
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I have so many people coming up to </v>

1347
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:23.764
<v Speaker 4>me now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the things that's so </v>

1348
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:27.400
<v Speaker 4>insanely fun about this tour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is so positive.</v>

1349
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it brings me to tears regularly.</v>

1350
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.233
<v Speaker 4>It's mind boggling because people come </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to me and this is happening wherever </v>

1351
01:05:34.371 --> 01:05:35.204
<v Speaker 4>I go now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say they're very polite when </v>

1352
01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.020
<v Speaker 4>they come and talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1353
01:05:39.021 --> 01:05:40.700
<v Speaker 4>and they're always apologetic for </v>
<v Speaker 4>interrupting.</v>

1354
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:41.563
<v Speaker 4>And so it's never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never narcissistic and it's never </v>

1355
01:05:44.301 --> 01:05:45.134
<v Speaker 4>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy to see people and they </v>

1356
01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:47.810
<v Speaker 4>come up to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1357
01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I know you've heard this lots of times </v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

1358
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.863
<v Speaker 4>but I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've really been putting my life </v>

1359
01:05:52.611 --> 01:05:54.290
<v Speaker 4>together since I've been watching your </v>
<v Speaker 4>lectures.</v>

1360
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.770
<v Speaker 4>then they tell me a story about where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were in some dark place,</v>

1361
01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.420
<v Speaker 4>too much alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too much drugs,</v>

1362
01:05:59.421 --> 01:06:01.850
<v Speaker 4>not getting along with her father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not getting along with her mother,</v>

1363
01:06:01.851 --> 01:06:04.070
<v Speaker 4>not having a vision for their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being nihilistic,</v>

1364
01:06:04.071 --> 01:06:06.020
<v Speaker 4>playing too many video games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1365
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.260
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1366
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.070
<v Speaker 4>being suicidal that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens a lot.</v>

1367
01:06:10.071 --> 01:06:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Having posttraumatic stress disorder </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes as a consequences of combat,</v>

1368
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.890
<v Speaker 4>whatever little slice of hell they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupied,</v>

1369
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:17.061
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1370
01:06:17.061 --> 01:06:18.920
<v Speaker 4>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been listening to your lectures and</v>

1371
01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:19.754
<v Speaker 4>I've been developing a vision for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and I've been trying to take </v>

1372
01:06:21.471 --> 01:06:22.304
<v Speaker 4>responsibility and I've been trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the truth and things are way </v>

1373
01:06:25.011 --> 01:06:28.130
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's absolutely perfect.</v>

1374
01:06:28.131 --> 01:06:30.530
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the right way forward as far as I'm</v>

1375
01:06:30.531 --> 01:06:32.180
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those are people who,</v>

1376
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:33.860
<v Speaker 4>they took stock of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

1377
01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:34.694
<v Speaker 4>I'm in a dark place and I'm a dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and here's some things that this </v>

1378
01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:41.750
<v Speaker 4>dark person in this dark place could do.</v>

1379
01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Little things that they could actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1380
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll clean up my damn room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll make my bed.</v>

1381
01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:47.443
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many people have come </v>

1382
01:06:48.981 --> 01:06:50.660
<v Speaker 4>and told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange.</v>

1383
01:06:50.661 --> 01:06:51.021
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1384
01:06:51.021 --> 01:06:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I started making my bed and that made </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the difference.</v>

1385
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:54.171
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1386
01:06:54.171 --> 01:06:55.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide a day mop man,</v>

1387
01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.953
<v Speaker 4>and the first concrete instantiation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was that you made your bed and you </v>

1388
01:06:59.571 --> 01:06:59.841
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1389
01:06:59.841 --> 01:07:01.250
<v Speaker 4>that's nothing heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1390
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.080
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but aiming up his heroic,</v>

1391
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.093
<v Speaker 4>that something and then lowering </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to the point where you're not </v>

1392
01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:11.660
<v Speaker 4>above the mess in your room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you're not super ordinate too,</v>

1393
01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:15.740
<v Speaker 4>that you lower yourself so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>straighten up your grateful for what you</v>

1394
01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:18.440
<v Speaker 4>have right in front of you and you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of it and you put it in order.</v>

1395
01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.453
<v Speaker 4>It's like all of a sudden things start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get better and so wonderful to be </v>

1396
01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:25.430
<v Speaker 4>doing this tour because see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see,</v>

1397
01:07:25.431 --> 01:07:27.890
<v Speaker 4>so that's what this tour has been about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me.</v>

1398
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.813
<v Speaker 4>It's not political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never talked to people after the </v>

1399
01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:32.180
<v Speaker 4>talks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1400
01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I talked to about 150 people a night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We never talk about anything political.</v>

1401
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 4>It's always this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't doing very well.</v>

1402
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting my life together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting along better with my father.</v>

1403
01:07:41.651 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting along better with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting along better with my kids.</v>

1404
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 4>I've got some meaning in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks a lot.</v>

1405
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 4>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1406
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

1407
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:52.923
<v Speaker 2>That's the right thing and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial for people and they need to </v>

1408
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:57.154
<v Speaker 2>hear that and there's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes along with that that's critical </v>

1409
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:02.723
<v Speaker 2>and what that is is an honest assessment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yourself and honesty that that type </v>

1410
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.300
<v Speaker 2>of honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty with yourself.</v>

1411
01:08:11.301 --> 01:08:12.134
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for some people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the tools for it and </v>

1412
01:08:13.971 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been explained to do this.</v>

1413
01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:17.603
<v Speaker 3>Why you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through school,</v>

1415
01:08:19.581 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 3>you're told what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're Never told how to think.</v>

1416
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:24.740
<v Speaker 3>He never told that you're okay the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

1417
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>That's self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're okay the way you are.</v>

1418
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:27.921
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1419
01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:28.754
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another thing where you are </v>

1420
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 3>and you're not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're okay as a human look,</v>

1421
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:34.424
<v Speaker 3>if you want to be a black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu and you just started your first </v>

1422
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're okay as you are,</v>

1423
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:42.230
<v Speaker 3>you are human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the goal you're not okay,</v>

1424
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:43.363
<v Speaker 3>and the greater goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incremental improvement is </v>

1425
01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:46.400
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

1426
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 3>You have to honestly assess your </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and move forward.</v>

1427
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1428
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.980
<v Speaker 3>You're a position in the trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1429
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you say to someone,</v>

1430
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:56.023
<v Speaker 3>you're okay because of your position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good enough because you have </v>

1431
01:08:58.671 --> 01:08:59.091
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1432
01:08:59.091 --> 01:08:59.660
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>

1433
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:00.493
<v Speaker 3>You need a trajectory and maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay if you're okay and your position </v>

1434
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.094
<v Speaker 3>and your trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know the self esteem movement </v>

1435
01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:08.600
<v Speaker 3>and all of that will accept yourself the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way you are.</v>

1436
01:09:08.601 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no because you need a trajectory and one</v>

1437
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:12.854
<v Speaker 3>of the things that that I think one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons that audiences are </v>

1438
01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.184
<v Speaker 3>responding to what I've been saying in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my lectures and what I've been writing </v>

1439
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:22.270
<v Speaker 3>about is that I don't tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're okay the way they are now.</v>

1440
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:22.691
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1441
01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be way more than you are,</v>

1442
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.330
<v Speaker 3>and they're relieved about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

1443
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:27.164
<v Speaker 3>because if you're in a dark and terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>place and someone says you're okay the </v>

1444
01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:31.244
<v Speaker 3>way you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't know what to do about </v>

1445
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1446
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:33.673
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1447
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm having to having a terrible time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hopeless.</v>

1448
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:37.940
<v Speaker 3>You're okay the way you are.</v>

1449
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1450
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.060
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1451
01:09:41.061 --> 01:09:43.550
<v Speaker 3>That's where I am and what do you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell a young person,</v>

1452
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:44.960
<v Speaker 3>you're 17 year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1453
01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 3>the way you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1454
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:46.634
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

1455
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.760
<v Speaker 3>You've got 60 years to be better and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be way better.</v>

1456
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:53.930
<v Speaker 3>You could be in comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better across multiple dimensions and in</v>

1457
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:54.764
<v Speaker 3>pursuing that better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you'll find the meaning in </v>

1458
01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 3>your life and that will give you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antidote to the suffering.</v>

1459
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 3>The way I always describe it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's,</v>

1460
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:03.740
<v Speaker 3>there are disciplines that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursue.</v>

1461
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Those disciplines are a vehicle for </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing your human potential,</v>

1462
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.233
<v Speaker 3>and if you get better at these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get better at anything and if </v>

1463
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:11.894
<v Speaker 3>you figure out what it takes to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at whatever sport it is or </v>

1464
01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:17.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever art it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>

1465
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 3>you're pursuing the same principles you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can apply to the way you treat people,</v>

1466
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 3>you can apply to the way you educate </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1467
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.750
<v Speaker 3>You can apply to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You keep your body in shape.</v>

1468
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.913
<v Speaker 3>All those things are connected and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you have to import impose </v>

1469
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:31.274
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have asked me in my book why I </v>

1470
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 3>wrote it as an antidote to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1471
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.260
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1472
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.110
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything technically wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with chaos.</v>

1473
01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Chaos is a place of great potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1474
01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:42.284
<v Speaker 3>the question is what's the proper?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the proper balance between chaos </v>

1475
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:47.360
<v Speaker 3>and order?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chaos potential in order.</v>

1476
01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:49.520
<v Speaker 3>While the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1477
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:51.110
<v Speaker 3>when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all potential.</v>

1478
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:52.183
<v Speaker 3>It's chaotic potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can manifest itself in any number of </v>

1479
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:57.140
<v Speaker 3>ways and maybe you don't want to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>that up so you're like peter pan,</v>

1480
01:10:57.141 --> 01:10:57.974
<v Speaker 3>you want to be a kid forever because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to give up the potential and </v>

1481
01:11:00.231 --> 01:11:02.330
<v Speaker 3>you look out in the world and all you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see are captain hook's,</v>

1482
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:03.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've lost a hand who were chased by </v>

1483
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:07.100
<v Speaker 3>death because that's the clock and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodile.</v>

1484
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It's already got a taste of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified by death and he's a tyrant.</v>

1485
01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to grow up to be that,</v>

1486
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.860
<v Speaker 3>so I won't be at all.</v>

1487
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.083
<v Speaker 4>Well that's no good because the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential transforms itself into </v>

1488
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 4>actuality is through discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you,</v>

1489
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 4>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the trick though.</v>

1490
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:27.960
<v Speaker 4>You have to pick a path of discipline </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether what path of discipline you have</v>

1491
01:11:27.961 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 4>to pick as a different issue because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there couldn't be a rule.</v>

1492
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.810
<v Speaker 4>The rule could be the rule might not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>followed.</v>

1493
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:34.644
<v Speaker 4>This rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rule might be you have to follow </v>

1494
01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:38.154
<v Speaker 4>some rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a matter rule and the mega rule </v>

1495
01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 4>is you have to discipline yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the issue is,</v>

1496
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.214
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how that's not really the relevant </v>

1497
01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can pick a disciplinary path.</v>

1498
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:49.980
<v Speaker 4>That's why I often tell my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially young people,</v>

1499
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:50.341
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1500
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:51.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1501
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody does go do something.</v>

1502
01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:56.363
<v Speaker 4>Do the best thing that you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put the best plan you have into </v>

1503
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:00.180
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

1504
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.580
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to be perfect and it will</v>
<v Speaker 4>change along the way,</v>

1505
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 4>but it will change partly because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>become disciplined pursuing the path and</v>

1506
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:07.104
<v Speaker 4>as you become disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become wiser and as you become </v>

1507
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:09.954
<v Speaker 4>wiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become able to formulate better and </v>

1508
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:12.144
<v Speaker 4>better plans so you can start vaguely </v>
<v Speaker 4>and confused and develop a plan that's </v>

1509
01:12:16.171 --> 01:12:18.470
<v Speaker 4>not so great and you start to implement </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and then you,</v>

1510
01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:19.443
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You accrue incremental wisdom as you </v>

1511
01:12:21.241 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 4>implement your flawed plan and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>enables you to fix the plant.</v>

1512
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:28.590
<v Speaker 4>And so that's part of that process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>incremental self improvement as well.</v>

1513
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.910
<v Speaker 2>One of the more difficult aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is personal honesty,</v>

1514
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.833
<v Speaker 2>like being honest with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being honest with yourself about what </v>

1515
01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:36.110
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self assessment.</v>

1516
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

1517
01:12:37.761 --> 01:12:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They're never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're never taught it.</v>

1518
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that's encouraged.</v>

1519
01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dismal.</v>

1520
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.640
<v Speaker 4>I imagine you only got 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only have $100,000</v>

1521
01:12:44.641 --> 01:12:47.830
<v Speaker 4>to go buy a house and so you go buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>gold,</v>

1522
01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.480
<v Speaker 4>look at this house and It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus,</v>

1523
01:12:49.481 --> 01:12:50.620
<v Speaker 4>this house man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1524
01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:52.660
<v Speaker 4>it needs a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1525
01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:53.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all you've got,</v>

1526
01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.920
<v Speaker 4>or are you going to pretend that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>house is okay the way it is?</v>

1527
01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:57.993
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to look for where it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>rotten and where the plumbing doesn't </v>

1528
01:12:59.561 --> 01:13:00.394
<v Speaker 4>work and where the stove doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go and look and see where </v>

1529
01:13:02.441 --> 01:13:04.700
<v Speaker 4>everything needs to be fixed and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1530
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.790
<v Speaker 4>that is harsh man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1531
01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:09.750
<v Speaker 4>and then in order to do that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone has to have taught you.</v>

1532
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:10.121
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1533
01:13:10.121 --> 01:13:12.040
<v Speaker 4>you aren't your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1534
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:12.874
<v Speaker 4>you are your most fundamentally that </v>
<v Speaker 4>which if it confronts it's problems can </v>

1535
01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 4>solve them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the hero myth in in a,</v>

1536
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.820
<v Speaker 4>in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1537
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.610
<v Speaker 4>the hero is the person who confronts </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible,</v>

1538
01:13:24.611 --> 01:13:27.730
<v Speaker 4>chaotic potential and tames it and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>something of it right?</v>

1539
01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:28.983
<v Speaker 4>That's the fundamental human story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is is that you have to </v>

1540
01:13:31.751 --> 01:13:33.970
<v Speaker 4>face what you don't want to face in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to fix it.</v>

1541
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.133
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you look at all the things about </v>

1542
01:13:36.171 --> 01:13:37.004
<v Speaker 4>yourself that needs to be burned off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that needed to be dispensed with and </v>

1543
01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.630
<v Speaker 4>that man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially at the beginning,</v>

1544
01:13:41.631 --> 01:13:42.464
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be like 95 percent of you </v>

1545
01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.930
<v Speaker 4>just has to go up in flames and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>painful.</v>

1546
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Even some of that stuff that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>burn off doesn't want to die and it will</v>

1547
01:13:51.351 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 4>scream in agony while you're burning it </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1548
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.613
<v Speaker 4>It's not pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you know that you're the thing </v>

1549
01:13:56.811 --> 01:13:59.180
<v Speaker 4>that can transcend your problems most </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally,</v>

1550
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:03.830
<v Speaker 4>if you know you're the thing that if it </v>
<v Speaker 4>faces the problems can transcend them,</v>

1551
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.040
<v Speaker 4>then you have the faith that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>enable you to take stock of who you are.</v>

1552
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.093
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to do that in small steps </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most people don't have </v>

1553
01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:11.034
<v Speaker 2>experience in their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they really don't know what it even </v>

1554
01:14:13.211 --> 01:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like an alien concept.</v>

1555
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It seems like something other people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1556
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:18.703
<v Speaker 2>but if you do it incrementally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can show yourself that you can do </v>

1557
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:21.851
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1558
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:25.040
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the reasons why they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt systems and martial arts.</v>

1559
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 2>You start off slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1560
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I got a stripe on my white belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

1561
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm a blue belt and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel improvement.</v>

1562
01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for some people it's the first real </v>

1563
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>improvement marked absolute improvement </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their life.</v>

1564
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:38.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1565
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting thing too,</v>

1566
01:14:40.691 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 4>because right there you've got a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a measurement system.</v>

1567
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.403
<v Speaker 4>We have this system set up online called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the future authoring program and we've </v>

1568
01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:50.380
<v Speaker 4>employed last time we implemented it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we've tested it three times.</v>

1569
01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:51.214
<v Speaker 4>We implemented at mohawk college in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada and we had people write about </v>

1570
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 4>their ideal future and also to put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurement strategies.</v>

1571
01:14:58.511 --> 01:14:59.051
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1572
01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:01.450
<v Speaker 4>here's your ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how you're going to break it into</v>

1573
01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:04.120
<v Speaker 4>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's how you're going to mark progress</v>

1574
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 4>towards those goals because you've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be playing a fair game with yourself,</v>

1575
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:09.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you make progress,</v>

1576
01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:09.904
<v Speaker 4>you want to reward yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to identify what the </v>

1577
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:12.364
<v Speaker 4>progress is and you have to reward it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The consequence we had people write a </v>

1578
01:15:15.731 --> 01:15:20.731
<v Speaker 4>future plan for only an hour when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>came for their school orientation in the</v>

1579
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 4>summer before going to.</v>

1580
01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.323
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a community college and they </v>

1581
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:28.180
<v Speaker 4>dropped the dropout rate among young men</v>
<v Speaker 4>by 50 percent and is.</v>

1582
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no kidding.</v>

1583
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Fifty percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1584
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.133
<v Speaker 4>and what that meant was to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that meant was just think about </v>

1585
01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:36.940
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means is that these kids being</v>

1586
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 4>educated for 12 years and no one had </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever sat them down and said,</v>

1587
01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:40.804
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell are you doing and why and </v>

1588
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1589
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:46.120
<v Speaker 4>where do you want to go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you want to get there?</v>

1590
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.760
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to mark your progress?</v>

1591
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I've never walked them through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise.</v>

1592
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:52.383
<v Speaker 4>You walk people through that exercise </v>
<v Speaker 4>just to get them to do that increases </v>

1593
01:15:55.571 --> 01:15:59.070
<v Speaker 4>the probability that they'll stay on </v>
<v Speaker 4>track by 50 percent does incredible.</v>

1594
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:00.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things I've always </v>

1595
01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:04.670
<v Speaker 2>complained about is that they know one </v>
<v Speaker 2>or two people teach you facts.</v>

1596
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:06.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't teach you how to approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1597
01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.113
<v Speaker 2>They don't teach you how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't teach you how to confront </v>

1598
01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.160
<v Speaker 2>white insecurities and different traps </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your mind will set up for you.</v>

1599
01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.873
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's what partly what's so fun </v>

1600
01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:18.374
<v Speaker 4>about doing this lecture to her because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what I'm talking to </v>

1601
01:16:20.211 --> 01:16:22.340
<v Speaker 4>people about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I talk about is,</v>

1602
01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:23.270
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think?</v>

1603
01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Why bother thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1604
01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:26.571
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1605
01:16:26.571 --> 01:16:27.620
<v Speaker 4>that's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1606
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.300
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually it's not so obvious.</v>

1607
01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

1608
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 4>The issue that I discussed with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>students at university a lot is,</v>

1609
01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:34.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why write a good essay?</v>

1610
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.570
<v Speaker 4>Why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well to get the grade.</v>

1611
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:38.404
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1612
01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.260
<v Speaker 4>that's not why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you think that,</v>

1613
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:44.280
<v Speaker 4>well that's better than not thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's any reason for writing,</v>

1614
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's a bad reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1615
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing is a form of thinking.</v>

1616
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:50.890
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the most demanding form of</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

1617
01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other forms that are demanding,</v>

1618
01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:58.840
<v Speaker 4>so how do you write a good essay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pick a topic that matters to you because</v>

1619
01:16:58.841 --> 01:17:01.000
<v Speaker 4>if you're not writing about something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that matters to you,</v>

1620
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:04.120
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're not living something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's meaningful.</v>

1621
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.073
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to write a good essay </v>

1622
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:07.361
<v Speaker 4>because you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1623
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:08.800
<v Speaker 4>To begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to matter to you.</v>

1624
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does it matter?</v>

1625
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean that it matters?</v>

1626
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.843
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means that it's going to affect how </v>

1627
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:15.584
<v Speaker 4>you make decisions in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that matters affects how you </v>

1628
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:20.240
<v Speaker 4>make decisions in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1629
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:22.490
<v Speaker 4>why does it matter how you make </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions in your life?</v>

1630
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:23.803
<v Speaker 4>Because if you make stupid decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to increase the sum total </v>

1631
01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:28.814
<v Speaker 4>of suffering a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to do stupid things to </v>

1632
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:31.784
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to do stupid things to </v>

1633
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 4>other people and you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>as good a person as you could be.</v>

1634
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:38.300
<v Speaker 4>So not only will you do stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible things,</v>

1635
01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:39.134
<v Speaker 4>but you won't have manifested the good </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world that you could have </v>

1636
01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:43.180
<v Speaker 4>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the luck.</v>

1637
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.550
<v Speaker 4>So you write an essay so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>think and you think so that you can live</v>

1638
01:17:46.551 --> 01:17:48.740
<v Speaker 4>properly and so you're right damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>carefully.</v>

1639
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:49.574
<v Speaker 4>You make sure that every single bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>word is a word that you want to use and </v>

1640
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:53.594
<v Speaker 4>you make sure the phrases that you put </v>
<v Speaker 4>the words in or as solid as they can be </v>

1641
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:57.163
<v Speaker 4>and you make sure the sentences are well</v>
<v Speaker 4>constructed and that they're organized </v>

1642
01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:00.464
<v Speaker 4>into proper paragraphs and paragraphs </v>
<v Speaker 4>are sequenced and the content of the </v>

1643
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:04.244
<v Speaker 4>thing matters and you put your soul into</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and you know when you've done that </v>

1644
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.110
<v Speaker 4>because it's gripping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you write,</v>

1645
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.230
<v Speaker 4>it's meaningfully engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is another thing that I've been</v>

1646
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:16.550
<v Speaker 4>sharing with my audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning is actually an instinct like you</v>

1647
01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:17.510
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1648
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 4>so we already decided that incremental </v>
<v Speaker 4>self improvement is the proper route.</v>

1649
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:23.623
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how do you know when you're </v>

1650
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 4>incrementally self improving properly?</v>

1651
01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is it's deeply engaging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's deeply meaningful,</v>

1652
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:30.343
<v Speaker 4>and the reason for that is you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually adapted neurologically to </v>

1653
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 4>identify the pathway of maximal </v>
<v Speaker 4>incremental improvement.</v>

1654
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:37.723
<v Speaker 4>That was a discovery conceptually by guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>named vygotsky who was a russian </v>

1655
01:18:40.611 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychologist who coined the term </v>
<v Speaker 4>zone of proximal development.</v>

1656
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 4>You here now and then people say they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the zone.</v>

1657
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:50.430
<v Speaker 4>That's the zone of proximal development </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's that place that you occupy.</v>

1658
01:18:50.431 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 4>When you're improving at the rate that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>optimal to you,</v>

1659
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:54.703
<v Speaker 4>and your sense of intrinsic meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>signifies that that's how you're bloody </v>

1660
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:00.290
<v Speaker 4>brain is wired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you might say,</v>

1661
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:01.124
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the antidote to the tragedy and </v>

1662
01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:05.030
<v Speaker 4>malevolence of life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is to put yourself in the</v>

1663
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:05.864
<v Speaker 4>zone of proximal development because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where the maximum meaning is and </v>

1664
01:19:08.451 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 4>that actually does prepare you for life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the question,</v>

1665
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.793
<v Speaker 4>why think as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think before you act and you act to </v>

1666
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.843
<v Speaker 4>put yourself in the zone of proximal </v>
<v Speaker 4>development and you do that too as an </v>

1667
01:19:19.641 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 4>antidote to the catastrophe of life.</v>

1668
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the.</v>

1669
01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:23.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the answer.</v>

1670
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.120
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that's cool about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a thing,</v>

1671
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:31.040
<v Speaker 4>part of what I've been telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of novel as well.</v>

1672
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.100
<v Speaker 4>Where's the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 4>the meaning is in responsibility.</v>

1673
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.530
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people avoid response.</v>

1674
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.840
<v Speaker 4>That's peter pan again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid responsibilities,</v>

1675
01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 4>just a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like no,</v>

1676
01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:41.450
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a burden,</v>

1677
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.553
<v Speaker 4>but voluntarily hoisted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the place of maximum meaning and </v>

1678
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 4>the more responsibility you take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more meaning you have.</v>

1679
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:50.600
<v Speaker 4>And that's the antidote to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of life.</v>

1680
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:51.763
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody also knows this because </v>

1681
01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:57.030
<v Speaker 4>just look so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you are,</v>

1682
01:19:57.031 --> 01:19:58.940
<v Speaker 4>you sick of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1683
01:19:58.941 --> 01:19:59.774
<v Speaker 4>that's when you're being useless and </v>
<v Speaker 4>irresponsible for yourself and for your </v>

1684
01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:03.854
<v Speaker 4>family and for your community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not even taking care of yourself </v>

1685
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sleep with a clean conscience unless</v>

1686
01:20:09.451 --> 01:20:10.284
<v Speaker 4>you're a psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're not taking care of </v>

1687
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:12.054
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1688
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 4>And then when can you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when are you not awake in the morning,</v>

1689
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:15.924
<v Speaker 4>at three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tearing yourself apart with a guilty </v>

1690
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:20.130
<v Speaker 4>conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when you've done something useful,</v>

1691
01:20:20.131 --> 01:20:22.710
<v Speaker 4>at least for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when you can say,</v>

1692
01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:24.540
<v Speaker 4>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check one on my side.</v>

1693
01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.531
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1694
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:26.364
<v Speaker 4>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You talked a little responsibility for </v>

1695
01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 4>yourself and you can sleep with a clean </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscience.</v>

1696
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 4>What happens if you adopted full </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for yourself and then for</v>

1697
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:34.494
<v Speaker 4>your family?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of the people that are coming to </v>

1698
01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 4>talk to me say now I've been really </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to put my family together.</v>

1699
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:40.223
<v Speaker 4>Like I've made that a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to heal my family and bring </v>

1700
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 4>it together and it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's a story.</v>

1701
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I love this story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1702
01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 4>It just killed me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in la at the orpheum and you know,</v>

1703
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:50.754
<v Speaker 4>it's rough downtown in la,</v>
<v Speaker 4>places around the orpheum to and tammy </v>

1704
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:54.804
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife,</v>

1705
01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 4>because she's traveling with me and is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>big help by the way.</v>

1706
01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:03.510
<v Speaker 4>We're wandering around downtown la that </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning after the talk and we're walking</v>

1707
01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 4>down the street and we were on streets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We probably Shouldn't have been on,</v>

1708
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:06.923
<v Speaker 4>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what the hell do we know being </v>

1709
01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:11.280
<v Speaker 4>stupid canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we're walking down the street and</v>

1710
01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:12.203
<v Speaker 4>this car pulled up beside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this kid hopped out and it's good </v>

1711
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 4>looking latino kid,</v>

1712
01:21:15.481 --> 01:21:16.470
<v Speaker 4>21,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1713
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.810
<v Speaker 4>He jumped over and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's all excited.</v>

1714
01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:19.644
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you dr?</v>

1715
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:20.640
<v Speaker 4>Peterson said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1716
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.503
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1717
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really happy to meet you.</v>

1718
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.290
<v Speaker 4>I've been watching your lectures for </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a year and a half and uh,</v>

1719
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:29.690
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to put my life together</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's really working.</v>

1720
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm really doing way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really wanted to thank you.</v>

1721
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 4>And so it's lovely a when you're walking</v>
<v Speaker 4>down and kind of rough area and somebody</v>

1722
01:21:36.211 --> 01:21:37.044
<v Speaker 4>pulls up beside you and they jump out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the car to tell you how much better </v>

1723
01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:40.314
<v Speaker 4>their life is.</v>

1724
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a pretty good morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>

1725
01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:43.680
<v Speaker 4>But then that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened.</v>

1726
01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 4>He ran back to his car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1727
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:46.704
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

1728
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:47.703
<v Speaker 4>We went back to his car and he got out </v>
<v Speaker 4>his dad and they came over together and </v>

1729
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 4>his dad was just smiling away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a real smile,</v>

1730
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:55.314
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so as the kid and they had their </v>

1731
01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:57.174
<v Speaker 4>arms around each other and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look like we've really been working on </v>

1732
01:21:59.491 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 4>our relationship for the last year and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>half and it's cold and just create,</v>

1733
01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:04.200
<v Speaker 4>we want to thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the father said something like,</v>

1734
01:22:04.201 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy that you got my son </v>
<v Speaker 4>back to me.</v>

1735
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

1736
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 4>that's what this bloody tour has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1737
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:11.243
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody that's coming to these </v>

1738
01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 4>talks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're trying to do.</v>

1739
01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.253
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I goT 3000 people in each audience and </v>

1740
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:18.534
<v Speaker 4>what they're trying to do is figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I take maximal responsibility </v>

1741
01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:22.710
<v Speaker 4>for my own life?</v>

1742
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.693
<v Speaker 4>How can I am bw it with the meaning that</v>
<v Speaker 4>helps me with stan tragedy and </v>

1743
01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:26.994
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can I be a better person and </v>

1744
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:29.663
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't it be great if that was of </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimal benefit to my family and the </v>

1745
01:22:32.161 --> 01:22:34.180
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get very emotional about that.</v>

1746
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's something joe jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen like 150,000</v>

1747
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:40.050
<v Speaker 4>people in the last two months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1748
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 4>and this is what it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1749
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a chance to talk to reuben </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this too.</v>

1750
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.450
<v Speaker 4>This is what it's been like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so positive.</v>

1751
01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:46.284
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just one person after another </v>

1752
01:22:48.721 --> 01:22:49.620
<v Speaker 4>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1753
01:22:49.621 --> 01:22:51.660
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was having a rough time.</v>

1754
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:52.853
<v Speaker 4>I'm really happy that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountering what you've been talking </v>

1755
01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:55.554
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've really been trying to put things </v>

1756
01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:58.340
<v Speaker 4>together and it's really helping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You havE.</v>

1757
01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Ruben was pretty blown away by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a long conversation about it,</v>

1758
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:02.514
<v Speaker 4>about he just feels like there's some </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy movement going on if something's </v>

1759
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 4>changing in the world</v>

1760
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.873
<v Speaker 2>because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new avenue of learning and </v>

1761
01:23:09.131 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 2>development is opening up</v>

1762
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 4>for these people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1763
01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:14.280
<v Speaker 4>I know I've been thinking about that too</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

1764
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:15.770
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said at the beginning,</v>

1765
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:16.723
<v Speaker 4>if you're surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to take responsibility </v>

1766
01:23:18.141 --> 01:23:19.220
<v Speaker 4>for the wave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1767
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1768
01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:20.983
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of what I've been telling people </v>

1769
01:23:22.191 --> 01:23:25.220
<v Speaker 4>are things that I've gleaned from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical literature in the psychological</v>

1770
01:23:25.221 --> 01:23:27.500
<v Speaker 4>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I'm coming up with this of</v>

1771
01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:28.520
<v Speaker 4>my own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1772
01:23:28.521 --> 01:23:30.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm transmitting information that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned from very,</v>

1773
01:23:30.831 --> 01:23:33.170
<v Speaker 4>very wise people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's that.</v>

1774
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:37.550
<v Speaker 4>But also we don't want to underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>the utility of the technology,</v>

1775
01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.413
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we have this long form </v>

1776
01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.214
<v Speaker 4>technology now and it's enabling us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this discussion and so we can get </v>

1777
01:23:43.911 --> 01:23:46.460
<v Speaker 4>deeper into things publicly and </v>
<v Speaker 4>socially.</v>

1778
01:23:46.461 --> 01:23:48.950
<v Speaker 4>Then we were able to before and I see </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1779
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.970
<v Speaker 4>I see this as a manifestation of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1780
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 4>and as an.</v>

1781
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.113
<v Speaker 4>And I'm hoping to that maybe maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening because we were going </v>

1782
01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.910
<v Speaker 4>to have a lot of adaptation to do in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next 20 years.</v>

1783
01:23:58.911 --> 01:24:01.730
<v Speaker 4>As things change so rapidly we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly comprehend it.</v>

1784
01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:05.720
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully the way we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to manage that is to think.</v>

1785
01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.453
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully these long form </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussions will provide the political </v>

1786
01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.400
<v Speaker 4>or provide the public forum for us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually think,</v>

1787
01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.890
<v Speaker 4>to actually engage at a deep enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>

1788
01:24:15.891 --> 01:24:16.724
<v Speaker 4>So we built a master the transformations</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's possible and part of </v>

1789
01:24:20.391 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 4>the reason that I wrote this book and </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1790
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:23.743
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason that I'd be doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I've been doing for the last 30 </v>

1791
01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:28.760
<v Speaker 4>years is because I really have believed </v>
<v Speaker 4>since 1985,</v>

1792
01:24:28.761 --> 01:24:29.594
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the way out of political </v>

1793
01:24:30.801 --> 01:24:33.770
<v Speaker 4>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way out of the excesses of the right</v>

1794
01:24:33.771 --> 01:24:36.350
<v Speaker 4>and the left is through the individual.</v>

1795
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.393
<v Speaker 4>I think the west got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fundamentaL unit of measurement is </v>

1796
01:24:40.551 --> 01:24:41.384
<v Speaker 4>the individual and the fundamental task </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the individual is to engage in this </v>

1797
01:24:44.811 --> 01:24:45.644
<v Speaker 4>process of humble self improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that's the case and that's </v>

1798
01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:50.600
<v Speaker 4>where the meaning is and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the responsibility is.</v>

1799
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.823
<v Speaker 4>And I think and I'm hoping that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough people in the west and then and </v>

1800
01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:56.630
<v Speaker 4>then the rest of the world for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter,</v>

1801
01:24:56.631 --> 01:24:58.940
<v Speaker 4>but we're very polarized in the west </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1802
01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.870
<v Speaker 4>If enough people take responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting their individual lives together,</v>

1803
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:03.973
<v Speaker 4>then we'll get wise enough so we won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>let this process of political </v>

1804
01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:10.550
<v Speaker 4>polarization put us back to the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>places that we went so many times in the</v>

1805
01:25:10.551 --> 01:25:13.310
<v Speaker 4>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see another antidote for it.</v>

1806
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:15.890
<v Speaker 4>It's not political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ethical.</v>

1807
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.400
<v Speaker 2>This is the message that I alWays hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>from you and this is you as a friend.</v>

1808
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.753
<v Speaker 2>This is the you that I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is not how you're commonly </v>

1809
01:25:26.301 --> 01:25:27.134
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the most misrepresented person </v>

1810
01:25:28.971 --> 01:25:29.804
<v Speaker 2>I've ever met in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have never seen someone who has so </v>

1811
01:25:35.121 --> 01:25:35.954
<v Speaker 2>much positive that gets ignored and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are looking for any little </v>

1812
01:25:41.631 --> 01:25:46.100
<v Speaker 2>thing that they could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent and switch up and change,</v>

1813
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:51.550
<v Speaker 2>and I'm kind of stunned by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not sure what it is about you</v>

1814
01:25:52.161 --> 01:25:52.994
<v Speaker 2>that's so polarizing with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people that are deciding that </v>

1815
01:25:58.761 --> 01:26:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you are some sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transphobic,</v>

1816
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 2>evil person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this right wing.</v>

1817
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figure.</v>

1818
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even to the point where it's,</v>

1819
01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:12.993
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of humorous to me sometimes </v>

1820
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.020
<v Speaker 2>when I read some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these takes on you.</v>

1821
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that's from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1822
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 2>What is have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing for you.</v>

1823
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.593
<v Speaker 2>You mean it's only been the last few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that you've gone from this </v>

1824
01:26:29.511 --> 01:26:30.344
<v Speaker 2>relatively unknown professor in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>university in toronto to being this </v>

1825
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:36.044
<v Speaker 2>worldwide figure where people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously your message is resonating </v>

1826
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:41.804
<v Speaker 2>with people in a very huge way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people that are opposing you </v>

1827
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:50.870
<v Speaker 2>vehemently opposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WhaT do you think that is</v>

1828
01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:52.063
<v Speaker 4>collected?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't like me collectivists and what do </v>

1829
01:26:54.701 --> 01:26:55.534
<v Speaker 4>you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who think the probably proper </v>

1830
01:26:58.061 --> 01:27:01.660
<v Speaker 4>unit of analysis in the worlD is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>political and be group oriented.</v>

1831
01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.350
<v Speaker 4>The identity politics types don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>me at all and they have every reason not</v>

1832
01:27:05.351 --> 01:27:09.190
<v Speaker 4>to because I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a fan of identity politics.</v>

1833
01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:12.430
<v Speaker 4>I think things are misrepresented </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally.</v>

1834
01:27:12.670 --> 01:27:13.503
<v Speaker 4>There's other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I came out against this bill in </v>

1835
01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:16.444
<v Speaker 4>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bill see 16 that that hyPothetically </v>

1836
01:27:18.551 --> 01:27:19.384
<v Speaker 4>purported to do nothing else but to </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase the domain of rights that were </v>

1837
01:27:23.201 --> 01:27:26.030
<v Speaker 4>applied to transsexual people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was a.</v>

1838
01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.060
<v Speaker 4>There was plenty more to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bail bad.</v>

1839
01:27:28.061 --> 01:27:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I read the policy,</v>

1840
01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.280
<v Speaker 4>the policies that went along with it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a compelled speech bill,</v>

1841
01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:37.480
<v Speaker 4>and so I opposed it on the grounds that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the politicians are not supposed to leap</v>

1842
01:27:37.481 --> 01:27:40.930
<v Speaker 4>out of their proper domain and start to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compel speech.</v>

1843
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:42.760
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same as forbidding hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech.</v>

1844
01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:43.653
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think hate speech should be left the </v>

1845
01:27:44.651 --> 01:27:46.570
<v Speaker 4>hell alone personally for all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons,</v>

1846
01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:50.410
<v Speaker 4>but to compel the contents of speech is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole new thing.</v>

1847
01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:53.260
<v Speaker 4>It's never been done before in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of british common law,</v>

1848
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:54.123
<v Speaker 4>english common law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually the supreme court in </v>

1849
01:27:56.201 --> 01:27:57.034
<v Speaker 4>the 19 forties in the us said that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was not to be allowed and so it was a </v>

1850
01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.020
<v Speaker 4>major transgression and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1851
01:28:02.021 --> 01:28:03.490
<v Speaker 4>we're doing it for all the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

1852
01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:04.091
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1853
01:28:04.091 --> 01:28:05.080
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get it.</v>

1854
01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.213
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to compel speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what your reasons are and </v>

1855
01:28:09.281 --> 01:28:11.410
<v Speaker 4>why should I trust your damn reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways.</v>

1856
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.273
<v Speaker 4>What makes you so st like so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can violate this fundamental principle </v>

1857
01:28:15.881 --> 01:28:16.714
<v Speaker 4>and I should assume that you're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for nothing but compassion and that </v>

1858
01:28:18.491 --> 01:28:20.230
<v Speaker 4>you're wise enough to manage that </v>
<v Speaker 4>property.</v>

1859
01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

1860
01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:22.690
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read your policies.</v>

1861
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the collectivists.</v>

1862
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.530
<v Speaker 4>I think they're unbelievably dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have reason to believe that.</v>

1863
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.580
<v Speaker 4>So I think that when push comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shove,</v>

1864
01:28:33.610 --> 01:28:38.610
<v Speaker 4>if your unit of analysis is the group </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your worldview is one group and it's</v>

1865
01:28:39.251 --> 01:28:41.250
<v Speaker 4>power claims against all other groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1866
01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:43.260
<v Speaker 4>that that's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT's,</v>

1867
01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.193
<v Speaker 4>it's tribalism of the worst form and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead to nothing but mayhem and disaster </v>

1868
01:28:47.610 --> 01:28:48.443
<v Speaker 4>and part of the reason you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't because you're compassionate </v>

1869
01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:53.040
<v Speaker 4>because you're envious and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to take responsibility for your own</v>

1870
01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:56.010
<v Speaker 4>life and I'm calling you on it and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't like me,</v>

1871
01:28:56.011 --> 01:29:00.570
<v Speaker 4>so I must be an outright figure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I must be a nazi saying your house needs</v>

1872
01:29:00.571 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 4>a lot of man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of rot in the floorboards.</v>

1873
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.300
<v Speaker 4>The plumbing is leaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the water's coming in.</v>

1874
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.190
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not the sage.</v>

1875
01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:09.024
<v Speaker 4>And st you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much work you have to do on </v>

1876
01:29:11.261 --> 01:29:13.630
<v Speaker 4>yourself that it would damn near kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to take a look at it,</v>

1877
01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 4>do everything want</v>

1878
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.263
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people are responding to you </v>

1879
01:29:17.991 --> 01:29:18.824
<v Speaker 2>in a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they only have their own personal </v>

1880
01:29:20.211 --> 01:29:21.044
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're avoiding the it can't </v>

1881
01:29:22.131 --> 01:29:22.964
<v Speaker 2>possibly be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you represent to them something </v>

1882
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:26.203
<v Speaker 2>that is either cruel or something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not compassionate about people and </v>

1883
01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:37.290
<v Speaker 2>their differences and their flaws and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1884
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:38.510
<v Speaker 2>their humanity.</v>

1885
01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:39.653
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's certainly the case that </v>

1886
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:44.340
<v Speaker 4>their vision that's been generated of me</v>
<v Speaker 4>is gas.</v>

1887
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:48.630
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm getting at too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why is layers say there's.</v>

1888
01:29:48.631 --> 01:29:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it's the,</v>

1889
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.600
<v Speaker 4>the political polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1890
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.513
<v Speaker 4>at the moment we're viewing almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that happens in the world </v>

1891
01:29:55.591 --> 01:29:58.350
<v Speaker 4>through a political lens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least the journalists at least.</v>

1892
01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 4>FIrst of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1893
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to make this clear.</v>

1894
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.473
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been treated well by lots of </v>

1895
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:10.010
<v Speaker 4>journalists really well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the best journalists in Canada have</v>

1896
01:30:10.011 --> 01:30:12.470
<v Speaker 4>been on my side since about two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the bill.</v>

1897
01:30:12.471 --> 01:30:13.304
<v Speaker 4>See 16 thing erupted and those would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the journalist that have an independent </v>

1898
01:30:16.281 --> 01:30:17.114
<v Speaker 4>voice and that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have created their own following </v>

1899
01:30:19.941 --> 01:30:22.470
<v Speaker 4>and they're in a number of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>media place.</v>

1900
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:24.440
<v Speaker 4>It's mostly in print.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1901
01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.310
<v Speaker 4>And there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a coalition of,</v>

1902
01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:30.080
<v Speaker 4>of newspapers in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the post media group,</v>

1903
01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:32.320
<v Speaker 4>200 newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came out fully and supportive.</v>

1904
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:34.160
<v Speaker 4>My stance on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on bill 60,</v>

1905
01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:37.970
<v Speaker 4>and so there's lots of times that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been treateD properly by journalists.</v>

1906
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:39.103
<v Speaker 4>There's a small number of journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very noisy and a small number of </v>

1907
01:30:41.661 --> 01:30:42.494
<v Speaker 4>activists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very well organized who have been on my </v>

1908
01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:45.794
<v Speaker 4>case right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those are people who are generally </v>

1909
01:30:47.991 --> 01:30:51.320
<v Speaker 4>driven by a very radical leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>progressive agenda.</v>

1910
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:56.180
<v Speaker 4>And I am not on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on their side as individuals.</v>

1911
01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm on their side is people Who could </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle forward,</v>

1912
01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.250
<v Speaker 4>but the collectivist vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's deadly,</v>

1913
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.440
<v Speaker 2>but you seem to be the poster boy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this very simple characterization.</v>

1914
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Like almost a caricature of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1915
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:13.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1916
01:31:13.170 --> 01:31:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the right figurehead is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1917
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.053
<v Speaker 2>it's to me as a person who knows you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange to watch this take </v>

1918
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:19.824
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they can find anything </v>

1919
01:31:22.081 --> 01:31:22.914
<v Speaker 2>that you say that could without further </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation or definition be </v>

1920
01:31:29.681 --> 01:31:34.240
<v Speaker 2>misconstrued as appealing to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of you.</v>

1921
01:31:34.450 --> 01:31:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when all this,</v>

1922
01:31:36.911 --> 01:31:38.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this.</v>

1923
01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess they call themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells,</v>

1924
01:31:42.491 --> 01:31:45.300
<v Speaker 2>involuntary celebrates when all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff went down with his car,</v>

1925
01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.670
<v Speaker 2>drove his car into a group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible tragedy.</v>

1926
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.980
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>within cells is that,</v>

1927
01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.950
<v Speaker 2>and this was a part of the role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

1928
01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.260
<v Speaker 2>It was a New York times piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1929
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.790
<v Speaker 3>You said one of the cures for this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforced monogamy.</v>

1930
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:05.343
<v Speaker 3>People decided and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard that term before quite </v>

1931
01:32:08.351 --> 01:32:09.370
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1932
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.570
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

1933
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:15.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a psychological term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And What it means is enforced by culture</v>

1934
01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:18.300
<v Speaker 3>that it is a good value monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:32:18.301 --> 01:32:19.134
<v Speaker 3>Because polygamy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>polygamous societies tend to become </v>

1936
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 3>ultra violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:23.194
<v Speaker 3>That's been known in the anthropological</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature for a hundred years and </v>

1938
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.020
<v Speaker 3>certainly leftist anthropologists were </v>
<v Speaker 3>among those who discovered it.</v>

1939
01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:29.873
<v Speaker 3>Like she knew the journalist knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly well what I meant by </v>

1940
01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:34.180
<v Speaker 3>enforcement origami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has stupid.</v>

1941
01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:35.043
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you use it as if everybody would </v>

1942
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:38.944
<v Speaker 3>understand it because you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual and because you're a </v>

1943
01:32:40.601 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 3>professor and assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

1944
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:45.430
<v Speaker 3>It was also two minutes out of a two day</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

1945
01:32:45.431 --> 01:32:46.264
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1946
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.490
<v Speaker 3>so if that's how she glanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1947
01:32:48.491 --> 01:32:49.324
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so funny.</v>

1948
01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.193
<v Speaker 3>That was funny in some sense because my </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense is if you want to pillory someone </v>

1949
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:54.333
<v Speaker 3>you should attribute to them views that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone somewhere has had and the </v>

1950
01:32:58.661 --> 01:32:59.494
<v Speaker 3>implication of that part of the New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>times article was that I wanted to take </v>

1951
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.713
<v Speaker 3>new bile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young women at the point of a gun </v>

1952
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.490
<v Speaker 3>understate enforcement and deliver them </v>
<v Speaker 3>to useless men.</v>

1953
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like no one has ever believed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>trinity sounds like that.</v>

1954
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 3>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The optics of that statement,</v>

1955
01:33:15.611 --> 01:33:18.820
<v Speaker 3>a very bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the question is why didn't.</v>

1956
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:19.683
<v Speaker 3>Why wasn't their followup questions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was follow up questions to get </v>

1957
01:33:22.211 --> 01:33:24.190
<v Speaker 3>you to define what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement.</v>

1958
01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.680
<v Speaker 3>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't make it into the piece.</v>

1959
01:33:26.681 --> 01:33:28.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:28.893
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real problem because that's </v>

1961
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:31.423
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

1962
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 3>It's so ridiculous because inaccurate </v>
<v Speaker 3>definition of who you are,</v>

1963
01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:35.993
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I've said continually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is on record in multiple </v>

1964
01:33:39.761 --> 01:33:40.600
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1965
01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.434
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're a young man and all the women </v>

1966
01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:44.830
<v Speaker 3>are rejecting you.</v>

1967
01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Who's got the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not all the women.</v>

1968
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad road to go down if all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women are rejecting you,</v>

1969
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.500
<v Speaker 3>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both agree on this,</v>

1970
01:33:56.501 --> 01:34:01.240
<v Speaker 3>but why is enforced monogamy the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution for people that are involuntary</v>

1971
01:34:01.241 --> 01:34:02.680
<v Speaker 3>celibates?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1972
01:34:02.681 --> 01:34:03.514
<v Speaker 3>it's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the solution to the relationship </v>

1973
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 3>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally is monogamous.</v>

1974
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Social men are unattractive if these on </v>
<v Speaker 3>attraction to them,</v>

1975
01:34:12.670 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 3>but if these men are on attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1976
01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean just physically </v>
<v Speaker 3>unattractive.</v>

1977
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Women aren't just seeking them as mates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to become men.</v>

1978
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they certainly do have the solution.</v>

1979
01:34:22.931 --> 01:34:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that's the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1980
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:25.143
<v Speaker 3>We both agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they need to do that in a society </v>

1981
01:34:27.431 --> 01:34:31.060
<v Speaker 3>where monogamy is the social norm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social norm anyway.</v>

1982
01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was partly my point,</v>

1983
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:36.790
<v Speaker 3>although to the degree that we deviate </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that,</v>

1984
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.930
<v Speaker 3>we tilt towards a more violent society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was making a very minor point.</v>

1985
01:34:40.931 --> 01:34:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're related quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>

1986
01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:43.594
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that involuntary celibates</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that having enforced </v>

1987
01:34:48.181 --> 01:34:51.610
<v Speaker 3>monogamy as a part of our cultural norm </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to help those people.</v>

1988
01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's it going to help them?</v>

1989
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:54.423
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is if a polygamous </v>

1990
01:34:55.601 --> 01:34:56.680
<v Speaker 3>society develops,</v>

1991
01:34:57.050 --> 01:35:00.050
<v Speaker 5>which is the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then a small minority of men get all the</v>

1992
01:35:00.051 --> 01:35:01.640
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happens.</v>

1993
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.310
<v Speaker 5>That's the only point is make his theory</v>
<v Speaker 5>theoretical</v>

1994
01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:11.330
<v Speaker 2>goal world where polygamous societies </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and mass and then you do have this</v>

1995
01:35:13.121 --> 01:35:16.300
<v Speaker 2>problem with is a small group of men </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are fucking all the women,</v>

1996
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:17.520
<v Speaker 2>but that's not.</v>

1997
01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.650
<v Speaker 5>Or talking and also making the women </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhappy.</v>

1998
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:20.533
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the women don't have any access </v>

1999
01:35:21.721 --> 01:35:22.554
<v Speaker 5>to a genuine intimate one to one </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship over any long period of </v>

2000
01:35:25.201 --> 01:35:25.700
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2001
01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.533
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole idea and what's best </v>

2002
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.740
<v Speaker 2>women that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2003
01:35:30.741 --> 01:35:31.890
<v Speaker 2>If you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2004
01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.713
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't think that that is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men are involuntary celibates and </v>

2005
01:35:37.101 --> 01:35:37.934
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the solution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the solution is that they need </v>

2006
01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:41.570
<v Speaker 2>to become attractive.</v>

2007
01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.880
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the solution.</v>

2008
01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:43.621
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2009
01:35:43.621 --> 01:35:45.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the two are related.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2010
01:35:45.341 --> 01:35:47.500
<v Speaker 5>the only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was making a minor point.</v>

2011
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:48.543
<v Speaker 5>The minor point was that one of the ways</v>
<v Speaker 5>that societies around the world have </v>

2012
01:35:51.611 --> 01:35:55.930
<v Speaker 5>figured out that you keep young male </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggression under control is by enforcing</v>

2013
01:35:55.931 --> 01:35:59.380
<v Speaker 5>monogamous standards because it gives </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone a chance in some sense.</v>

2014
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 5>That's the only point that out</v>

2015
01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:05.050
<v Speaker 2>meaning it clears more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2016
01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.513
<v Speaker 2>more women will be available for one on </v>
<v Speaker 2>one relationships rather than one guy </v>

2017
01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.610
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2018
01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.010
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>

2019
01:36:17.011 --> 01:36:17.844
<v Speaker 5>so figure in society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see this happening in universities </v>

2020
01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:21.704
<v Speaker 5>where women outnumber men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the man hypothetically have more </v>

2021
01:36:24.801 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 5>sexual opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that isn't what happens.</v>

2022
01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:30.470
<v Speaker 5>What happens is that a small minority of</v>
<v Speaker 5>men have all the sexual opportunity.</v>

2023
01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 5>A fairly large minority of men don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The women are unhappy because they can't</v>

2024
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:37.460
<v Speaker 5>find a committed relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's bad for most of the men and the men</v>

2025
01:36:37.461 --> 01:36:39.710
<v Speaker 5>who have all the sexual opportunity get </v>
<v Speaker 5>cynical,</v>

2026
01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:40.953
<v Speaker 2>but isn't this in some ways against your</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole idea of equality of outcome </v>

2027
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:46.323
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about equality of sexual </v>

2028
01:36:47.651 --> 01:36:48.370
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2029
01:36:48.370 --> 01:36:49.203
<v Speaker 2>if these men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a guy james that's dominant </v>

2030
01:36:53.771 --> 01:36:56.200
<v Speaker 2>basketball player that just kicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's ass,</v>

2031
01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.760
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2032
01:36:57.770 --> 01:37:00.460
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who succeeded at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level,</v>

2033
01:37:00.461 --> 01:37:01.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2034
01:37:01.211 --> 01:37:03.460
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be people like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>

2035
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.620
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at finding mates and this is what</v>

2036
01:37:08.621 --> 01:37:11.530
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They enjoy having many mates.</v>

2037
01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 2>They enjoy being yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2038
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.903
<v Speaker 2>but if this is what they enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a man who doesn't want a family </v>

2039
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:24.010
<v Speaker 2>and enjoys dating multiple women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that bad?</v>

2040
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:25.343
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the fundamental reason it's bad </v>

2041
01:37:26.641 --> 01:37:28.500
<v Speaker 5>is because it's bad in the long run for </v>
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>

2042
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:31.110
<v Speaker 5>it's bad for children if he chooses to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have children.</v>

2043
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.173
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that makes sense.</v>

2044
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:33.183
<v Speaker 5>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the fundamental issue as far as </v>

2045
01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:36.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm concerned right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the answer.</v>

2046
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:40.860
<v Speaker 5>Look to give the journalist credit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the point she was making,</v>

2047
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:43.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apart from pillaring me and,</v>

2048
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.820
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2049
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.710
<v Speaker 5>and caricatured my perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the point she was making.</v>

2050
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:47.731
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2051
01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:50.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in favor of unbridled </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies.</v>

2052
01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.750
<v Speaker 5>Like I already said that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2053
01:37:51.751 --> 01:37:52.584
<v Speaker 5>the proclivity of a hierarchy is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the spoils go to the person at top </v>

2054
01:37:55.630 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 5>and that can</v>

2055
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v Speaker 3>destabilize the whole structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have to have a dialogue about how </v>

2056
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:00.890
<v Speaker 3>to rectify that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how</v>

2057
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:02.063
<v Speaker 2>possibly rectified that if one man is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like say if we've got one six foot </v>

2058
01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:12.921
<v Speaker 2>five beautiful man who's got a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and the brilliant and he just wants</v>

2059
01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:14.094
<v Speaker 2>to date a bunch of women and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the people or five foot one and </v>

2060
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 2>they're fat and they're lazy and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is gonna.</v>

2061
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 2>If this is the competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win.</v>

2062
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap.</v>

2063
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:29.811
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around this and even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you decide to have enforced monogamy and</v>

2064
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.273
<v Speaker 2>blair becomes a popular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women are going to be more drawn to </v>

2065
01:38:34.771 --> 01:38:36.330
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he chooses to date them,</v>

2066
01:38:36.331 --> 01:38:37.164
<v Speaker 2>they might decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have him sometimes the </v>

2067
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:43.680
<v Speaker 2>never actually what does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is wrong with that?</v>

2068
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:44.993
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong wIth it is that it </v>

2069
01:38:46.331 --> 01:38:48.700
<v Speaker 2>destabilized the society and it's bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>for children.</v>

2070
01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.030
<v Speaker 2>You said that would have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

2071
01:38:52.031 --> 01:38:53.920
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have children.</v>

2072
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.903
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that choose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go their entire life without having </v>

2073
01:38:56.891 --> 01:39:00.820
<v Speaker 2>children as men in their thirties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my friends I've vasectomies they</v>

2074
01:39:00.821 --> 01:39:03.670
<v Speaker 2>don't want children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why?</v>

2075
01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Why would that help in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These involuntary celibate?</v>

2076
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.883
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you tilt the society so that it </v>

2077
01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.340
<v Speaker 3>serves the interests of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2078
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:14.803
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see my point where I see your </v>

2079
01:39:17.571 --> 01:39:18.830
<v Speaker 3>point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>

2080
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.903
<v Speaker 2>You're almost having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're almost forcing in inning in an </v>

2081
01:39:22.601 --> 01:39:23.434
<v Speaker 2>equality of outcome.</v>

2082
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:27.340
<v Speaker 3>I know that was her point to to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree that she had a point that was her</v>

2083
01:39:27.341 --> 01:39:28.174
<v Speaker 3>point now and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't run contrary to my opinions </v>

2084
01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.530
<v Speaker 3>that the issue of outcome has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed.</v>

2085
01:39:35.531 --> 01:39:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Already saId there's needs to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason for the left and the right,</v>

2086
01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.113
<v Speaker 3>and then the problem with hierarchies is</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get to steep and destabilize </v>

2087
01:39:42.521 --> 01:39:43.354
<v Speaker 3>everything that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That particularly happens in the sexual </v>

2088
01:39:45.821 --> 01:39:48.400
<v Speaker 3>domain and there's plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropological evidence for that,</v>

2089
01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.170
<v Speaker 3>but you still might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2090
01:39:50.171 --> 01:39:51.004
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the man who are who are winning </v>

2091
01:39:53.111 --> 01:39:55.300
<v Speaker 3>should be allowed to win in the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be allowed to choose.</v>

2092
01:39:55.630 --> 01:39:56.463
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that there's the problem of </v>

2093
01:39:58.301 --> 01:40:02.200
<v Speaker 3>children and so society steps in on </v>
<v Speaker 3>behalf of the children and you can say,</v>

2094
01:40:02.201 --> 01:40:03.034
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of people don't want to have </v>

2095
01:40:03.611 --> 01:40:05.020
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2096
01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:05.943
<v Speaker 3>and that's truer now than it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although many of those people end up </v>

2097
01:40:08.351 --> 01:40:09.184
<v Speaker 3>having children anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the guys who snooping around </v>

2098
01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.390
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that doesn't circumvent the problem,</v>

2099
01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.820
<v Speaker 3>but the issue here for me isn't the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the women,</v>

2100
01:40:15.821 --> 01:40:16.654
<v Speaker 3>it's the children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to set up societies where </v>

2101
01:40:19.210 --> 01:40:20.043
<v Speaker 3>the probability that children will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised in something approximating </v>

2102
01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.253
<v Speaker 3>optimal environment is optimized and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to mean sacrifice of </v>

2103
01:40:25.961 --> 01:40:27.850
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and choice on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the adults</v>

2104
01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.390
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

2105
01:40:30.391 --> 01:40:31.224
<v Speaker 2>but I think the what we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>mirrors what we're talking about in </v>

2106
01:40:33.871 --> 01:40:34.704
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It mirrors what we're talking about in </v>

2107
01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everything else.</v>

2108
01:40:37.801 --> 01:40:38.634
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at all different aspects of life </v>

2109
01:40:42.321 --> 01:40:45.810
<v Speaker 2>is going to be people that are talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like getting women to.</v>

2110
01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>

2111
01:40:47.391 --> 01:40:49.280
<v Speaker 3>but that's why also look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see this,</v>

2112
01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.473
<v Speaker 3>women are hypergo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they made up and they meet </v>

2113
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:56.650
<v Speaker 3>and up dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if you're a male who's successful</v>

2114
01:40:56.651 --> 01:40:57.484
<v Speaker 3>in a given hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you're going to </v>

2115
01:40:58.721 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 3>have additional mating opportunities is </v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptionally high.</v>

2116
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.570
<v Speaker 3>It's an unbelievably good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2117
01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:07.600
<v Speaker 3>That high is a very uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>

2118
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.510
<v Speaker 3>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2119
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.670
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions too.</v>

2120
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.513
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the idea that it defines women's </v>

2121
01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:18.190
<v Speaker 3>sexual choices by the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want beggar bigger,</v>

2122
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:20.300
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's more,</v>

2123
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.333
<v Speaker 3>more successful than someone is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher on the social ladder than what </v>

2124
01:41:26.051 --> 01:41:26.884
<v Speaker 3>they're accustomed to or what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What women do is like make choices is a </v>

2125
01:41:29.771 --> 01:41:32.130
<v Speaker 3>very difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do you solve that?</v>

2126
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how women solve it.</v>

2127
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Throw them in a ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them compete it.</v>

2128
01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Whatever they're competing at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assume that the man who wins is the best</v>

2129
01:41:38.681 --> 01:41:39.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marry him.</v>

2130
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a brilliant solution.</v>

2131
01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.053
<v Speaker 3>It's a market oriented solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the solution that appears </v>

2132
01:41:45.821 --> 01:41:48.550
<v Speaker 3>to have driven our evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>departure from chimpanzees.</v>

2133
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a biological solution solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>which has a cost.</v>

2134
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.800
<v Speaker 3>What is the cost?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2135
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.713
<v Speaker 3>the cost is the cost is polygamy and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we ran that in within forest monogamy </v>

2136
01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.220
<v Speaker 3>and we do that in order to provide </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable,</v>

2137
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 3>stable circumstances for children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is polyamorous,</v>

2138
01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:12.180
<v Speaker 3>polyamorous society just as unattainable</v>
<v Speaker 3>as this utopian marxist idea?</v>

2139
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.633
<v Speaker 3>I think so because it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another point I was making </v>

2140
01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.630
<v Speaker 3>that didn't get covered in the article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about it somewhat extensively on</v>

2141
01:42:22.631 --> 01:42:23.464
<v Speaker 3>my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that society's tilt towards monogamy </v>

2142
01:42:26.831 --> 01:42:27.664
<v Speaker 3>across the world is human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean that people don't </v>

2143
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 3>have polygamous or polyamorous </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendencies because they certainly do and</v>

2144
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:35.164
<v Speaker 3>it certainly also the case that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways that women gerrymander this </v>

2145
01:42:37.661 --> 01:42:38.494
<v Speaker 3>system is that the number of women and </v>
<v Speaker 3>children who are in a say say you're </v>

2146
01:42:44.681 --> 01:42:47.170
<v Speaker 3>married and you have children with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>husband,</v>

2147
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:51.700
<v Speaker 3>but you also have an affair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have a child by another mat that's</v>

2148
01:42:51.701 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 3>more common than anyone suspected.</v>

2149
01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:54.543
<v Speaker 3>So part of their weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weigh that women solve the problem </v>

2150
01:42:56.321 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that you're just describing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

2151
01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying anything for this or </v>
<v Speaker 3>against this,</v>

2152
01:43:00.461 --> 01:43:02.770
<v Speaker 3>this is a purely factual biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>claim,</v>

2153
01:43:03.190 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 3>is they pick a monogamous marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cheat with high status guys.</v>

2154
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.553
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously in the confines of the </v>

2155
01:43:09.761 --> 01:43:11.140
<v Speaker 3>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible thing,</v>

2156
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:12.423
<v Speaker 3>but that's a very uncomfortable subject </v>
<v Speaker 3>though for women and protecting her </v>

2157
01:43:15.901 --> 01:43:16.734
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable subject for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a terribly uncomfortable </v>

2158
01:43:19.361 --> 01:43:20.194
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like the idea that this is a </v>

2159
01:43:21.851 --> 01:43:22.684
<v Speaker 3>common thing that women choose a safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>man that is willing to be monogamous </v>

2160
01:43:27.071 --> 01:43:27.904
<v Speaker 3>with them and perhaps maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>above him in a social class or in a </v>

2161
01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:36.930
<v Speaker 3>sexually and then they'll cheat with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who was taught.</v>

2162
01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.860
<v Speaker 3>It's common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the norm,</v>

2163
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:41.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still the norm not to do that.</v>

2164
01:43:41.051 --> 01:43:42.910
<v Speaker 3>The norm is fidelity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2165
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 3>but there's plenty of exception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is enforced monogamy,</v>

2166
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:46.833
<v Speaker 3>culturally the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the very definition of monogamy </v>

2167
01:43:49.301 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 3>is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2168
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my son's married</v>

2169
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.903
<v Speaker 4>in september and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say he comes to me in a year </v>

2170
01:43:55.761 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey dad,</v>

2171
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.464
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had three affairs in the last year </v>

2172
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 4>and they've all been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't got caught,</v>

2173
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 4>aren't I a good guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I going to say to that?</v>

2174
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:05.503
<v Speaker 4>Know what the hell are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not what you're supposed to be </v>

2175
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's enforced monogamy</v>

2176
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:11.893
<v Speaker 2>enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Origami meaning the people around you </v>

2177
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:17.870
<v Speaker 2>try to guide them in a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is going to lose it's harmonious.</v>

2178
01:44:18.250 --> 01:44:19.083
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's built deep into the cultural norms </v>

2179
01:44:20.261 --> 01:44:21.094
<v Speaker 4>and if that starts to destabilize them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's trouble and that doesn't mean </v>

2180
01:44:24.251 --> 01:44:27.460
<v Speaker 4>that it's not prone to all the problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you laid out.</v>

2181
01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:28.294
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there isn't a bigger problem than </v>

2182
01:44:29.921 --> 01:44:30.754
<v Speaker 4>successful reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is the big problem and all of the </v>

2183
01:44:34.691 --> 01:44:38.500
<v Speaker 4>solutions that we've generated for it </v>
<v Speaker 4>are full of flaws.</v>

2184
01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:41.020
<v Speaker 4>Like here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gender paY gap,</v>

2185
01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.150
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no gender pay gap.</v>

2186
01:44:43.151 --> 01:44:45.280
<v Speaker 4>There's a mother gap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's other reasons too,</v>

2187
01:44:45.281 --> 01:44:47.830
<v Speaker 4>but women really take a hit when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>become mothers.</v>

2188
01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's unfair.</v>

2189
01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2190
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:52.520
<v Speaker 4>What the hell are you going to do</v>

2191
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:53.780
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that though,</v>

2192
01:44:53.781 --> 01:44:55.160
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what also,</v>

2193
01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.433
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to interrupt you here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what's one of the things </v>

2194
01:44:58.221 --> 01:45:00.830
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted to bring up but are kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of lost track of it.</v>

2195
01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:02.443
<v Speaker 2>The misrepresentation of view mirrors </v>
<v Speaker 2>the misrepresentation of the gender pay </v>

2196
01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:06.344
<v Speaker 2>gap because it's a convenient </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresentation that upon further </v>

2197
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 2>inspection and understanding you realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no gender pay gap,</v>

2198
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:16.730
<v Speaker 2>the gender pay gap when people discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that don't understand it and I've had</v>

2199
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.930
<v Speaker 2>these conversations with really </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people that just listened to</v>

2200
01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:25.550
<v Speaker 2>what's in the news or read some very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick article talking about this problem</v>

2201
01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:29.690
<v Speaker 2>that we have and they assume that a man </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a woman are working the same job,</v>

2202
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 2>but the woman is unfairly paid seventy </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine cents to the man's dollar.</v>

2203
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:36.740
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not close to the case cases.</v>

2204
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Women choose different professions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't pay as much.</v>

2205
01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.963
<v Speaker 2>They work less hours and they oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>get married and have children and </v>

2206
01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.730
<v Speaker 2>because they have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take paternity leave when they make</v>

2207
01:45:46.731 --> 01:45:47.564
<v Speaker 2>less money and they make less money </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that the reasons or 20 reasons </v>

2208
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 2>for the gender pay gap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2209
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.713
<v Speaker 2>One of them being motherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a whole slew of jobs meant </v>

2210
01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 2>work outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are more likely to move,</v>

2211
01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's never discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's discussed.</v>

2212
01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Don't like multivariate problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that it's a.</v>

2213
01:46:04.261 --> 01:46:05.094
<v Speaker 2>It's a willful misrepresentation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and I think it mirrors this </v>

2214
01:46:08.661 --> 01:46:11.090
<v Speaker 2>willful misrepresentation of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2215
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:14.660
<v Speaker 2>where you stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think they're all tied in together</v>

2216
01:46:14.661 --> 01:46:19.100
<v Speaker 2>with people want bad and good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want a one and a zero.</v>

2217
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:20.780
<v Speaker 2>They want things to be very binary.</v>

2218
01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will not to be binary in the way </v>

2219
01:46:22.631 --> 01:46:23.464
<v Speaker 4>they already understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want everything to fit their </v>

2220
01:46:25.091 --> 01:46:27.760
<v Speaker 4>ideological lens and things are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated than that.</v>

2221
01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.713
<v Speaker 2>This is a complex discussion that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to get in a five minute </v>

2222
01:46:32.651 --> 01:46:34.110
<v Speaker 2>segment on a talk show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2223
01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not going to get this on a radio show.</v>

2224
01:46:36.401 --> 01:46:39.580
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get this in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>article that gets edited by someone with</v>

2225
01:46:39.581 --> 01:46:40.414
<v Speaker 2>a biased opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the problem with mainstream </v>

2226
01:46:43.241 --> 01:46:45.370
<v Speaker 2>media and this is the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

2227
01:46:45.371 --> 01:46:47.290
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warren farrell's book on,</v>

2228
01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:49.950
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book called warren is the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's</v>

2229
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:50.813
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it most pilloried </v>

2230
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:53.154
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pointing out the real reasons for the </v>

2231
01:46:53.881 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 4>gender pay gap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote a book called why men make more</v>

2232
01:46:57.130 --> 01:47:00.270
<v Speaker 4>hoody rated for his daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2233
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Because he wanted to help provide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now obviously he was doing it for public</v>

2234
01:47:03.991 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 4>consumption as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the motivations was,</v>

2235
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men do make more.</v>

2236
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Well why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if women want to make more,</v>

2237
01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 4>what could they learn from the men who </v>
<v Speaker 4>make more how to make more?</v>

2238
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:13.944
<v Speaker 4>And the answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question is whether or not they'll </v>

2239
01:47:15.421 --> 01:47:16.254
<v Speaker 4>do it and the book the probable answers </v>
<v Speaker 4>most women won't because how much you </v>

2240
01:47:19.831 --> 01:47:22.860
<v Speaker 4>make isn't the only hallmark of success </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your life.</v>

2241
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:24.293
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>iT's like it's one measure and it might </v>

2242
01:47:26.191 --> 01:47:29.190
<v Speaker 4>be a measure that really competitive men</v>
<v Speaker 4>compete for and they do.</v>

2243
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:31.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's partly to provide access to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2244
01:47:32.050 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to increase mating opportunities because</v>

2245
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:35.790
<v Speaker 4>that's built into the structure.</v>

2246
01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Something we never talk about either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although we could.</v>

2247
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:42.870
<v Speaker 4>So warren wrote this to lay out all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons that men make more,</v>

2248
01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:43.704
<v Speaker 4>but it was so that his daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part so that his daughters </v>

2249
01:47:45.901 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 4>could figure out how to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>socioeconomically successful.</v>

2250
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:48.751
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2251
01:47:48.751 --> 01:47:49.584
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the only hallmark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much socioeconomic success are you </v>

2252
01:47:51.991 --> 01:47:52.824
<v Speaker 4>willing to sacrifice to spend time with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids before they're three years </v>

2253
01:47:54.691 --> 01:47:55.800
<v Speaker 4>old?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2254
01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:58.410
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that shouldn't be none,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2255
01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Because what makes it look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we already know this for,</v>

2256
01:48:00.581 --> 01:48:01.414
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you make enough money to keep the </v>

2257
01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:04.224
<v Speaker 4>bill collectors at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kinda lower upper working </v>

2258
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:09.200
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say something like,</v>

2259
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:12.390
<v Speaker 4>even centrist working class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep the bill collectors at bay.</v>

2260
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 4>Additional money doesn't improve your </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality of life.</v>

2261
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.173
<v Speaker 4>Other things do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe it's a rational response when </v>

2262
01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you're like 30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the irrational men.</v>

2263
01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Here's the irrational man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they drive the world,</v>

2264
01:48:26.401 --> 01:48:29.910
<v Speaker 4>but they're the irrational men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More success is always better.</v>

2265
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:31.013
<v Speaker 4>Along this unit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dimensional axis of achievement wasn't </v>

2266
01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 4>gecko.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greed is good.</v>

2267
01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a tiny percentage of men who are</v>

2268
01:48:37.921 --> 01:48:41.250
<v Speaker 4>hyper competitive along those single </v>
<v Speaker 4>axis of,</v>

2269
01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.660
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of competition,</v>

2270
01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 4>and maybe they drive most things they </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably do,</v>

2271
01:48:46.410 --> 01:48:47.243
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't make them right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also doesn't make them most people </v>

2272
01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't make them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2273
01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:52.554
<v Speaker 4>happy is a whole different issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they're out of it </v>

2274
01:48:54.451 --> 01:48:58.170
<v Speaker 4>because everyone is well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are though in in pursuit of success,</v>

2275
01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 4>it's implied that happiness goes with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that success.</v>

2276
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.400
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the fuck are you doing?</v>

2277
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:04.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well dominic domination,</v>

2278
01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:07.440
<v Speaker 4>power back actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's charisma.</v>

2279
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:08.274
<v Speaker 4>Prestige while he applied it is success </v>
<v Speaker 4>and happiness or an extra bleak </v>

2280
01:49:12.631 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 4>connected in our perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:49:15.241 --> 01:49:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's often a flawed equation,</v>

2282
01:49:17.690 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what happens.</v>

2283
01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I workEd in law firms with law firms for</v>

2284
01:49:21.931 --> 01:49:24.810
<v Speaker 4>a very long period of time and I worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>for lots of high end women,</v>

2285
01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:28.530
<v Speaker 4>lots of and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were usually extremely attractive.</v>

2286
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.900
<v Speaker 4>They were extremely intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were extremely driven.</v>

2287
01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:32.550
<v Speaker 4>They were very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very conscientious.</v>

2288
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:34.860
<v Speaker 4>They varied in how agreeable they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere.</v>

2289
01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:37.560
<v Speaker 4>Disagreeable litigator types in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some were more agreeable.</v>

2290
01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 4>They often had a harder time in the law </v>
<v Speaker 4>firms,</v>

2291
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 4>but the law firms lose all their women </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the thirties.</v>

2292
01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:46.290
<v Speaker 4>They all bail out at partner level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them will say,</v>

2293
01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 4>jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2294
01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:49.283
<v Speaker 4>it's a good percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a huge percentage and it isn't </v>

2295
01:49:51.101 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 4>because of the law firms don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2296
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.990
<v Speaker 4>The law firms want them because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't find people like that.</v>

2297
01:49:55.991 --> 01:49:58.200
<v Speaker 4>They're really rare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're also rainmakers,</v>

2298
01:49:58.210 --> 01:49:59.043
<v Speaker 4>if they can bring in money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the law firms bend themselves over </v>

2299
01:50:00.971 --> 01:50:02.230
<v Speaker 4>backwards trying to keep the women.</v>

2300
01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 4>It can't keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2301
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the women decide that,</v>

2302
01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm working 18 hours a day,</v>

2303
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 4>flat out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven days a week.</v>

2304
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>My husband makes a fair bit of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I made half as much money as I made,</v>

2305
01:50:15.911 --> 01:50:19.660
<v Speaker 4>we'd still have plenty of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why am I working 18 hours a day?</v>

2306
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the question.</v>

2307
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:26.710
<v Speaker 4>The question is why would anyone work 18</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours a day?</v>

2308
01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.033
<v Speaker 4>that's the mystery and the answer is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>small minority of men are driven to do </v>

2309
01:50:32.061 --> 01:50:34.940
<v Speaker 4>that and so they'll do that no matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you put these guys.</v>

2310
01:50:34.941 --> 01:50:36.680
<v Speaker 4>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2311
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.420
<v Speaker 4>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean it's correct?</v>

2312
01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:40.070
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these women.</v>

2313
01:50:40.071 --> 01:50:42.140
<v Speaker 4>They hit 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've hit partner,</v>

2314
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:43.123
<v Speaker 4>they've hit the pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could keep going if they </v>

2315
01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.130
<v Speaker 4>want him to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they've accomplished their goal.</v>

2316
01:50:47.131 --> 01:50:50.370
<v Speaker 4>They've definitely shown man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're bloody well in the game and they</v>

2317
01:50:50.371 --> 01:50:52.470
<v Speaker 4>wake up at 30 and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2318
01:50:52.471 --> 01:50:55.590
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to have a relationship and also I</v>

2319
01:50:55.591 --> 01:50:56.424
<v Speaker 4>want to have some time to put into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to have kids and I'd actually </v>

2320
01:50:59.191 --> 01:51:01.320
<v Speaker 4>like to see my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2321
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:02.670
<v Speaker 4>is that a rational?</v>

2322
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:06.490
<v Speaker 2>This is another thing that you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in agreement on,</v>

2323
01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:10.390
<v Speaker 2>but when I see people talk about the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you discuss women,</v>

2324
01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:11.253
<v Speaker 2>they misrepresent what you're saying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>paint you in what I think willfully </v>

2325
01:51:17.561 --> 01:51:19.180
<v Speaker 2>paint you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do it on purpose.</v>

2326
01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:20.580
<v Speaker 2>They paint us a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ernest,</v>

2327
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.113
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand if it is because they </v>

2328
01:51:24.881 --> 01:51:25.714
<v Speaker 2>disagree with you on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a convenient way to demonize </v>

2329
01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 2>your position by demonizing you as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being.</v>

2330
01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2331
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.731
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's partly too,</v>

2332
01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:36.640
<v Speaker 4>because I've made the case that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are differences between men and women.</v>

2333
01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:37.533
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like why that isn't a feminist case </v>

2334
01:51:39.271 --> 01:51:40.690
<v Speaker 4>is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2335
01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:42.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're exactly the same.</v>

2336
01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

2337
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2338
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:45.880
<v Speaker 4>And it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's confusing.</v>

2339
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.133
<v Speaker 4>Purposefully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Confusing thing is the data in so look </v>

2340
01:51:51.150 --> 01:51:53.100
<v Speaker 4>and people have accused me of pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

2341
01:51:53.101 --> 01:51:53.934
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I already think is quite comical </v>

2342
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 4>because the studies that I'm reporting </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't.</v>

2343
01:51:57.630 --> 01:51:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Who's accused you of pseudo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh god.</v>

2344
01:51:59.561 --> 01:52:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Journalists of all stripes.</v>

2345
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Especially when I talk about differences</v>
<v Speaker 4>between men and women,</v>

2346
01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:04.721
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2347
01:52:04.721 --> 01:52:05.830
<v Speaker 4>that pseudo science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2348
01:52:05.831 --> 01:52:06.401
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2349
01:52:06.401 --> 01:52:08.110
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bloody mainstream science,</v>

2350
01:52:08.111 --> 01:52:10.720
<v Speaker 4>both biology and psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why do they like to do that?</v>

2351
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:11.883
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it seems to be there's a reason </v>

2352
01:52:13.361 --> 01:52:18.361
<v Speaker 4>that goes along with the radical leftist</v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda that if there are that a world of</v>

2353
01:52:18.981 --> 01:52:22.040
<v Speaker 4>equality of outcome could not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieved and that's the desirable world.</v>

2354
01:52:22.190 --> 01:52:24.410
<v Speaker 4>If there are actually differenceS </v>
<v Speaker 4>between people,</v>

2355
01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:28.550
<v Speaker 4>actual differences like that aren't just</v>
<v Speaker 4>socio culturally constructed so that you</v>

2356
01:52:28.551 --> 01:52:30.620
<v Speaker 4>can gerrymander.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also something as well,</v>

2357
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:31.663
<v Speaker 4>if you're really power mad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to believe that human beings </v>

2358
01:52:34.221 --> 01:52:35.054
<v Speaker 4>are infinitely malleable because then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can mold them in whatever image you </v>

2359
01:52:37.221 --> 01:52:40.160
<v Speaker 4>want and if you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually have a character,</v>

2360
01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:41.173
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something built in then that </v>

2361
01:52:42.381 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 4>interferes with the totalitarian regime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's happened is like,</v>

2362
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got a good personality model.</v>

2363
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 4>We've had it for about 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2364
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 4>The big five model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five dimensions of personality,</v>

2365
01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:54.523
<v Speaker 4>and they were established statistically </v>
<v Speaker 4>a theoretically by left-leaning </v>

2366
01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.490
<v Speaker 4>psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2367
01:52:58.491 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological contaminated,</v>

2368
01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.593
<v Speaker 4>but what I am saying is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence whatsoever that right wing </v>

2369
01:53:05.331 --> 01:53:06.164
<v Speaker 4>leaning psychologists produced the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>five because there are no right leading </v>

2370
01:53:09.261 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So enough of that,</v>

2371
01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 4>that isn't why the big five came up.</v>

2372
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:14.203
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So once you have a good personality </v>

2373
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:15.861
<v Speaker 4>model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>

2374
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:16.694
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we'll do men and women differ and </v>

2375
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 4>the answer is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out they do.</v>

2376
01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.153
<v Speaker 4>There's quite a few differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the biggest ones are women are more </v>

2377
01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:26.000
<v Speaker 4>agreeable because that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traits,</v>

2378
01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:26.834
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness and it's the compassion </v>
<v Speaker 4>politeness dimension and they're more </v>

2379
01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:33.080
<v Speaker 4>prone to negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and emotional pain.</v>

2380
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.213
<v Speaker 4>And that mirrors the psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature that shows worldwide that </v>

2381
01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:39.830
<v Speaker 4>women are more likely to be diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 4>with depression and anxiety,</v>

2382
01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:43.580
<v Speaker 4>just like men are more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>imprisoned for antisocial behavior,</v>

2383
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:45.490
<v Speaker 4>which is the reflection of low </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeable.</v>

2384
01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:48.350
<v Speaker 4>This is true worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

2385
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:49.184
<v Speaker 4>So there's no evidence of any bias </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you say everything is biased </v>

2386
01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:54.200
<v Speaker 4>everywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fine could be.</v>

2387
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 4>But we've also controlled for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now there are personality differences</v>

2388
01:53:58.851 --> 01:53:59.684
<v Speaker 4>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the first thing we might point out </v>

2389
01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:02.540
<v Speaker 4>is they're not that big.</v>

2390
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:07.040
<v Speaker 4>So if you draw a random woman and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>random man out of the population and you</v>

2391
01:54:07.041 --> 01:54:09.830
<v Speaker 4>had to bet on who was most aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>least agreeable,</v>

2392
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:13.730
<v Speaker 4>and you bet on the woman you'd be right </v>
<v Speaker 4>40 percent of the time,</v>

2393
01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.670
<v Speaker 4>which is actually quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be right quite a lot.</v>

2394
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:21.110
<v Speaker 4>But if you take the one in a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who's most aggressive,</v>

2395
01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.520
<v Speaker 4>least agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an overwhelming probability that</v>

2396
01:54:25.521 --> 01:54:29.240
<v Speaker 4>there'll be mailed because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences get more extreme at the,</v>

2397
01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 4>at the ends of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't understand the statistics.</v>

2398
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.823
<v Speaker 4>you can have two populations that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite similar and still have radically </v>

2399
01:54:36.651 --> 01:54:39.530
<v Speaker 4>dissimilar outcomes if only the extremes</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

2400
01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 4>So like who are the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical fighters in the world?</v>

2401
01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>

2402
01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:48.793
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That there are no women who can beat a </v>

2403
01:54:50.331 --> 01:54:51.980
<v Speaker 4>man in a fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2404
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:53.990
<v Speaker 4>it also doesn't mean that there are.</v>

2405
01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of women who are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive than men,</v>

2406
01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:00.470
<v Speaker 4>but if you take the most aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physically powerful people,</v>

2407
01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.693
<v Speaker 4>they're all men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them because they're like one in </v>

2408
01:55:03.421 --> 01:55:05.900
<v Speaker 4>a thousand people or one in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2409
01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 4>So you can have walloping differences at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the extremes,</v>

2410
01:55:08.661 --> 01:55:10.970
<v Speaker 4>despite most most similarity at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>

2411
01:55:11.090 --> 01:55:13.520
<v Speaker 4>People don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the next thing is,</v>

2412
01:55:13.521 --> 01:55:14.354
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there are differences between men </v>

2413
01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:18.050
<v Speaker 4>and women personality wise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from the biological ones.</v>

2414
01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Are those caused by cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences?</v>

2415
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turns out we can answer that.</v>

2416
01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:25.063
<v Speaker 4>How rank order countries by how </v>
<v Speaker 4>egalitarianism their social policies </v>

2417
01:55:29.871 --> 01:55:31.730
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does everyone agree?</v>

2418
01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:35.990
<v Speaker 4>The scandinavians are at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone agrees,</v>

2420
01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:36.831
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2421
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone agrees.</v>

2422
01:55:38.690 --> 01:55:39.171
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2423
01:55:39.171 --> 01:55:42.800
<v Speaker 4>so you stack up the cultures by how </v>
<v Speaker 4>egalitarianism social policies are,</v>

2424
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:47.310
<v Speaker 4>and then you look to see how big the </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences are between men and women up</v>

2425
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 4>that hierarchy of egalitarianism.</v>

2426
01:55:49.590 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 4>And if as the societies become more </v>
<v Speaker 4>egalitarian,</v>

2427
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:55.560
<v Speaker 4>the differences between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappear,</v>

2428
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.760
<v Speaker 4>then it's sociocultural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That isn't what happened.</v>

2429
01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.970
<v Speaker 4>What happened was is that as the has got</v>
<v Speaker 4>more egalitarian,</v>

2430
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 4>the differences between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 4>got bigger,</v>

2431
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:08.783
<v Speaker 4>not smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means the sociocultural construct </v>

2432
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:13.110
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm talking to you,</v>

2433
01:56:13.111 --> 01:56:15.930
<v Speaker 4>sociocultural construct people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wrong.</v>

2434
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.130
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You make the society's more egalitarian.</v>

2435
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:21.113
<v Speaker 4>Men and women get more different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who makes the argument in opposition of </v>

2436
01:56:23.911 --> 01:56:24.631
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

2437
01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:25.464
<v Speaker 4>all of the social constructionist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the radical left wingers and what </v>

2438
01:56:27.421 --> 01:56:29.250
<v Speaker 4>are the uses fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have facts,</v>

2439
01:56:29.251 --> 01:56:31.320
<v Speaker 4>but then they criticize the whole idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>of facts.</v>

2440
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 4>Then they go after the whole idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>science as a,</v>

2441
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:36.690
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a western patriarchal construct.</v>

2442
01:56:36.691 --> 01:56:37.524
<v Speaker 4>What's their motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The motivation is that if people are </v>

2443
01:56:40.591 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 4>different than the equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't,</v>

2444
01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.950
<v Speaker 4>is neither desirable nor achievable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>why do they want equality of outcome?</v>

2445
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:49.490
<v Speaker 4>Why is this so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

2446
01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:50.433
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it is part of it is actual </v>

2447
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:52.900
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look around.</v>

2448
01:56:53.410 --> 01:56:58.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not good that some people lose and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly not good that some losers</v>

2449
01:56:58.561 --> 01:57:00.570
<v Speaker 4>lose all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who wants that?</v>

2450
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.940
<v Speaker 4>You happy when you walk down the street </v>
<v Speaker 4>and see homeless people.</v>

2451
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.541
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2452
01:57:03.541 --> 01:57:04.890
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchies working.</v>

2453
01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Look at these homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's happy about that.</v>

2454
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:08.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2455
01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:09.444
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact of failure within a </v>

2456
01:57:11.161 --> 01:57:15.510
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy of value is painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so to give the devil his due,</v>

2457
01:57:15.511 --> 01:57:17.150
<v Speaker 4>you give the left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's due just like you.</v>

2458
01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:19.200
<v Speaker 4>You do the right is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2459
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:21.510
<v Speaker 4>it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That hierarchies produced dispossession.</v>

2460
01:57:21.690 --> 01:57:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Bloody right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2461
01:57:22.831 --> 01:57:24.720
<v Speaker 4>What's the cure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of the hierarchy.</v>

2462
01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well wait a minute,</v>

2463
01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:27.630
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get rid of the hierarchy.</v>

2464
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:28.464
<v Speaker 4>You get rid of the value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get rid of the tools that allow us </v>

2465
01:57:30.871 --> 01:57:33.900
<v Speaker 4>to generate absolute wealth and stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>people from starving.</v>

2466
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.550
<v Speaker 4>It's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2467
01:57:35.551 --> 01:57:36.310
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's.</v>

2468
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 4>There's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have the hierarchy,</v>

2469
01:57:37.831 --> 01:57:40.920
<v Speaker 4>but then also it isn't just compassion </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the left.</v>

2470
01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:44.100
<v Speaker 4>It's envy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2471
01:57:44.101 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm.</v>

2472
01:57:45.841 --> 01:57:46.674
<v Speaker 4>So if I'm standing for the dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes me so sure that I'm not just </v>

2473
01:57:50.761 --> 01:57:51.594
<v Speaker 4>standing against the successful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's because I'm bitter and </v>

2474
01:57:54.091 --> 01:57:58.110
<v Speaker 4>jealous and envious and resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly it's highly probable.</v>

2475
01:57:58.111 --> 01:57:58.944
<v Speaker 4>If you look at what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>leftist societies that tried to pursue </v>

2476
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:05.070
<v Speaker 4>utopia and you don't read envy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentment into that,</v>

2477
01:58:05.071 --> 01:58:05.904
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know the history because </v>

2478
01:58:06.901 --> 01:58:09.390
<v Speaker 4>that's clearly the why else did they </v>
<v Speaker 4>become murderous,</v>

2479
01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:13.950
<v Speaker 4>but this is the question like it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly the case that the soviet union,</v>

2480
01:58:13.951 --> 01:58:17.400
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was motivated by the desire for equality</v>

2481
01:58:17.401 --> 01:58:20.490
<v Speaker 4>of outcome as a primary motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

2482
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Twenty 5 million people were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2483
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.863
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it all compassion and love for </v>

2484
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:28.374
<v Speaker 4>the dispossessed or was it absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter resentment and hatred for anyone </v>

2485
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:37.140
<v Speaker 4>who had any shred of success whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 4>on any possible dimension of evaluation.</v>

2486
01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:38.243
<v Speaker 4>so this compassion for people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't doing well when utilized the </v>

2487
01:58:43.331 --> 01:58:44.164
<v Speaker 4>wrong way or when approached the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>way leads to attacking people that do </v>

2488
01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:51.460
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The danger of compassion.</v>

2489
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.360
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2490
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 4>look what happens if you get beat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

2491
01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:55.323
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at how isn't it lovely that the </v>

2492
01:58:56.351 --> 01:58:58.270
<v Speaker 4>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bear takes care of her cubs?</v>

2493
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:59.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's lovely bad until you get between </v>

2494
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:03.850
<v Speaker 4>her and her cubs and it's not so damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>lovely,</v>

2495
01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:06.850
<v Speaker 4>and that's the flip side of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>affiliate of agreeableness.</v>

2496
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:10.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're on my side,</v>

2497
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're the infant who's sheltering </v>

2498
01:59:13.091 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 4>under my wings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I am.</v>

2499
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:18.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm the absolute epitome of of maternal </v>
<v Speaker 4>love and care,</v>

2500
01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.800
<v Speaker 4>but if I have identified you as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>predator,</v>

2501
01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:21.843
<v Speaker 4>you better look the hell out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing out in our political landscape </v>

2502
01:59:24.791 --> 01:59:26.050
<v Speaker 4>at a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rapid rate.</v>

2503
01:59:26.050 --> 01:59:29.260
<v Speaker 4>That's the female side of </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism as far as I can tell,</v>

2504
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 4>the feminine side of totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that.</v>

2505
01:59:32.381 --> 01:59:33.214
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivates aggression because it </v>

2506
01:59:35.621 --> 01:59:40.120
<v Speaker 4>certainly does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also that it's that the envious and</v>

2507
01:59:40.121 --> 01:59:45.121
<v Speaker 4>the resentful can use compassion as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a camouflage for their true intent,</v>

2508
01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:48.430
<v Speaker 4>which is to tear down anyone who has </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than them.</v>

2509
01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.593
<v Speaker 4>That's the why you noticed like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's discussions about the one </v>

2510
01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:54.190
<v Speaker 4>percent we already talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2511
01:59:54.191 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 4>who's the one percent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While it's.</v>

2512
01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a.</v>

2513
01:59:57.370 --> 01:59:58.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the,</v>

2514
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.863
<v Speaker 4>in the park in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrating against wall street down </v>

2515
02:00:02.561 --> 02:00:03.790
<v Speaker 4>with the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2516
02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:06.550
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the one percent.</v>

2517
02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 4>They are mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Protester.</v>

2518
02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2519
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:13.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't understand the rich are those </v>
<v Speaker 4>who have more money than me guess,</v>

2520
02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the definition.</v>

2521
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Who's rich?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone who has more than me,</v>

2522
02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:17.913
<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>

2523
02:00:18.330 --> 02:00:19.151
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2524
02:00:19.151 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why isn't the one percent north America?</v>

2525
02:00:22.810 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's inconvenient.</v>

2526
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:28.510
<v Speaker 4>That's an inconvenient fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's part of it,</v>

2527
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 4>but there's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The envy and resentment.</v>

2528
02:00:31.690 --> 02:00:32.523
<v Speaker 4>This is the real pathological end of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>full compassion that motivates the </v>

2529
02:00:36.611 --> 02:00:37.720
<v Speaker 4>radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2530
02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:39.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you liked the poor.</v>

2531
02:00:39.101 --> 02:00:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes you think you just don't hate</v>

2532
02:00:41.411 --> 02:00:44.500
<v Speaker 4>the successful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's a question.</v>

2533
02:00:44.501 --> 02:00:46.060
<v Speaker 4>It's like because you're not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2534
02:00:46.061 --> 02:00:49.540
<v Speaker 4>There's hatred in you and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>probability that it's more powerful than</v>

2535
02:00:49.541 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 4>love is pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2536
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 4>so look to your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look to your own viewpoint before you go</v>

2537
02:00:56.861 --> 02:00:58.990
<v Speaker 4>out there and try to fix the hierarchies</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world,</v>

2538
02:00:59.110 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 4>just exactly what it is and it's worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>like look in the russian revolution,</v>

2539
02:01:03.371 --> 02:01:05.560
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say just for the sake of argument,</v>

2540
02:01:06.370 --> 02:01:10.120
<v Speaker 4>that the first rung of revolutionaries </v>
<v Speaker 4>were only driven by compassion.</v>

2541
02:01:11.110 --> 02:01:13.570
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all got killed.</v>

2542
02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:15.333
<v Speaker 4>they got killed by the people who came </v>
<v Speaker 4>after and they weren't so interested in </v>

2543
02:01:17.231 --> 02:01:18.064
<v Speaker 4>compassionate at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were interested in ferreting out </v>

2544
02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:24.960
<v Speaker 4>everyone who had a modicum of success on</v>
<v Speaker 4>any dimension and doing them in and that</v>

2545
02:01:25.181 --> 02:01:30.181
<v Speaker 4>happened in wave after bloody wave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed all the successful farmers.</v>

2546
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.930
<v Speaker 4>Those were the kulaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It killed all of the running up,</v>

2547
02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:35.260
<v Speaker 4>killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rape them,</v>

2548
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:37.920
<v Speaker 4>stolen property,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sent the remnants to siberia,</v>

2549
02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 4>froze them to death 10 years later,</v>

2550
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 3>6 million ukrainians dot because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't raise crops.</v>

2551
02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that people are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to discussing these things or to</v>

2552
02:01:50.211 --> 02:01:51.044
<v Speaker 2>challenging cultural norms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things that I've </v>

2553
02:01:54.170 --> 02:01:55.003
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in terms of the differences </v>

2554
02:01:56.630 --> 02:01:59.640
<v Speaker 2>between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2555
02:01:59.890 --> 02:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>this reaction to some of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've said has been very.</v>

2556
02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:08.053
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange that people aren't </v>

2557
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.520
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that these are unbalanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaches and that there's.</v>

2558
02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's just complicated joe.</v>

2559
02:02:17.281 --> 02:02:17.851
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2560
02:02:17.851 --> 02:02:19.800
<v Speaker 3>let's say there are differences between </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women.</v>

2561
02:02:19.801 --> 02:02:20.634
<v Speaker 3>Just for the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest differences seem to be an </v>

2562
02:02:22.291 --> 02:02:24.900
<v Speaker 3>interest by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what's going to happen is that if</v>

2563
02:02:24.901 --> 02:02:26.640
<v Speaker 3>we let men and women's sort themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2564
02:02:26.970 --> 02:02:27.803
<v Speaker 3>there aren't going to be very many </v>
<v Speaker 3>female engineers and tech types and </v>

2565
02:02:29.641 --> 02:02:31.380
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a lot of female </v>
<v Speaker 3>nurses.</v>

2566
02:02:31.590 --> 02:02:33.930
<v Speaker 3>There's not going to be many male nurses</v>
<v Speaker 3>and healthcare types.</v>

2567
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:37.050
<v Speaker 3>There's not going to be met very many </v>
<v Speaker 3>male elementary school teachers.</v>

2568
02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.370
<v Speaker 3>But Is this bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2569
02:02:38.371 --> 02:02:39.870
<v Speaker 3>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2570
02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:41.670
<v Speaker 3>do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2571
02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of having</v>

2572
02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:48.540
<v Speaker 2>unequal society where gender inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely knocked down,</v>

2573
02:02:48.541 --> 02:02:50.480
<v Speaker 2>gender pay gap is nonexistent.</v>

2574
02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a problem because that's </v>

2575
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:53.800
<v Speaker 3>quality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>

2576
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it's the quality of outcome thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonstarter.</v>

2577
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:58.103
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's okay with like if men and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women sort themselves into different </v>

2578
02:03:01.021 --> 02:03:03.060
<v Speaker 3>occupations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which looks highly probable.</v>

2579
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:06.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's also like,</v>

2580
02:03:06.450 --> 02:03:08.490
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to to what alternative?</v>

2581
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you should every elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher be female,</v>

2582
02:03:12.330 --> 02:03:15.240
<v Speaker 3>should every psychologist be female?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what's happening.</v>

2583
02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:18.010
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't know but.</v>

2584
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:19.350
<v Speaker 3>But there's another answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2585
02:03:20.130 --> 02:03:22.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you propose as an alternative to</v>

2586
02:03:22.771 --> 02:03:27.300
<v Speaker 3>free choice that isn't going to cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>more trouble than free choice?</v>

2587
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:28.231
<v Speaker 3>Because I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2588
02:03:28.231 --> 02:03:30.240
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I'm a feminist for the sake of</v>

2589
02:03:30.241 --> 02:03:31.530
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2590
02:03:31.531 --> 02:03:33.780
<v Speaker 3>So I think while there are differences </v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and women,</v>

2591
02:03:34.130 --> 02:03:37.770
<v Speaker 3>there are actual differences and so some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those are biological,</v>

2592
02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 3>some of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

2593
02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:40.403
<v Speaker 3>are strategic in some sense because </v>
<v Speaker 3>women pay a bigger price for </v>

2594
02:03:43.531 --> 02:03:46.200
<v Speaker 3>reproduction and so that's going to lead</v>
<v Speaker 3>them to make different choices.</v>

2595
02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:48.810
<v Speaker 3>That's just rational based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality,</v>

2596
02:03:48.811 --> 02:03:51.630
<v Speaker 3>based on biological differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a second order.</v>

2597
02:03:51.631 --> 02:03:52.464
<v Speaker 3>Biological difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's differences in temperament and </v>

2598
02:03:54.271 --> 02:03:55.350
<v Speaker 3>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going,</v>

2599
02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:57.090
<v Speaker 3>it's going to lead them to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>different choices.</v>

2600
02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:00.240
<v Speaker 3>Is that a pro feminist stance or an anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminist stance?</v>

2601
02:04:00.570 --> 02:04:01.403
<v Speaker 3>It's only antifeminist if you assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has to be exactly the same and </v>

2602
02:04:03.841 --> 02:04:05.460
<v Speaker 3>the outcomes have to be exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

2603
02:04:06.210 --> 02:04:07.800
<v Speaker 3>if the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your goal is no,</v>

2604
02:04:07.801 --> 02:04:10.860
<v Speaker 3>leave people the hell alone as much as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

2605
02:04:10.861 --> 02:04:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Let them make their own informed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>free choices.</v>

2606
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Then you let the differences manifest </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in the world.</v>

2607
02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:19.770
<v Speaker 3>And you take your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take your knocks because of that.</v>

2608
02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.950
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is this narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>of equality,</v>

2609
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:24.570
<v Speaker 3>the equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2610
02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.453
<v Speaker 3>It's just equality of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just looking at people as we're all </v>

2611
02:04:28.411 --> 02:04:30.210
<v Speaker 3>equal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not just.</v>

2612
02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Some people are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things were equal in terms of our rights</v>

2613
02:04:34.110 --> 02:04:35.980
<v Speaker 3>or equal in terms of the way we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>treat each other.</v>

2614
02:04:36.010 --> 02:04:37.620
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically equal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2615
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:39.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on every other dimension,</v>

2616
02:04:39.751 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 3>we're radically unequal and there's pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

2617
02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:43.104
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

2618
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:46.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem is the pain in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is real.</v>

2619
02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:51.750
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's worse than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain of inequality is the pain of forced</v>

2620
02:04:51.751 --> 02:04:54.630
<v Speaker 3>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not being fascinated about that.</v>

2621
02:04:54.631 --> 02:04:55.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2622
02:04:55.531 --> 02:04:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The iq issue is,</v>

2623
02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.520
<v Speaker 3>is the killer one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

2624
02:04:59.521 --> 02:05:00.354
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2625
02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.373
<v Speaker 3>if you have an iq of less than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be inducted into the american </v>

2626
02:05:04.081 --> 02:05:05.940
<v Speaker 3>military by law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2627
02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:07.163
<v Speaker 3>Because there isn't a damn thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that isn't counterproductive despite </v>

2628
02:05:09.451 --> 02:05:12.150
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the army wants you because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't get enough manpower.</v>

2629
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what they decided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2630
02:05:14.311 --> 02:05:15.144
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're on the low end of the </v>

2631
02:05:15.871 --> 02:05:18.150
<v Speaker 3>cognitive distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>

2632
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Not much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to get worse.</v>

2633
02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

2634
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.320
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we know what to do about it?</v>

2635
02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2636
02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:31.410
<v Speaker 3>And we can have equality of outcome </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst people with lower than 83 iq.</v>

2637
02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>No one's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's advocating for that.</v>

2638
02:05:33.670 --> 02:05:34.890
<v Speaker 3>No one's asking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2639
02:05:34.891 --> 02:05:35.641
<v Speaker 3>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2640
02:05:35.641 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 3>the iq tests aren't valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2641
02:05:37.381 --> 02:05:39.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2642
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:40.463
<v Speaker 3>one of the conversations that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I found to be shocking and it </v>

2643
02:05:43.891 --> 02:05:47.280
<v Speaker 3>started a trend of misquoting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresenting you was uh,</v>

2644
02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:48.114
<v Speaker 3>you did an article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an interview with vice and they use a </v>

2645
02:05:51.121 --> 02:05:51.954
<v Speaker 3>snippet of one of the things you said </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tried to pretend that you had made </v>

2646
02:05:55.141 --> 02:05:58.690
<v Speaker 3>these very curt statements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of them while he was,</v>

2647
02:05:58.890 --> 02:05:59.723
<v Speaker 3>he was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got kind of curt and that was </v>

2648
02:06:00.991 --> 02:06:04.110
<v Speaker 3>probably my strategic error makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the one you're talking about?</v>

2649
02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.390
<v Speaker 3>Makeup and the way people dress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2650
02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:10.200
<v Speaker 3>while I was trying to draw a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2651
02:06:10.230 --> 02:06:11.063
<v Speaker 3>how is he annoying?</v>

2652
02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:15.140
<v Speaker 3>He knew everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew everything well.</v>

2653
02:06:15.150 --> 02:06:17.160
<v Speaker 3>It was just in his attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2654
02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 3>it was challenging you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted.</v>

2655
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:22.080
<v Speaker 3>he wanted this from the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was him.</v>

2656
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Arms crossed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes up.</v>

2657
02:06:24.691 --> 02:06:25.524
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know more than you and be your </v>

2658
02:06:27.601 --> 02:06:28.434
<v Speaker 3>probably that reprehensible person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about and this side job to </v>

2659
02:06:30.511 --> 02:06:33.780
<v Speaker 3>reveal you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was signaling he's left leaning.</v>

2660
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:34.883
<v Speaker 3>He was deciding that what you were doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>was representing the patriarchy or you </v>

2661
02:06:38.181 --> 02:06:39.014
<v Speaker 3>were representing male dominant </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures that he was saying that are </v>

2662
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:45.520
<v Speaker 3>not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:46.413
<v Speaker 3>Well it wasn't accurate assessment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't even that it was left </v>

2664
02:06:48.871 --> 02:06:49.704
<v Speaker 3>leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to reasonable left leaning </v>

2665
02:06:50.941 --> 02:06:53.150
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was built right into his attitude.</v>

2666
02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 3>So it made me a little test here that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>might have been,</v>

2667
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:57.370
<v Speaker 3>which was my strategic error and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2668
02:06:57.371 --> 02:06:58.204
<v Speaker 3>you asked earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why do I get pilloried with some </v>

2669
02:06:59.941 --> 02:07:00.450
<v Speaker 3>regular?</v>

2670
02:07:00.450 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 3>And some of it is probably my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>inadequacy.</v>

2671
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2672
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:09.180
<v Speaker 3>it isn't that I've handled all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities that I've had perfectly,</v>

2673
02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can get hot under the collar.</v>

2674
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:12.264
<v Speaker 3>It's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mistake because the right </v>

2675
02:07:14.490 --> 02:07:15.323
<v Speaker 3>approach in these situations is to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimal necessary force and to allow </v>

2676
02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:19.224
<v Speaker 3>myself to get irritated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say even minorly when I'm faced </v>

2677
02:07:23.491 --> 02:07:26.040
<v Speaker 3>with someone who's doing this is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive,</v>

2678
02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:26.993
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I really need to keep that under </v>

2679
02:07:28.621 --> 02:07:30.400
<v Speaker 3>control and when I do keep it under </v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

2680
02:07:30.401 --> 02:07:33.240
<v Speaker 3>it works better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The makeup one was particularly annoying</v>

2681
02:07:33.241 --> 02:07:35.530
<v Speaker 3>to me because I think it's a valid </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

2682
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:37.710
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2683
02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:39.670
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't put this in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial cut.</v>

2684
02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:40.504
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that women shouldn't be </v>

2685
02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>allowed to wear makeup in the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that explicitly.</v>

2686
02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:47.613
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was why people were so angry when </v>

2687
02:07:48.641 --> 02:07:51.760
<v Speaker 3>they saw the full version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the full version was released.</v>

2688
02:07:51.761 --> 02:07:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Someone leaked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2689
02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.513
<v Speaker 3>Someone who felt like you were being </v>
<v Speaker 3>misrepresented and that the editing was </v>

2690
02:07:57.221 --> 02:07:58.054
<v Speaker 3>unjust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to release it and people were </v>

2691
02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:02.140
<v Speaker 3>absolutely furious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2692
02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the.</v>

2693
02:08:02.770 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I think the vice people actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>released it,</v>

2694
02:08:05.021 --> 02:08:09.130
<v Speaker 3>but other people took the full release </v>
<v Speaker 3>and clipped it with the clip release and</v>

2695
02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:12.940
<v Speaker 3>showed how it was being misrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so okay,</v>

2696
02:08:12.941 --> 02:08:15.490
<v Speaker 3>so the the makeup thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2697
02:08:15.550 --> 02:08:16.180
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2698
02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.560
<v Speaker 3>here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2699
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.053
<v Speaker 3>I make a mistake sometimes in treating </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists like I would treat my </v>

2700
02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:22.234
<v Speaker 3>graduate students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I'm having a conversation with </v>

2701
02:08:24.341 --> 02:08:25.360
<v Speaker 3>my students and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2702
02:08:25.361 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an intellectual exercise,</v>

2703
02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:29.680
<v Speaker 3>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual behavior.</v>

2704
02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:30.573
<v Speaker 3>How do we regulate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the norms around sexual </v>

2705
02:08:32.891 --> 02:08:33.820
<v Speaker 3>behavior in the workplace?</v>

2706
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a question we don't know.</v>

2707
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a bunch of possibilities.</v>

2708
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Possible rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2709
02:08:41.650 --> 02:08:42.850
<v Speaker 3>No flirting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no hugging,</v>

<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>five seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2717
02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:56.913
<v Speaker 3>What if you're having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a woman who's your boss and she's </v>

2718
02:09:00.071 --> 02:09:03.250
<v Speaker 3>asking you questions about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can You look down every five seconds?</v>

2720
02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

2721
02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bad.</v>

2722
02:09:08.351 --> 02:09:10.190
<v Speaker 3>That's such a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2723
02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:11.370
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2724
02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:12.213
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of women that I'm </v>

2725
02:09:13.691 --> 02:09:17.380
<v Speaker 3>friends with that I've never had any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual interest at all,</v>

2726
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 3>and we looked at each other in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you say,</v>

2727
02:09:19.781 --> 02:09:22.360
<v Speaker 3>but you're a potential rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Manifestation.</v>

2728
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Picture,</v>

2729
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.340
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2730
02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:25.420
<v Speaker 3>You get the whole picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2731
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.340
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2732
02:09:27.341 --> 02:09:28.174
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the rules governing sexual </v>

2733
02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:30.820
<v Speaker 3>behavior in the workplace?</v>
<v Speaker 3>OkAy.</v>

2734
02:09:30.821 --> 02:09:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Can you come to work at a negligee no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about boxers?</v>

2735
02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:36.190
<v Speaker 3>If you're a mat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2736
02:09:36.370 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some short skirt.</v>

2737
02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing,</v>

2738
02:09:40.241 --> 02:09:42.150
<v Speaker 3>the devil's in the bloody details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2739
02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2740
02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.350
<v Speaker 3>we can't come to work naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't come to work in boxer shorts.</v>

2741
02:09:47.351 --> 02:09:49.750
<v Speaker 3>You can come to work in a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2742
02:09:49.751 --> 02:09:53.620
<v Speaker 3>so the line is somewhere between boxers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suit.</v>

2743
02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Where exactly is the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2744
02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Can wear shorts while that can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can a woman wear a dress?</v>

2745
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.580
<v Speaker 3>The way that men in professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations,</v>

2746
02:10:06.581 --> 02:10:07.414
<v Speaker 3>the way that men solve this problem was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone wore a uniform and a </v>

2747
02:10:11.981 --> 02:10:12.814
<v Speaker 3>uniform makes you uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you wear it and the uniform </v>

2748
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:20.620
<v Speaker 3>is the suit and it's a derivation of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>military military garb,</v>

2749
02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.210
<v Speaker 3>and so the Idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2750
02:10:22.211 --> 02:10:26.570
<v Speaker 3>we want to get rid of excess diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2751
02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:30.130
<v Speaker 3>In clothing where your damn suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we know you're playing the game and</v>

2752
02:10:30.131 --> 02:10:32.200
<v Speaker 3>we don't have to be distracted by what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing.</v>

2753
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what men did.</v>

2754
02:10:33.711 --> 02:10:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now women come into the workspace.</v>

2755
02:10:35.421 --> 02:10:36.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

2756
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:39.320
<v Speaker 3>what do they do while there's business </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional dress.</v>

2757
02:10:39.321 --> 02:10:41.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some rules around that,</v>

2758
02:10:41.181 --> 02:10:42.590
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what are the rules?</v>

2759
02:10:42.591 --> 02:10:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2760
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.470
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2761
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 3>we're worried about sexual misbehavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the workplace.</v>

2762
02:10:47.961 --> 02:10:49.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't look at someone for more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>five seconds.</v>

2763
02:10:49.791 --> 02:10:51.350
<v Speaker 3>You can't give them a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2764
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 3>what about makeup?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a discussion about makeup?</v>

2765
02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:55.041
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

2766
02:10:55.041 --> 02:10:56.870
<v Speaker 3>we can't have a discussion about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2767
02:10:57.110 --> 02:10:58.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make up sexual signaling.</v>

2768
02:10:59.030 --> 02:11:00.350
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2769
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:03.170
<v Speaker 3>if you're an fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an evolutionary biologist,</v>

2770
02:11:03.171 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 3>the question is makeup sexual signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even a question.</v>

2771
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's what it is.</v>

2772
02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:09.973
<v Speaker 3>That's why the conversation was </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating because he was saying </v>

2773
02:11:11.961 --> 02:11:13.940
<v Speaker 3>because they want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to wear it,</v>

2774
02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:16.750
<v Speaker 3>they want to look good while and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>does that even mean well?</v>

2775
02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.790
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2776
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:20.230
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2777
02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows what that means.</v>

2778
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:24.170
<v Speaker 3>He has to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2779
02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:28.310
<v Speaker 3>he has to say that because in his tribe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to communicate that way.</v>

2780
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.910
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>

2781
02:11:30.970 --> 02:11:32.870
<v Speaker 3>women wear makeup because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look good,</v>

2782
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:33.783
<v Speaker 3>but what do you mean do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's his take or because he's </v>

2783
02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 3>trying to rile you up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're getting riled up right now.</v>

2784
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:41.203
<v Speaker 3>Both as a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of his idea or his job to </v>

2785
02:11:44.181 --> 02:11:45.014
<v Speaker 3>challenge you in some way and it it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very least offer the devil's advocate </v>

2786
02:11:48.501 --> 02:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2787
02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Explain yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't they wear makeup?</v>

2788
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:54.080
<v Speaker 3>They just want to look good.</v>

2789
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.440
<v Speaker 3>You need to explain yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you saying he did it was like,</v>

2790
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:58.460
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

2791
02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.293
<v Speaker 3>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious what it means for them to </v>

2792
02:12:00.081 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 3>look good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone knows that.</v>

2793
02:12:02.061 --> 02:12:02.894
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't know it like perhaps like he </v>

2794
02:12:04.641 --> 02:12:08.780
<v Speaker 3>was intellectually sparring with you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was being aggressive about it.</v>

2795
02:12:09.650 --> 02:12:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I think he felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he felt that.</v>

2796
02:12:11.811 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 3>I think he felt that it was necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge me that that was his role as a</v>

2797
02:12:15.531 --> 02:12:18.050
<v Speaker 3>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fundamentally he was smug.</v>

2798
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:22.070
<v Speaker 3>He thought he came at the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with an air of intellectual</v>

2799
02:12:22.071 --> 02:12:22.904
<v Speaker 3>condescension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was built right into the discussion </v>

2800
02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:26.440
<v Speaker 3>right from the beginning and he never </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped it at all.</v>

2801
02:12:26.441 --> 02:12:27.201
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2802
02:12:27.201 --> 02:12:28.034
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up and I know how to take you </v>

2803
02:12:30.651 --> 02:12:31.484
<v Speaker 3>apart and I know that whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about is just an attempt to </v>

2804
02:12:33.861 --> 02:12:35.580
<v Speaker 3>defend your how long indians?</v>

2805
02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About an hour.</v>

2806
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:40.850
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much did they use owing the clips?</v>

2807
02:12:40.851 --> 02:12:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Hardly any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

2808
02:12:42.681 --> 02:12:45.770
<v Speaker 3>a couple of minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2809
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:47.083
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your tendency to get riled up can be </v>

2810
02:12:49.521 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 3>exploited?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2811
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:51.780
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

2812
02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:52.420
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2813
02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 3>it's the problem of deviating from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of minimal necessary force,</v>

2814
02:12:56.361 --> 02:12:57.194
<v Speaker 3>like the best times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best interactions I've had with </v>

2815
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:03.410
<v Speaker 3>contentious journalists is where I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely kept my cool,</v>

2816
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:05.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kathy newman.</v>

2817
02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2818
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying is,</v>

2819
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:11.890
<v Speaker 3>well that's what he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2820
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like I know who you are and I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're covering it up.</v>

2821
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:15.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2822
02:13:15.891 --> 02:13:19.490
<v Speaker 3>it's these con,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these concepts.</v>

2823
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:20.443
<v Speaker 3>These are complex situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you find men and women who are </v>

2824
02:13:23.781 --> 02:13:27.080
<v Speaker 3>sexually attracted to each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're working in confined environments</v>

2825
02:13:27.081 --> 02:13:27.914
<v Speaker 3>for long periods of time and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially spend more time with the </v>

2826
02:13:30.201 --> 02:13:31.034
<v Speaker 3>people they work with and do what their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lovers and their wives and their </v>

2827
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:34.830
<v Speaker 3>husbands and it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2828
02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:38.610
<v Speaker 3>men and women interact with each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and closed in boxes is weird.</v>

2829
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:40.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what an office is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Closed inbox.</v>

2830
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:41.833
<v Speaker 3>They're all together and if they find </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other attractive and they're </v>

2831
02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:44.874
<v Speaker 3>interacting with each other socially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if there's any interaction </v>

2832
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 3>that deviates outside of work </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>

2833
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 3>they start talking about different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2834
02:13:52.381 --> 02:13:56.620
<v Speaker 3>You also don't want them to find each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other unattractive take.</v>

2835
02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:59.370
<v Speaker 3>If you're taking someone out for dinner </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a business dinner,</v>

2836
02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:02.400
<v Speaker 3>it's like even if it's guys going out </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

2837
02:14:02.401 --> 02:14:03.234
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they're working to find </v>

2838
02:14:05.461 --> 02:14:07.920
<v Speaker 3>each other unattractive and I don't mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexually.</v>

2839
02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:10.160
<v Speaker 3>There's you want to manifest yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 3>wine,</v>

2840
02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.053
<v Speaker 3>enjoy each other's company and you want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be charismatic and you want to be </v>

2841
02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:16.810
<v Speaker 3>witty and all of those things and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shade.</v>

2842
02:14:16.890 --> 02:14:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you add,</v>

2843
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:19.553
<v Speaker 3>assuming a heterosexual environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you add a heterosexual component to </v>

2844
02:14:22.501 --> 02:14:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The borders become fuzzy.</v>

2845
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:27.150
<v Speaker 3>And so I was talking about border </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions.</v>

2846
02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:28.950
<v Speaker 3>So if we're going to have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

2847
02:14:28.951 --> 02:14:31.140
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about the border conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

2848
02:14:31.141 --> 02:14:31.974
<v Speaker 3>we can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like black on the discussion you </v>

2849
02:14:34.171 --> 02:14:35.004
<v Speaker 3>guys wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you continue to agree to have </v>

2850
02:14:36.661 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 3>these conversations that are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>edited?</v>

2851
02:14:38.850 --> 02:14:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a good question.</v>

2852
02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:44.220
<v Speaker 3>The jim jefferies one was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim's a friend of mine,</v>

2853
02:14:44.490 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he gave you a good question </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you actually gave a good answer.</v>

2854
02:14:47.491 --> 02:14:49.020
<v Speaker 3>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2855
02:14:49.021 --> 02:14:49.854
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about whether or not </v>

2856
02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:53.920
<v Speaker 3>gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2857
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:56.670
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether someone should be forced to bake</v>

2858
02:14:56.671 --> 02:14:59.940
<v Speaker 3>a cake for cake for gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you said forced to probably not.</v>

2859
02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:00.571
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2860
02:15:00.571 --> 02:15:03.150
<v Speaker 3>what if they don't want to bake a cake </v>
<v Speaker 3>for black people?</v>

2861
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.460
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually,</v>

2862
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:07.650
<v Speaker 3>probably they probably should be forced </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2863
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Well probably wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2865
02:15:09.241 --> 02:15:11.670
<v Speaker 3>Well I was probably wrong in everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>I did in that,</v>

2866
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:15.930
<v Speaker 3>in that part of the discussion because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't thought that issue through enough</v>

2867
02:15:15.931 --> 02:15:16.764
<v Speaker 3>to actually give a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't expect that issue because </v>

2868
02:15:18.631 --> 02:15:20.580
<v Speaker 3>this is not something you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>commonly know.</v>

2869
02:15:20.581 --> 02:15:22.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually complicated,</v>

2870
02:15:22.261 --> 02:15:24.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously the whole I won't serve</v>

2871
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:26.820
<v Speaker 3>you because you're black thing is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

2872
02:15:27.090 --> 02:15:27.923
<v Speaker 3>But then again you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also have the right to choose who </v>

2873
02:15:29.731 --> 02:15:32.520
<v Speaker 3>you're going to affiliate with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that's complicated because it's</v>

2874
02:15:32.521 --> 02:15:35.130
<v Speaker 3>a commercial circumstance and then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're making a cake,</v>

2875
02:15:35.131 --> 02:15:37.620
<v Speaker 3>is that the same as serving or is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech?</v>

2876
02:15:37.621 --> 02:15:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

2877
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:41.850
<v Speaker 3>these are border cases that caused a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of controversy.</v>

2878
02:15:41.851 --> 02:15:44.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean serving black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's not a border case,</v>

2879
02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:45.923
<v Speaker 3>but these cases that caused a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversy is where two principals are </v>

2880
02:15:48.481 --> 02:15:52.320
<v Speaker 3>at odds and it isn't exactly clear where</v>
<v Speaker 3>to draw the line and I'm not happy with,</v>

2881
02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not happy with my answer to that,</v>

2882
02:15:55.231 --> 02:15:56.064
<v Speaker 3>but I hadn't spent the week would take </v>
<v Speaker 3>to think through the issue and really </v>

2883
02:15:59.341 --> 02:16:03.540
<v Speaker 3>have a comprehensive perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 3>expect that to be a subject anyway.</v>

2884
02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:04.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2885
02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.060
<v Speaker 3>What.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did you talk to jim for?</v>

2886
02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about 45 minutes.</v>

2887
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite a long time.</v>

2888
02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:11.731
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two minutes.</v>

2889
02:16:11.731 --> 02:16:12.564
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well my daughter has told me and and my </v>

2890
02:16:14.971 --> 02:16:16.350
<v Speaker 3>wife as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son as well.</v>

2891
02:16:16.351 --> 02:16:19.800
<v Speaker 3>in these discussions we've been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how to handle the media,</v>

2892
02:16:19.801 --> 02:16:20.634
<v Speaker 3>which has got a very complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>question and one hypothesis being don't </v>

2893
02:16:25.441 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>do interviews that will be edited and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about</v>

2894
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:33.670
<v Speaker 4>that and and been thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that might be the right answer.</v>

2895
02:16:33.671 --> 02:16:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It might be the right answer going </v>
<v Speaker 4>faster and get his as well.</v>

2896
02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:37.690
<v Speaker 4>It could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could easily be,</v>

2897
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:38.750
<v Speaker 4>although snow</v>

2898
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:42.900
<v Speaker 2>way you can't be misrepresented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust all of the problems that I've seen</v>

2899
02:16:42.901 --> 02:16:45.630
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them come from you being edited.</v>

2900
02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:46.973
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's complex subjects that </v>

2901
02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:49.673
<v Speaker 2>people would disagree with you on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at complete miss </v>

2902
02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:53.953
<v Speaker 2>characterizations of your point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these have been established because of </v>

2903
02:16:57.391 --> 02:16:58.224
<v Speaker 2>editing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2904
02:16:58.250 --> 02:17:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Well I guess the only counter argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>is this,</v>

2905
02:17:00.561 --> 02:17:05.540
<v Speaker 4>and I mean a lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these opportunities come.</v>

2906
02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:07.950
<v Speaker 4>I've had opportunities that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>at me,</v>

2907
02:17:07.951 --> 02:17:11.840
<v Speaker 4>a rate at a rate that doesn't allow me </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think them through as much as I could</v>

2908
02:17:11.841 --> 02:17:13.130
<v Speaker 4>optimally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2909
02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:13.993
<v Speaker 4>but then there's another thing which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't necessarily a mistake to lay </v>

2910
02:17:19.611 --> 02:17:20.444
<v Speaker 4>yourself open to attack because </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it reveals the motives of the </v>

2911
02:17:25.251 --> 02:17:26.084
<v Speaker 4>attackers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's what happened in the kathy </v>

2912
02:17:27.901 --> 02:17:31.540
<v Speaker 4>newman interview now that could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone really sideways.</v>

2913
02:17:31.541 --> 02:17:32.374
<v Speaker 4>Like I was lucky there to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she interviewed me for 40 </v>

2914
02:17:35.321 --> 02:17:37.630
<v Speaker 4>minutes or whatever and something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2915
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.943
<v Speaker 4>And then they did chop it down to seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes or three minutes and it was </v>

2916
02:17:42.071 --> 02:17:44.440
<v Speaker 4>exactly what you'd expect and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I expected.</v>

2917
02:17:44.441 --> 02:17:46.270
<v Speaker 4>After I walked away from the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

2918
02:17:46.271 --> 02:17:47.104
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to chop this into </v>

2919
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:49.683
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible segments and pillory me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I walked away from it because there </v>

2920
02:17:52.721 --> 02:17:53.554
<v Speaker 4>was 50 other things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then it was so funny because they </v>

2921
02:17:56.741 --> 02:17:57.574
<v Speaker 4>did do that and then they put up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole interview and the reason they put </v>

2922
02:18:00.931 --> 02:18:04.380
<v Speaker 4>up the whole interview was because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought the interview went fine.</v>

2923
02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.540
<v Speaker 4>It isn't that they knew that that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to cause commotion.</v>

2924
02:18:07.541 --> 02:18:08.770
<v Speaker 4>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a bit,</v>

2925
02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:10.930
<v Speaker 4>not a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know this for a fact,</v>

2926
02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:14.330
<v Speaker 4>so they put up the whole interview and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

2927
02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:15.233
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened was what was actually </v>

2928
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:19.090
<v Speaker 4>happening revealed itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was very,</v>

2929
02:18:19.091 --> 02:18:23.560
<v Speaker 4>very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that having that happen meant that I</v>

2930
02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:27.730
<v Speaker 4>had exposed myself to substantial stress</v>
<v Speaker 4>and risk because that was stressful.</v>

2931
02:18:27.731 --> 02:18:28.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

2932
02:18:28.931 --> 02:18:32.140
<v Speaker 4>there was the interview second </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterwards I thought,</v>

2933
02:18:32.141 --> 02:18:34.000
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get pilloried for that.</v>

2934
02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Then they did release the cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they released the whole thing.</v>

2935
02:18:38.171 --> 02:18:42.340
<v Speaker 4>Then there was all this response to it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then then the newman people who were</v>

2936
02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 4>absolutely flabbergasted by the negative</v>
<v Speaker 4>response said,</v>

2937
02:18:46.330 --> 02:18:51.330
<v Speaker 4>peterson is unleashed his army of trolls</v>
<v Speaker 4>and poor kathy had to go into hiding.</v>

2938
02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's no evidence of any </v>
<v Speaker 4>credible threats.</v>

2939
02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:54.843
<v Speaker 4>They said they called in the police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can do that Without there being </v>

2940
02:18:56.771 --> 02:18:58.840
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just say that which is what they</v>

2941
02:18:58.841 --> 02:18:59.674
<v Speaker 4>said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They played a victim narrative </v>

2942
02:19:00.401 --> 02:19:03.280
<v Speaker 4>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although one thing kathy newman is not,</v>

2943
02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:07.330
<v Speaker 4>even though she might play it at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>behest of her employers is a victim.</v>

2944
02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:09.610
<v Speaker 4>She's one of the most powerful people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>britain.</v>

2945
02:19:09.850 --> 02:19:10.683
<v Speaker 4>She's no victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to play the victim card and a </v>

2946
02:19:12.511 --> 02:19:14.730
<v Speaker 4>situation like that is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible,</v>

2947
02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:18.450
<v Speaker 4>but that's what they did and then like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dozen newspapers did it and said,</v>

2948
02:19:18.451 --> 02:19:19.284
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peterson's trolls are attacking poor </v>

2949
02:19:20.371 --> 02:19:21.151
<v Speaker 4>kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I thought,</v>

2950
02:19:21.151 --> 02:19:22.340
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now I'm screwed.</v>

2951
02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.273
<v Speaker 2>You don't own your fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the idea that people that are </v>

2952
02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:28.700
<v Speaker 2>interested in the things that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that you have control over them,</v>

2953
02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>like you can give them marching orders</v>

2954
02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.000
<v Speaker 4>person that does that well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how many million,</v>

2955
02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.550
<v Speaker 4>how many million people did there have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be before?</v>

2956
02:19:36.551 --> 02:19:38.510
<v Speaker 4>They're not all trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2957
02:19:39.130 --> 02:19:40.660
<v Speaker 4>because that was the real issue there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2958
02:19:40.661 --> 02:19:41.530
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>

2959
02:19:41.531 --> 02:19:44.380
<v Speaker 4>people commented on the video trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2960
02:19:44.381 --> 02:19:46.450
<v Speaker 4>What about 150,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2961
02:19:46.451 --> 02:19:49.600
<v Speaker 4>what about 10 million?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well now if you look at the video,</v>

2962
02:19:49.601 --> 02:19:52.540
<v Speaker 4>which is about 10 million plus all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clips,</v>

2963
02:19:52.541 --> 02:19:55.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like $50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the commentS,</v>

2964
02:19:55.241 --> 02:19:56.074
<v Speaker 4>the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comments that are critical with </v>

2965
02:19:58.331 --> 02:20:01.390
<v Speaker 4>regards to kathy newman's conduct are </v>
<v Speaker 4>running about 50 to one.</v>

2966
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So that's all trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

2967
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:04.503
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's preposterous that narratives you </v>

2968
02:20:06.841 --> 02:20:07.410
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

2969
02:20:07.410 --> 02:20:08.243
<v Speaker 4>that was a good example of taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the risk and I'm not saying it's </v>

2970
02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:15.430
<v Speaker 4>justified and I think that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very stressful,</v>

2971
02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2972
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:20.180
<v Speaker 4>you take the good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you take the bad with the good and maybe</v>

2973
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:21.043
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's time for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be time for me just to </v>

2974
02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:27.230
<v Speaker 4>disappear to some degree altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You worry about being overexposed.</v>

2975
02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:28.213
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be worried about that for a long </v>

2976
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:31.640
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2977
02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there any benefit in that?</v>

2978
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:34.633
<v Speaker 2>Is there any benefit in more exposure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we talking about the same thing we </v>

2979
02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 2>were talking about earlier with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to men working insane hours?</v>

2980
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.433
<v Speaker 2>I mean have you as your message out </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough that you don't have to do these </v>

2981
02:20:47.331 --> 02:20:49.490
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous interviews maybe instantly,</v>

2982
02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:50.320
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

2983
02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:50.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2984
02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:54.440
<v Speaker 4>and I don't want to turn it into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>parody of myself and all of that.</v>

2985
02:20:54.441 --> 02:20:55.274
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think and I am trying to handle this </v>

2986
02:20:57.171 --> 02:20:59.690
<v Speaker 4>and I've got people who are advising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were trying to figure it out.</v>

2987
02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:06.190
<v Speaker 4>I think that this tour is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2988
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:08.200
<v Speaker 4>And but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's very controlled.</v>

2989
02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:11.360
<v Speaker 4>I think we'll so completely unedited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2990
02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:14.030
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is long form conversations.</v>

2991
02:21:14.180 --> 02:21:15.013
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that coming on your podcast </v>

2992
02:21:16.341 --> 02:21:18.350
<v Speaker 4>and talking to ruben on his shows and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>forth,</v>

2993
02:21:18.351 --> 02:21:21.880
<v Speaker 4>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2994
02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:23.580
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the interaction with the journalist.</v>

2995
02:21:23.581 --> 02:21:24.414
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly not taking anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of opportunities that I have </v>

2996
02:21:27.241 --> 02:21:28.650
<v Speaker 4>in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2997
02:21:28.651 --> 02:21:31.050
<v Speaker 4>We are trying to be very careful in </v>
<v Speaker 4>picking and choosing,</v>

2998
02:21:31.051 --> 02:21:33.620
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't always go well and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>it like.</v>

2999
02:21:33.621 --> 02:21:37.680
<v Speaker 4>It could be that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be that I shouldn't do anything</v>

3000
02:21:37.681 --> 02:21:40.350
<v Speaker 4>that is edited at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's certainly possible.</v>

3001
02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:41.663
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

3002
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3003
02:21:44.161 --> 02:21:44.994
<v Speaker 2>you speak in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you speak in these long form podcasts </v>

3004
02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:51.034
<v Speaker 2>and interviews and you get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate and unpack some pretty </v>

3005
02:21:56.741 --> 02:22:01.450
<v Speaker 2>complicated issues and compare them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>other complicated issues and try to find</v>

3006
02:22:01.451 --> 02:22:06.130
<v Speaker 2>meaning in middle ground and try to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eliminate certain positions.</v>

3007
02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.760
<v Speaker 2>when you expose yourself to editing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expose yourself to someone's idea of</v>

3008
02:22:13.181 --> 02:22:14.014
<v Speaker 2>what the narrative should be and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>frame your positions in it in and </v>

3009
02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:22.630
<v Speaker 2>dishonest way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing it time and time again and</v>

3010
02:22:22.631 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 2>it exposes the problem with medium look.</v>

3011
02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:27.210
<v Speaker 5>I went to the aspen ideas festival last </v>
<v Speaker 5>week,</v>

3012
02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:28.313
<v Speaker 5>which is a whole story in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was interviewed there by a </v>

3013
02:22:30.661 --> 02:22:35.160
<v Speaker 5>journalist from the atlantic monthly and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a relatively long form interview.</v>

3014
02:22:35.161 --> 02:22:37.890
<v Speaker 5>I think we talked for 40 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>

3015
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to be edited now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I trusted her.</v>

3016
02:22:41.130 --> 02:22:41.963
<v Speaker 5>I trust her now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether that'll be how that will play </v>

3017
02:22:44.791 --> 02:22:45.624
<v Speaker 5>out in the final edit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because she won't be the </v>

3018
02:22:47.551 --> 02:22:49.790
<v Speaker 5>only one making the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3019
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:51.210
<v Speaker 5>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should have I done it?</v>

3020
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.230
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3021
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:55.420
<v Speaker 5>it was the aspen ideas festival to </v>
<v Speaker 5>different audience.</v>

3022
02:22:55.421 --> 02:22:57.030
<v Speaker 5>It's left leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

3023
02:22:57.031 --> 02:22:58.890
<v Speaker 5>well maybe I'll go talk to a left </v>
<v Speaker 5>leading audience.</v>

3024
02:22:58.891 --> 02:23:00.930
<v Speaker 5>People are always criticizing me for not</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that.</v>

3025
02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:03.180
<v Speaker 5>I usually don't do it because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get invited,</v>

3026
02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:04.283
<v Speaker 5>but so I went and talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like barry weiss interviewed me in </v>

3027
02:23:06.601 --> 02:23:07.434
<v Speaker 5>front of the aspen ideas festival and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was long form uncut and put it on </v>

3028
02:23:09.841 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 5>the web and so maybe that was useful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The atlantic thing.</v>

3029
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be good.</v>

3030
02:23:15.390 --> 02:23:16.223
<v Speaker 5>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does expose me to the risk though </v>

3031
02:23:17.561 --> 02:23:21.240
<v Speaker 5>because it will be edited so it was wise</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it.</v>

3032
02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:30.050
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been fortunate so far,</v>

3033
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:32.563
<v Speaker 5>despite the fact that I've been taken </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of context at times and fairly </v>

3034
02:23:37.191 --> 02:23:38.024
<v Speaker 5>significant proportion of times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not the overwhelming majority of </v>

3035
02:23:40.491 --> 02:23:41.324
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The net consequence of all of that has </v>

3036
02:23:44.151 --> 02:23:49.151
<v Speaker 5>been to engage more and more people into</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex dialogue as far as I can tell,</v>

3037
02:23:49.771 --> 02:23:53.070
<v Speaker 5>so that's the good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the good.</v>

3038
02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:54.053
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean that the strategy that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've implemented so far is the only </v>

3039
02:23:57.211 --> 02:23:59.160
<v Speaker 5>strategy that will work into the future.</v>

3040
02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:03.040
<v Speaker 2>We can also clearly establish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't plan any of this to happen,</v>

3041
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.903
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing that happened from you </v>

3042
02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:09.780
<v Speaker 2>opposing that bill and then going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are.</v>

3043
02:24:09.781 --> 02:24:11.190
<v Speaker 2>How many years later now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years.</v>

3044
02:24:11.191 --> 02:24:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Two years almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

3045
02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:14.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you think about the </v>

3046
02:24:14.851 --> 02:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>transformation of your life and your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your public image.</v>

3047
02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3048
02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:21.113
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of a single public </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual that has gone from being a </v>

3049
02:24:24.061 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 2>universal university professor to being </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a household name.</v>

3050
02:24:28.350 --> 02:24:29.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get brought up With at least my </v>

3051
02:24:30.421 --> 02:24:33.960
<v Speaker 2>circle of friends all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I run into all the time.</v>

3052
02:24:33.961 --> 02:24:34.794
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you how many people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>run into after comedy shows or in an </v>

3053
02:24:37.411 --> 02:24:38.244
<v Speaker 2>airport that they talk to me about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a mainstream thing and not </v>

3054
02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:46.170
<v Speaker 2>just no precedent.</v>

3055
02:24:46.390 --> 02:24:47.410
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3056
02:24:47.411 --> 02:24:48.250
<v Speaker 5>it's partly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3057
02:24:48.251 --> 02:24:50.470
<v Speaker 5>that's also part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conseqUeNces of this technology.</v>

3058
02:24:50.471 --> 02:24:51.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3059
02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:52.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in 2013,</v>

3060
02:24:52.730 --> 02:24:53.770
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huh,</v>

3061
02:24:53.771 --> 02:24:57.070
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what will happen if I put my </v>
<v Speaker 5>lectures up on youtube.</v>

3062
02:24:57.310 --> 02:24:58.143
<v Speaker 5>It's like beware man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I thought when I made </v>

3063
02:25:01.831 --> 02:25:04.180
<v Speaker 5>the bill see 16 videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got up at like two in the morning.</v>

3064
02:25:04.181 --> 02:25:06.490
<v Speaker 5>I thought this is bloody well driving me</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

3065
02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:11.260
<v Speaker 5>that damn university is going to force a</v>
<v Speaker 5>UNconscious bias retraining,</v>

3066
02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:12.213
<v Speaker 5>which is not a validated process by any </v>
<v Speaker 5>stretch of the imagination on its </v>

3067
02:25:15.071 --> 02:25:15.904
<v Speaker 5>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I worked for the university and I'm </v>

3068
02:25:16.961 --> 02:25:18.070
<v Speaker 5>a psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3069
02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:20.210
<v Speaker 2>what is the what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are they doing that?</v>

3070
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:21.163
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did do that to silence that are </v>

3071
02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:26.170
<v Speaker 2>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they doing that because they want to</v>

3072
02:25:26.171 --> 02:25:28.360
<v Speaker 2>enforce a certain type of behavior,</v>

3073
02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:29.453
<v Speaker 4>why they think there's two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's some genuine </v>

3074
02:25:32.011 --> 02:25:32.844
<v Speaker 4>concern for the dispossessed and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some hatred for the successful </v>

3075
02:25:36.301 --> 02:25:39.030
<v Speaker 4>and some envy and some resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything that people do,</v>

3076
02:25:39.031 --> 02:25:40.200
<v Speaker 4>it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3077
02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:44.640
<v Speaker 4>but the pathology is well that the hr </v>
<v Speaker 4>types,</v>

3078
02:25:44.641 --> 02:25:48.360
<v Speaker 4>for example at the university think it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay for them to read train other people</v>

3079
02:25:48.361 --> 02:25:52.660
<v Speaker 4>about their hypothetical views on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>off chance that they might be racist and</v>

3080
02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:53.553
<v Speaker 4>and forcing them to admit that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist by making them agree to </v>

3081
02:25:55.951 --> 02:25:58.580
<v Speaker 4>participate in the training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that,</v>

3082
02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:01.410
<v Speaker 4>but for me that waSn't even the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue,</v>

3083
02:26:01.411 --> 02:26:02.244
<v Speaker 4>although it was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is we can't measure </v>

3084
02:26:04.651 --> 02:26:05.484
<v Speaker 4>unconscious bias reliably and validly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a psychologist and a research </v>

3085
02:26:08.941 --> 02:26:10.530
<v Speaker 4>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the literature,</v>

3086
02:26:10.531 --> 02:26:12.870
<v Speaker 4>that's a misuse of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a misuse of it.</v>

3087
02:26:12.871 --> 02:26:13.704
<v Speaker 4>And the damn university was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were hiring consUltants who didn't </v>

3088
02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:17.390
<v Speaker 4>know what the hell they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3089
02:26:17.470 --> 02:26:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are,</v>

3090
02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:22.080
<v Speaker 2>this is a universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>

3091
02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:23.353
<v Speaker 2>an establishment for higher learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can they possibly act on something </v>

3092
02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:32.740
<v Speaker 2>when there's no clear evidence that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

3093
02:26:32.741 --> 02:26:35.920
<v Speaker 2>that it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's effective and they're doing it</v>

3094
02:26:35.921 --> 02:26:36.754
<v Speaker 2>just to make people happy or just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make themselves happy or just to </v>

3095
02:26:39.701 --> 02:26:41.200
<v Speaker 2>reinforce an idea that they want</v>

3096
02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:42.270
<v Speaker 4>to be told.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

3097
02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:43.410
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of.</v>

3098
02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:44.273
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was part of the head gemini of the </v>

3099
02:26:45.871 --> 02:26:47.300
<v Speaker 4>radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3100
02:26:47.350 --> 02:26:48.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3101
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.760
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to do that at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

3102
02:26:50.761 --> 02:26:51.594
<v Speaker 4>I work out without me telling people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's no warrant for that from </v>

3103
02:26:55.831 --> 02:26:58.530
<v Speaker 4>the psychological community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

3104
02:26:58.531 --> 02:27:00.360
<v Speaker 4>I got up at two in the morning and made </v>
<v Speaker 4>these videos.</v>

3105
02:27:00.361 --> 02:27:01.050
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3106
02:27:01.050 --> 02:27:02.730
<v Speaker 4>let's see what happens if I make these </v>
<v Speaker 4>videos.</v>

3107
02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:03.481
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3108
02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:07.590
<v Speaker 4>this is back to the technology issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I didn't know what youtube was</v>

3109
02:27:07.591 --> 02:27:10.410
<v Speaker 4>when I put my videos on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know what youtube was.</v>

3110
02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:11.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I.</v>

3111
02:27:11.250 --> 02:27:14.190
<v Speaker 4>No one knows what youtube is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the thing,</v>

3112
02:27:14.191 --> 02:27:17.220
<v Speaker 4>we'll look at what happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a million,</v>

3113
02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:18.053
<v Speaker 4>billion and a half downloads a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're definitely riding a </v>

3114
02:27:20.701 --> 02:27:21.450
<v Speaker 4>giant wave.</v>

3115
02:27:21.450 --> 02:27:23.970
<v Speaker 4>like what have you predicted this 15 </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeArs ago?</v>

3116
02:27:24.750 --> 02:27:25.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

3117
02:27:25.681 --> 02:27:26.514
<v Speaker 4>So you know you're in the right place </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the right time and you're a very </v>

3118
02:27:28.441 --> 02:27:29.274
<v Speaker 4>interesting interview because while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for long form because you're </v>

3119
02:27:32.191 --> 02:27:35.340
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very curious,</v>

3120
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:37.320
<v Speaker 4>but also very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very tough.</v>

3121
02:27:37.321 --> 02:27:38.154
<v Speaker 4>Like it's interesting watching you </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you don't understand </v>

3122
02:27:40.411 --> 02:27:41.244
<v Speaker 4>something you will go after the person </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're not doing it in a vindictive </v>

3123
02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:44.754
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're quite a formidable interview </v>

3124
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:46.683
<v Speaker 4>and I've been trying to figure out why </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so successful and like you're a </v>

3125
02:27:49.621 --> 02:27:52.680
<v Speaker 4>lot smarter than anyone might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is quite interesting.</v>

3126
02:27:52.681 --> 02:27:53.514
<v Speaker 4>So you're a weird combination because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know your persona doesn't shout </v>

3127
02:27:56.490 --> 02:27:57.323
<v Speaker 4>intEllectual but you're damn smart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're tough as a bloody boot and you </v>

3128
02:28:00.331 --> 02:28:01.164
<v Speaker 4>ask rudy pop provocative questions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not because you're provocative and so </v>

3129
02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:07.860
<v Speaker 4>your personality in this long form seem </v>
<v Speaker 4>to suit each other really well.</v>

3130
02:28:07.861 --> 02:28:08.694
<v Speaker 4>You're also really good at pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you don't understand instead of </v>

3131
02:28:11.191 --> 02:28:12.810
<v Speaker 4>assuming that you know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

3132
02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:15.390
<v Speaker 4>so you take the listeners on a journey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3133
02:28:15.391 --> 02:28:16.224
<v Speaker 4>It's an exploratory journey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fundamentally what's propelled you </v>

3134
02:28:19.441 --> 02:28:21.950
<v Speaker 4>to superstardom in some sense is not</v>

3135
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:23.930
<v Speaker 5>just your ability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is non trivial,</v>

3136
02:28:23.931 --> 02:28:27.290
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that you're on this giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological wave and you're one of the</v>

3137
02:28:27.291 --> 02:28:28.124
<v Speaker 5>first adopters and I'm in the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation where first adopters of </v>

3138
02:28:32.390 --> 02:28:35.030
<v Speaker 5>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's as revolutionary as the gutenberg</v>

3139
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:36.133
<v Speaker 5>printing press,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's all unfolding in real </v>

3140
02:28:38.151 --> 02:28:38.984
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>IT's like,</v>

3141
02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.790
<v Speaker 5>look at what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3142
02:28:40.791 --> 02:28:41.624
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spoken word is now as powerful as </v>

3143
02:28:43.251 --> 02:28:47.510
<v Speaker 5>the written word that's never happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>before in human history and we're on the</v>

3144
02:28:47.511 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 5>cutting edge of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For better or worse.</v>

3145
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:51.910
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The spoken word is power.</v>

3146
02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:53.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe even more so.</v>

3147
02:28:53.351 --> 02:28:54.184
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so accessible to people that don't </v>

3148
02:28:55.191 --> 02:28:59.050
<v Speaker 5>have the time to read well or stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 5>traffic or or.</v>

3149
02:28:59.051 --> 02:28:59.884
<v Speaker 5>And here's another possibility may be 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>times as many people can listen to </v>

3150
02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:07.490
<v Speaker 5>complex information as can read complex </v>
<v Speaker 5>information in terms of their ability to</v>

3151
02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 5>process it.</v>

3152
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Sure could easily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

3153
02:29:11.151 --> 02:29:11.984
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's maybe it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly easier to listen to a book on </v>

3154
02:29:14.721 --> 02:29:16.580
<v Speaker 5>tape for me than it is to read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3155
02:29:16.581 --> 02:29:17.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3156
02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:19.490
<v Speaker 5>so the question is for how many people </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that true?</v>

3157
02:29:19.491 --> 02:29:21.140
<v Speaker 5>And I would say it might be true for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3158
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:24.410
<v Speaker 5>for the majority of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then people are doing hybrids,</v>

3159
02:29:24.411 --> 02:29:25.244
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so because you can sync your book with </v>

3160
02:29:27.411 --> 02:29:28.400
<v Speaker 5>audible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3161
02:29:28.401 --> 02:29:31.700
<v Speaker 5>So they read when they have the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then when they have found time,</v>

3162
02:29:31.701 --> 02:29:35.870
<v Speaker 5>which is also a major component of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's the time when you're driving</v>

3163
02:29:35.871 --> 02:29:36.704
<v Speaker 5>or the time when you're doing dishes is </v>
<v Speaker 5>now all of a sudden you can educate </v>

3164
02:29:38.571 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 5>yourself during that found time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>ThiS is a big revolution.</v>

3165
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.200
<v Speaker 5>And the blowing out the bandwidth makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>a huge difference.</v>

3166
02:29:45.201 --> 02:29:46.970
<v Speaker 5>Because while we talked about that at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the beginning,</v>

3167
02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:48.373
<v Speaker 5>looks like people are more intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 5>than we thought And you and I are both </v>

3168
02:29:51.201 --> 02:29:52.910
<v Speaker 5>in the rest of this intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dark web.</v>

3169
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:53.743
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of what unites us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey is everybody has an independent </v>

3170
02:29:56.421 --> 02:29:57.980
<v Speaker 5>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Virtually everybody,</v>

3171
02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:00.590
<v Speaker 5>they have an idiosyncratic view point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

3172
02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:01.523
<v Speaker 5>they're interested in having discussions</v>
<v Speaker 5>and pursuing the furtherance of their </v>

3173
02:30:04.311 --> 02:30:07.340
<v Speaker 5>knowledge even though they Might have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>priority ideological commitments.</v>

3174
02:30:07.341 --> 02:30:10.970
<v Speaker 5>Sam does and I suppose I do and and ben </v>
<v Speaker 5>shapiro certainly does,</v>

3175
02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:13.430
<v Speaker 5>but they're still interested in having </v>
<v Speaker 5>the discussion,</v>

3176
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:14.623
<v Speaker 5>but more importantly they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalizing on the long form and the </v>

3177
02:30:17.991 --> 02:30:18.824
<v Speaker 5>fact that that's possible is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>reflection of this technological </v>

3178
02:30:20.661 --> 02:30:21.494
<v Speaker 5>transformation and the technological </v>
<v Speaker 5>transfer information might be utterly </v>

3179
02:30:24.651 --> 02:30:26.810
<v Speaker 5>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it.</v>

3180
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:28.620
<v Speaker 5>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3181
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:30.800
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to sort this out </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I keep thinking,</v>

3182
02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:33.200
<v Speaker 5>why the hell are these people coming to </v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to what I'm saying?</v>

3183
02:30:33.201 --> 02:30:33.861
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3184
02:30:33.861 --> 02:30:34.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm a guru.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3185
02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:36.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm a sage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that.</v>

3186
02:30:36.651 --> 02:30:39.230
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't be thinking that first.</v>

3187
02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:43.370
<v Speaker 5>Think if there's situational </v>
<v Speaker 5>determinants first.</v>

3188
02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Take your damn personality out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3189
02:30:45.711 --> 02:30:47.420
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>

3190
02:30:47.421 --> 02:30:50.480
<v Speaker 5>this is all fostered by youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fostered by podcasts.</v>

3191
02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:54.470
<v Speaker 5>What's so new about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No bandwidth restrictions,</v>

3192
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:55.543
<v Speaker 5>no barrier to entrance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility of dialogue because people </v>

3193
02:30:59.121 --> 02:31:02.120
<v Speaker 5>cut up the youtube videos into chunks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and make their own comments on it.</v>

3194
02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:04.610
<v Speaker 5>It's a whole new communication </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

3195
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:05.563
<v Speaker 5>Also a lack of interference by </v>
<v Speaker 5>executives and producers and all these </v>

3196
02:31:08.271 --> 02:31:10.760
<v Speaker 5>different people that have their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>bias unmediated.</v>

3197
02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:12.350
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unmediated as giant.</v>

3198
02:31:12.351 --> 02:31:12.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3199
02:31:12.711 --> 02:31:13.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's all part of.</v>

3200
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:14.503
<v Speaker 5>Part of the reason you're so popular too</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like you just put this on like so </v>

3201
02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:19.440
<v Speaker 5>you've got exactly the right of</v>

3202
02:31:20.050 --> 02:31:25.050
<v Speaker 2>a competent production because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing access about it.</v>

3203
02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Like it's competent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no more than that.</v>

3204
02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I know that's by design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also don't edit it.</v>

3205
02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:33.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like what you see is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everyone is relieved by that.</v>

3206
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>We can make our own damn decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I think that's very important?</v>

3207
02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:38.970
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone is honest,</v>

3208
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't decide what to leave in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to take out and it's just,</v>

3209
02:31:43.721 --> 02:31:44.554
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's partly also why I deal with the </v>

3210
02:31:45.721 --> 02:31:46.554
<v Speaker 2>press the way I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I'm going to have a full </v>

3211
02:31:48.001 --> 02:31:48.834
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm willing to take the hits </v>

3212
02:31:51.010 --> 02:31:51.843
<v Speaker 2>and I understand what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one of the reasons why it </v>

3213
02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:56.700
<v Speaker 2>frustrates me so much is that I see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing and I'm like,</v>

3214
02:31:56.701 --> 02:31:59.940
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is it's,</v>

3215
02:31:59.950 --> 02:32:00.280
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3216
02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:03.030
<v Speaker 2>This is what people did 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago for.</v>

3217
02:32:03.210 --> 02:32:05.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't really do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't misrepresent.</v>

3218
02:32:05.911 --> 02:32:07.950
<v Speaker 2>People used to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were in the press,</v>

3219
02:32:08.130 --> 02:32:10.170
<v Speaker 2>you can take people quoted out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>

3220
02:32:10.171 --> 02:32:11.004
<v Speaker 2>do whatever the fuck you wanted to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>an article about them and they couldn't </v>

3221
02:32:12.841 --> 02:32:17.730
<v Speaker 2>do a god damn thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened to me in 19 boy.</v>

3222
02:32:18.210 --> 02:32:23.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like 99.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a comedy cd that came out and this</v>

3223
02:32:23.521 --> 02:32:25.340
<v Speaker 2>woman wrote an article about it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

3224
02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:29.250
<v Speaker 2>She just lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lied about my perspective.</v>

3225
02:32:29.251 --> 02:32:32.910
<v Speaker 2>She lied about the bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she misquoted the bits.</v>

3226
02:32:32.970 --> 02:32:33.803
<v Speaker 2>She didn't just paraphrase them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she changed what the bits were to make </v>

3227
02:32:37.711 --> 02:32:42.510
<v Speaker 2>them know misogynist or hateful or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>

3228
02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:46.350
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no recourse.</v>

3229
02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.940
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing that I could do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3230
02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3231
02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I'd never experienced that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3232
02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:51.294
<v Speaker 2>this is stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I found out this person did </v>

3233
02:32:52.651 --> 02:32:53.484
<v Speaker 2>that a lot and this is what she did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's ultimate power that comes with </v>

3234
02:32:56.791 --> 02:32:57.624
<v Speaker 2>being the person that has the pen being </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that has the typewriter and </v>

3235
02:32:59.821 --> 02:33:00.654
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the person who works for the </v>

3236
02:33:01.891 --> 02:33:03.780
<v Speaker 2>boston globe or whatever the publication</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3237
02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that that is something that existed </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

3238
02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:08.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you had to be either a friend </v>

3239
02:33:11.251 --> 02:33:13.350
<v Speaker 2>of the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to play ball,</v>

3240
02:33:13.351 --> 02:33:15.390
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a bend to their will,</v>

3241
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:16.343
<v Speaker 2>you have to do what they wanted you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do and they could misrepresent you and </v>

3242
02:33:19.171 --> 02:33:21.000
<v Speaker 2>choose to paint you in any way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

3243
02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:23.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's one of the reasons why I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything anymore.</v>

3244
02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:25.530
<v Speaker 2>We don't do any interviews anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything,</v>

3245
02:33:25.531 --> 02:33:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do anything.</v>

3246
02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Just I do enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3247
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:31.230
<v Speaker 2>You want to know about me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking there's a thousand Podcasts,</v>

3248
02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:33.720
<v Speaker 2>there's more than a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

3249
02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:37.330
<v Speaker 2>there's 1100 and there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones too.</v>

3250
02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It so well that,</v>

3251
02:33:39.850 --> 02:33:40.510
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3252
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:41.343
<v Speaker 2>that it may also be the position that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly find myself yet I think </v>

3253
02:33:45.241 --> 02:33:49.200
<v Speaker 2>it's the right position because then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresentations don't exist anymore.</v>

3254
02:33:49.201 --> 02:33:50.034
<v Speaker 2>So then the only problem is the dispute </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the actual ideological </v>

3255
02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:54.320
<v Speaker 2>conversations or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3256
02:33:54.330 --> 02:33:56.400
<v Speaker 2>the actual concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3257
02:33:56.401 --> 02:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3258
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:58.343
<v Speaker 2>you made a point there that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is like we are in a new </v>

3259
02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:03.240
<v Speaker 2>media landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now if someone comes out as a,</v>

3260
02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:04.493
<v Speaker 2>as a media figure with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional credibility and </v>

3261
02:34:08.881 --> 02:34:11.640
<v Speaker 2>misrepresents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exposed.</v>

3262
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:12.563
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question is how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk should you shoulder to expose the </v>

3263
02:34:16.201 --> 02:34:18.520
<v Speaker 2>proclivity for misrepresentation</v>

3264
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:22.600
<v Speaker 4>and answer to that might be some now it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be moving,</v>

3265
02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:24.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I've done enough of that.</v>

3266
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:25.713
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be easier for me in many ways </v>

3267
02:34:26.921 --> 02:34:28.780
<v Speaker 4>if I just stopped doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3268
02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:34.300
<v Speaker 4>but there is some utility in having it </v>
<v Speaker 4>play out and so while,</v>

3269
02:34:34.301 --> 02:34:35.134
<v Speaker 4>so I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to only take those </v>

3270
02:34:37.121 --> 02:34:37.954
<v Speaker 4>opportunities that appear to have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit than risk and when I'm defining </v>

3271
02:34:43.831 --> 02:34:44.664
<v Speaker 4>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the question is then what </v>

3272
02:34:46.581 --> 02:34:47.414
<v Speaker 4>constitutes benefit and I guess what </v>
<v Speaker 4>constitutes benefit is while that would </v>

3273
02:34:52.101 --> 02:34:52.934
<v Speaker 4>further the attempts that I making to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bring information to a vast number of </v>

3274
02:34:57.771 --> 02:34:58.604
<v Speaker 4>people that could conceivably help them </v>
<v Speaker 4>stabilize and improve their individual </v>

3275
02:35:02.481 --> 02:35:04.370
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's worth a certain amount of risk.</v>

3276
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly increases your profile,</v>

3277
02:35:06.221 --> 02:35:07.054
<v Speaker 2>increases your profile and even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have 60 percent of these people are </v>

3278
02:35:10.481 --> 02:35:13.270
<v Speaker 2>gonna get a bad perception of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty percent of these people that never</v>

3279
02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:14.104
<v Speaker 2>heard of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're going to understand who you </v>

3280
02:35:15.131 --> 02:35:16.990
<v Speaker 2>are because they do further </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

3281
02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:19.120
<v Speaker 2>So there's some benefit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3282
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:20.290
<v Speaker 2>the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>

3283
02:35:20.350 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I get text messages from random people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was friends with years ago.</v>

3284
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:24.663
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's Jordan Peterson has </v>
<v Speaker 2>just such a lying sack of shit and he's </v>

3285
02:35:27.610 --> 02:35:29.890
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who the fuck you are.</v>

3286
02:35:30.130 --> 02:35:32.680
<v Speaker 2>And then second of all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you contacting me?</v>

3287
02:35:32.681 --> 02:35:36.790
<v Speaker 2>You're not even saying hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying Jordan Peterson is a mrs.</v>

3288
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3289
02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Well there's an emergency at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scam artist.</v>

3290
02:35:40.691 --> 02:35:42.460
<v Speaker 2>He's a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's and I'm like,</v>

3291
02:35:42.490 --> 02:35:44.860
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they'll see an interview,</v>

3292
02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:47.170
<v Speaker 2>you know like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jim jefferies clip,</v>

3293
02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.910
<v Speaker 2>which is a minute long or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3294
02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:49.923
<v Speaker 2>or the vice piece or the initial kathy </v>
<v Speaker 2>newman piece and they just formed this </v>

3295
02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:59.830
<v Speaker 2>determined position on you and then read</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit pieces on you.</v>

3296
02:36:00.010 --> 02:36:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And then this is where they take their </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion out.</v>

3297
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:05.120
<v Speaker 2>This is where it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's and it's,</v>

3298
02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:06.943
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like these are the last gasps of </v>

3299
02:36:09.251 --> 02:36:11.200
<v Speaker 2>a dying medium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3300
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think too,</v>

3301
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:15.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that people appreciate it.</v>

3302
02:36:15.611 --> 02:36:16.444
<v Speaker 2>I think the people that are listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this that do appreciate long form </v>

3303
02:36:18.431 --> 02:36:21.250
<v Speaker 2>conversations and with all warts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

3304
02:36:21.251 --> 02:36:22.084
<v Speaker 2>all the ugliness and the mistakes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the critical errors and the people that </v>

3305
02:36:26.411 --> 02:36:27.940
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3306
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:28.833
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a real hate for being lied to </v>

3307
02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:34.780
<v Speaker 2>because it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It changed when</v>

3308
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:37.560
<v Speaker 4>when you're being treated as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>

3309
02:36:38.570 --> 02:36:39.403
<v Speaker 4>which they aren't.</v>

3310
02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's both.</v>

3311
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:42.050
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3312
02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.273
<v Speaker 2>it's deceptive when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you edit someone and take their </v>

3313
02:36:47.121 --> 02:36:49.130
<v Speaker 2>words out of context and change them </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

3314
02:36:49.131 --> 02:36:49.964
<v Speaker 2>you're being deceptive.</v>

3315
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Did The New York times did that again </v>
<v Speaker 4>this week?</v>

3316
02:36:52.041 --> 02:36:52.874
<v Speaker 4>They had some philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Professor from Hong Kong university </v>

3317
02:36:54.621 --> 02:36:56.510
<v Speaker 4>wrote a piece on me and he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took,</v>

3318
02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:57.553
<v Speaker 4>they quoted me a was a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first phrase was in quotes and then </v>

3319
02:37:00.951 --> 02:37:01.784
<v Speaker 4>there were some joining words and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the second phrase was in quotes and </v>

3320
02:37:03.621 --> 02:37:04.454
<v Speaker 4>there were some joining words and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the third phrase was in quotes and the </v>

3321
02:37:06.621 --> 02:37:07.454
<v Speaker 4>three quotes added up to a statement </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bore no resemblance whatsoever to </v>

3322
02:37:10.251 --> 02:37:11.084
<v Speaker 4>what I was saying.</v>

3323
02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:12.900
<v Speaker 2>How can they do that in the New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>times?</v>

3324
02:37:13.050 --> 02:37:16.230
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to be something should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the the</v>

3325
02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.280
<v Speaker 4>synthesis of what they think they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

3326
02:37:19.281 --> 02:37:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I think they're killing their brand so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast that they can't put it.</v>

3327
02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:24.113
<v Speaker 4>It's so disturbing to me as a person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's been a fan of the New York times </v>

3328
02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:27.464
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand how they could </v>

3329
02:37:28.671 --> 02:37:31.310
<v Speaker 4>allow that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How could you allow your.</v>

3330
02:37:32.170 --> 02:37:35.450
<v Speaker 4>What is the gold standard for </v>
<v Speaker 4>journalism?</v>

3331
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:36.493
<v Speaker 4>How could you allow it to become </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that willfully misrepresent </v>

3332
02:37:39.351 --> 02:37:40.184
<v Speaker 4>someone but they never did to push an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology or did put my book on the New </v>

3333
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:45.440
<v Speaker 4>York times bestseller list?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's quite comical.</v>

3334
02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:47.390
<v Speaker 4>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3335
02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:49.550
<v Speaker 4>they have rules which they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>disclose,</v>

3336
02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 4>but one of them apparently is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3337
02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:54.140
<v Speaker 4>if the book is published in Canada and </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed in the United States,</v>

3338
02:37:54.141 --> 02:37:54.974
<v Speaker 4>then it doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though they've had books like that </v>

3339
02:37:56.601 --> 02:37:59.420
<v Speaker 4>on the New York times best seller list </v>
<v Speaker 4>before and I think,</v>

3340
02:37:59.421 --> 02:38:01.070
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well is this bad or good?</v>

3341
02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:01.731
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3342
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:02.564
<v Speaker 4>it's bad because to the degree that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>might want to be on the New York times </v>

3343
02:38:05.421 --> 02:38:07.580
<v Speaker 4>best seller list,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although I haven't been losing any sleep</v>

3344
02:38:07.581 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 4>over it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're selling.</v>

3345
02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I know how many books are selling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3346
02:38:10.731 --> 02:38:11.564
<v Speaker 4>it's basically been the best selling </v>
<v Speaker 4>book in the world since january know </v>

3347
02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:15.033
<v Speaker 4>it's gone up and down to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fundamentally it should be the </v>

3348
02:38:17.271 --> 02:38:19.370
<v Speaker 4>number one New York times best selling </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

3349
02:38:19.371 --> 02:38:20.060
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3350
02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:21.450
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have their reasons and.</v>

3351
02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:22.303
<v Speaker 4>But I look at that and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well you can only do that 10 times </v>

3352
02:38:25.131 --> 02:38:28.070
<v Speaker 4>until you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like because it's a fatal error.</v>

3353
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:30.290
<v Speaker 4>You have the gold standard for </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurement.</v>

3354
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:34.430
<v Speaker 4>You're not measuring properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're burning up your brand.</v>

3355
02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:35.293
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we're the New York times so we can </v>

3356
02:38:36.471 --> 02:38:37.580
<v Speaker 4>burn up our brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3357
02:38:37.970 --> 02:38:38.661
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

3358
02:38:38.661 --> 02:38:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Newsweek is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Time magazine is a shallow is a shell of</v>

3359
02:38:42.561 --> 02:38:43.550
<v Speaker 4>its former self.</v>

3360
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:45.043
<v Speaker 4>Like the big things disappear and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappeared when they get crooked and </v>

3361
02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:49.333
<v Speaker 4>ideologically rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what's happening at the </v>

3362
02:38:51.921 --> 02:38:54.260
<v Speaker 4>New York times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not with everyone there,</v>

3363
02:38:54.261 --> 02:38:58.310
<v Speaker 4>but with plenty of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it'll die faster than people think,</v>

3364
02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:03.170
<v Speaker 4>but it's so confusing to me that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't use to be that.</v>

3365
02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:04.640
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now it is.</v>

3366
02:39:04.641 --> 02:39:05.474
<v Speaker 4>And they just responding to this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>world where you have to have click bait </v>

3367
02:39:09.141 --> 02:39:09.974
<v Speaker 4>journalism and some people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggling to find people to actually </v>

3368
02:39:13.281 --> 02:39:16.320
<v Speaker 4>buy physical newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is two different things.</v>

3369
02:39:16.321 --> 02:39:17.154
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say like because maybe see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird because you don't have to </v>

3370
02:39:20.241 --> 02:39:21.074
<v Speaker 4>resort to click bait because these long </v>
<v Speaker 4>form discussions are the antithesis of </v>

3371
02:39:25.470 --> 02:39:28.700
<v Speaker 4>clickbait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but are they struggling in terms of like</v>

3372
02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:31.130
<v Speaker 4>how many people buy their newspaper?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3373
02:39:31.131 --> 02:39:32.420
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every newspaper,</v>

3374
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:33.283
<v Speaker 4>the newspapers in Canada went cap in </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand to the federal government for </v>

3375
02:39:35.721 --> 02:39:36.554
<v Speaker 4>subsidies about six months ago because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dying so fast and so some of it </v>

3376
02:39:40.011 --> 02:39:42.260
<v Speaker 4>is they're being supplanted by </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

3377
02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:45.100
<v Speaker 4>ThAt's a huge part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as they are supplanted,</v>

3378
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.943
<v Speaker 4>they get more desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They publish more polarizing stories </v>

3379
02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:50.840
<v Speaker 4>that works in the short term to garner </v>
<v Speaker 4>more views,</v>

3380
02:39:50.841 --> 02:39:54.050
<v Speaker 4>but it alienates people from the brand </v>
<v Speaker 4>and speeds their demise.</v>

3381
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:55.063
<v Speaker 4>Classic death spiral of a big of a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization and that's going to clean </v>

3382
02:39:59.211 --> 02:40:00.044
<v Speaker 4>things out like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know where cnn is in the </v>

3383
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:04.340
<v Speaker 4>cable news rankings now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cable show rankings,</v>

3384
02:40:04.341 --> 02:40:05.174
<v Speaker 4>but it keeps falling but it's falling in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rankings as cable itself </v>

3385
02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:12.020
<v Speaker 4>disintegrates and dies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you need cable tv?</v>

3386
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 4>No one needs cable</v>

3387
02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:14.913
<v Speaker 5>t the only people who have cable tv or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people who figure haven't figured </v>

3388
02:40:17.251 --> 02:40:21.540
<v Speaker 5>out yet that you can replace it entirely</v>
<v Speaker 5>online for like one 10th the price with,</v>

3389
02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:22.130
<v Speaker 5>with</v>

3390
02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:22.963
<v Speaker 2>less hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the irony is people want a location </v>

3391
02:40:25.251 --> 02:40:26.084
<v Speaker 2>they can go to to find out what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in the world and this is the one </v>

3392
02:40:28.671 --> 02:40:31.670
<v Speaker 2>thing that they use to represent and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3393
02:40:31.671 --> 02:40:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think fox news is any </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

3394
02:40:33.561 --> 02:40:36.230
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have these ideological extremes</v>

3395
02:40:36.231 --> 02:40:40.070
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember very clearly watching the</v>

3396
02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:44.420
<v Speaker 2>election coverage before the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like leading up to the election,</v>

3397
02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I would go fox news and then I go see an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ent.</v>

3398
02:40:46.821 --> 02:40:47.654
<v Speaker 2>I just would go back and forth with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my cable and I would just be </v>

3399
02:40:49.971 --> 02:40:50.840
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>

3400
02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:51.674
<v Speaker 2>what is really happening in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm getting two different </v>

3401
02:40:53.901 --> 02:40:54.734
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting Russia and I'm getting </v>

3402
02:40:56.181 --> 02:40:57.530
<v Speaker 2>hillary's emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

3403
02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3404
02:40:59.090 --> 02:40:59.923
<v Speaker 2>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting pussy grabbing and I'm </v>

3405
02:41:01.851 --> 02:41:02.880
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3406
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:03.833
<v Speaker 2>a bengazi yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm getting and I don't </v>

3407
02:41:06.411 --> 02:41:09.860
<v Speaker 2>understand like why this is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological.</v>

3408
02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:10.813
<v Speaker 2>This is not just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be that as the technology is </v>

3409
02:41:13.431 --> 02:41:14.264
<v Speaker 2>supplanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideological polarization increases </v>

3410
02:41:17.511 --> 02:41:19.040
<v Speaker 2>as the thing dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3411
02:41:19.041 --> 02:41:19.874
<v Speaker 2>They're struggling for anyone to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and this is the way they have </v>

3412
02:41:22.401 --> 02:41:23.420
<v Speaker 2>to do it to ensure.</v>

3413
02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:27.410
<v Speaker 5>And I think what's happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other side which is decide you occupy,</v>

3414
02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:28.244
<v Speaker 5>say is that a new technology that's long</v>
<v Speaker 5>form that deals with many of those </v>

3415
02:41:32.171 --> 02:41:34.320
<v Speaker 5>problems is emerging and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerge.</v>

3416
02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:35.213
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be victorious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the main might already be </v>

3417
02:41:37.471 --> 02:41:38.304
<v Speaker 2>victorious in the meantime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad stuff still exists in the digital </v>

3418
02:41:42.091 --> 02:41:43.280
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3419
02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:45.600
<v Speaker 2>and then you're getting a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles that are written about you.</v>

3420
02:41:45.601 --> 02:41:48.390
<v Speaker 2>People are absorbing these articles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not from a physical form.</v>

3421
02:41:48.391 --> 02:41:50.340
<v Speaker 2>You're getting it from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From digital.</v>

3422
02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:51.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well okay.</v>

3423
02:41:51.241 --> 02:41:52.074
<v Speaker 5>So then the sense is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well do you have fundamental trust in </v>

3424
02:41:54.061 --> 02:41:59.061
<v Speaker 5>the judgment of your fellow man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say in my answer to that is yes,</v>

3425
02:41:59.131 --> 02:41:59.964
<v Speaker 5>because although I've been pilloried to </v>
<v Speaker 5>a great degree by the radical types in </v>

3426
02:42:03.931 --> 02:42:07.230
<v Speaker 5>the commentary in the classic </v>
<v Speaker 5>journalists,</v>

3427
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:10.003
<v Speaker 5>the comments with regards to me on </v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube are 50 to one in my favor and </v>

3428
02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:18.140
<v Speaker 5>that's even the case when the ideologues</v>
<v Speaker 5>put up videos about me,</v>

3429
02:42:18.141 --> 02:42:22.280
<v Speaker 5>they're designed to discredit me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've sold a million and a half books.</v>

3430
02:42:22.430 --> 02:42:23.263
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be published in 40 </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries and thousands of people are </v>

3431
02:42:26.061 --> 02:42:26.894
<v Speaker 5>coming to my lectures and so I would say</v>
<v Speaker 5>the attempts to discredit me aren't </v>

3432
02:42:30.951 --> 02:42:35.951
<v Speaker 5>working so and now I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that even like even if you go to</v>

3433
02:42:35.961 --> 02:42:36.794
<v Speaker 5>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can see Jordan Peterson smashes </v>

3434
02:42:38.691 --> 02:42:40.970
<v Speaker 5>leftist journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know as a clickbait thing.</v>

3435
02:42:40.971 --> 02:42:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Someone's taken a two minute clip from a</v>
<v Speaker 5>video and they put it out in there using</v>

3436
02:42:44.541 --> 02:42:46.520
<v Speaker 5>that clickbait headlines to attract </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention.</v>

3437
02:42:46.521 --> 02:42:47.354
<v Speaker 5>It's like it does attract attention and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that probably even further as </v>

3438
02:42:49.581 --> 02:42:53.510
<v Speaker 5>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that most people,</v>

3439
02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.460
<v Speaker 5>enough people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the prayer.</v>

3440
02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:56.443
<v Speaker 5>Enough people are going for the long </v>
<v Speaker 5>form thorough discussion so that the </v>

3441
02:43:00.831 --> 02:43:05.390
<v Speaker 5>sensible will will triumph.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm hoping for.</v>

3442
02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:06.950
<v Speaker 5>the sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll try them.</v>

3443
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.823
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree and I think that is what's </v>

3444
02:43:08.611 --> 02:43:12.730
<v Speaker 2>happening and I think that's why this 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>to one number exists is that there,</v>

3445
02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:13.613
<v Speaker 2>but the number one in that 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the $50 versus the 50 people that are </v>

3446
02:43:18.581 --> 02:43:19.414
<v Speaker 2>actually understanding what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and agreeing with you versus the number </v>

3447
02:43:22.091 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 2>one that are trying to willfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent you.</v>

3448
02:43:24.911 --> 02:43:28.930
<v Speaker 2>They still exist and they're loud and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting to be right and this is</v>

3449
02:43:28.931 --> 02:43:30.400
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that people love to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3450
02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:31.653
<v Speaker 2>They love to fight to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of examining their position and </v>

3451
02:43:34.541 --> 02:43:35.374
<v Speaker 2>wondering whether or not they are taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>you out of context and misrepresenting </v>

3452
02:43:38.170 --> 02:43:39.003
<v Speaker 2>your positions to the world willfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing so in order to paint a </v>

3453
02:43:43.001 --> 02:43:46.480
<v Speaker 2>negative picture of you that does not </v>
<v Speaker 2>act accurately represent who you are,</v>

3454
02:43:46.481 --> 02:43:48.970
<v Speaker 2>what you stand for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by doing this,</v>

3455
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:51.490
<v Speaker 2>they're destroying virtue without any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work.</v>

3456
02:43:51.491 --> 02:43:52.930
<v Speaker 2>They're Also destroying their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>credibility.</v>

3457
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.863
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's devastating in there </v>

3458
02:43:56.020 --> 02:43:58.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're killing themselves,</v>

3459
02:43:58.850 --> 02:43:59.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3460
02:43:59.310 --> 02:44:00.390
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a good.</v>

3461
02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:03.610
<v Speaker 5>that's a good motif for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

3462
02:44:03.611 --> 02:44:06.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like try hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hard to when you kill yourself.</v>

3463
02:44:06.781 --> 02:44:08.070
<v Speaker 5>You were talking last night when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

3464
02:44:08.071 --> 02:44:08.904
<v Speaker 5>when we were over dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said that one of the most deadly </v>

3465
02:44:10.501 --> 02:44:13.950
<v Speaker 5>things for a fighter to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>overestimate his his own position.</v>

3466
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Underestimate your abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you overestimate your abilities,</v>

3467
02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:19.160
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3468
02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you're in deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep trouble because you're going to get</v>

3469
02:44:21.471 --> 02:44:22.304
<v Speaker 2>a wake up call and objectivity is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most critical aspects of </v>

3470
02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be.</v>

3471
02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:28.483
<v Speaker 2>You have to be objectively assessing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your strengths and weaknesses at every </v>

3472
02:44:31.821 --> 02:44:32.480
<v Speaker 2>step of the way.</v>

3473
02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Now it's bravo bravado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3474
02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:37.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to prove how am so powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so powerful.</v>

3475
02:44:37.850 --> 02:44:38.683
<v Speaker 2>It's an ego shield and that's why I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that the ego is the enemy we're </v>

3476
02:44:40.991 --> 02:44:41.910
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3477
02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:42.933
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3478
02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to get into this because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

3479
02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a fascinating thing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you personally that your diet,</v>

3480
02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.540
<v Speaker 2>you're on this carnival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3481
02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:53.511
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3482
02:44:53.511 --> 02:44:55.340
<v Speaker 5>So I want to preface that with </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

3483
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:56.383
<v Speaker 5>I am not a dietary expert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I've now speaking as an uninformed </v>

3484
02:44:59.571 --> 02:45:00.220
<v Speaker 5>citizen.</v>

3485
02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:01.053
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is anecdotal evidence from a </v>

3486
02:45:02.761 --> 02:45:06.150
<v Speaker 2>human being is dealt with autoimmune </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues their whole life.</v>

3487
02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have done this for how long now?</v>

3488
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:14.250
<v Speaker 5>I've been on a pure carnivore diet for </v>
<v Speaker 5>about two months and a pretty,</v>

3489
02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:15.393
<v Speaker 5>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very low carb greens only modified </v>

3490
02:45:17.641 --> 02:45:20.230
<v Speaker 5>carnivore diet for about a year.</v>

3491
02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:22.020
<v Speaker 2>so in the year</v>

3492
02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:22.730
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3493
02:45:22.730 --> 02:45:24.370
<v Speaker 5>and the low carb diet for two years </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

3494
02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:27.050
<v Speaker 2>So from the time that I've known you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've known you for what,</v>

3495
02:45:27.051 --> 02:45:28.380
<v Speaker 2>two and a half years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

3496
02:45:28.390 --> 02:45:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first met you,</v>

3497
02:45:29.931 --> 02:45:33.020
<v Speaker 2>you had much more weight on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look different.</v>

3498
02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And you were back then you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>like standard diet,</v>

3499
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.820
<v Speaker 2>normal people guess pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>

3500
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:42.170
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3501
02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:47.030
<v Speaker 2>You shifted over to only meet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>greens.</v>

3502
02:45:47.031 --> 02:45:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I saw you on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3503
02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:49.400
<v Speaker 2>you look fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3504
02:45:49.401 --> 02:45:50.750
<v Speaker 2>whAt are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're lIke,</v>

3505
02:45:50.751 --> 02:45:53.010
<v Speaker 2>I changed my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only meet and greens.</v>

3506
02:45:53.011 --> 02:45:53.811
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3507
02:45:53.811 --> 02:45:54.800
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3508
02:45:54.980 --> 02:45:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3509
02:45:56.391 --> 02:45:57.224
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is cutting out refined</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugars and all these different things </v>

3510
02:45:59.391 --> 02:46:01.850
<v Speaker 2>that are problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preservatives,</v>

3511
02:46:01.851 --> 02:46:02.684
<v Speaker 2>all the bullshit process foods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having this extreme health </v>

3512
02:46:05.211 --> 02:46:06.020
<v Speaker 2>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3513
02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.340
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really excellent.</v>

3514
02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>You're showing great discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you</v>

3515
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.860
<v Speaker 5>decided to take it to another place and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cut out the greens.</v>

3516
02:46:13.310 --> 02:46:15.830
<v Speaker 5>What was the motivation for cutting out </v>
<v Speaker 5>the greens?</v>

3517
02:46:16.050 --> 02:46:16.883
<v Speaker 5>All of the motivation for this has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>my experience with my daughter because </v>

3518
02:46:19.731 --> 02:46:22.190
<v Speaker 5>she has an unbelievably serious </v>
<v Speaker 5>autoimmune disease.</v>

3519
02:46:22.191 --> 02:46:23.810
<v Speaker 5>I just talked to her this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it called?</v>

3520
02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:25.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's arthritis,</v>

3521
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:28.490
<v Speaker 5>but it there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's way more to it than that,</v>

3522
02:46:28.491 --> 02:46:30.800
<v Speaker 5>but the arthritis was the major set of </v>
<v Speaker 5>symptoms.</v>

3523
02:46:30.801 --> 02:46:31.634
<v Speaker 5>She had 40 affected joints and she had </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have her hip replaced and our ankle </v>

3524
02:46:35.001 --> 02:46:37.040
<v Speaker 5>replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When she was 15 and 16,</v>

3525
02:46:37.041 --> 02:46:41.090
<v Speaker 5>and so she basically hobbled around on </v>
<v Speaker 5>two broken legs for two years in extreme</v>

3526
02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:43.540
<v Speaker 5>agony and that was just a tiny fraction </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the,</v>

3527
02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:46.850
<v Speaker 5>of the whole set of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just talked to her this morning.</v>

3528
02:46:46.851 --> 02:46:47.684
<v Speaker 5>She's in chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like she has to have her ankle </v>

3529
02:46:49.401 --> 02:46:52.730
<v Speaker 5>replacement replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's next on the horizon,</v>

3530
02:46:53.020 --> 02:46:53.470
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

3531
02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:55.580
<v Speaker 5>But apart from that she is doing so well</v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

3532
02:46:55.581 --> 02:46:59.390
<v Speaker 5>It is absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she's.</v>

3533
02:46:59.690 --> 02:47:01.310
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's very trIm.</v>

3534
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:03.380
<v Speaker 5>She had a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she's very trim.</v>

3535
02:47:03.381 --> 02:47:05.000
<v Speaker 5>She's down to about 100,</v>
<v Speaker 5>18 pounds.</v>

3536
02:47:05.001 --> 02:47:08.630
<v Speaker 5>She's about five foot six.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's just glowing with health.</v>

3537
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:11.420
<v Speaker 5>All of her autoimmune system symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 5>are gone,</v>

3538
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:14.420
<v Speaker 5>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she was also seriously depressed,</v>

3539
02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:17.300
<v Speaker 5>severely depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way worse than you think.</v>

3540
02:47:17.301 --> 02:47:20.450
<v Speaker 5>She couldn't stay awake for more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>about six hours without taking ritalin.</v>

3541
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:24.920
<v Speaker 5>And she was dying and I had a cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my cousin's daughter,</v>

3542
02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.070
<v Speaker 5>she died when she was 30 from an </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated autoimmune condition.</v>

3543
02:47:29.071 --> 02:47:30.950
<v Speaker 5>So there's a fair bit of this in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>family.</v>

3544
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.903
<v Speaker 5>It was bloody bleak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you and my wife always had a </v>

3545
02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:37.940
<v Speaker 5>suspicion that this was dietary related,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3546
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:38.783
<v Speaker 5>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did notice that when makayla was </v>

3547
02:47:42.471 --> 02:47:45.740
<v Speaker 5>young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she ate oranges or strawberries,</v>

3548
02:47:45.741 --> 02:47:48.140
<v Speaker 5>that she'd get a rash like there were </v>
<v Speaker 5>there were there,</v>

3549
02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:51.650
<v Speaker 5>and then when she developed arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she ate oranges in particular,</v>

3550
02:47:51.651 --> 02:47:52.940
<v Speaker 5>that would definitely cause a flare.</v>

3551
02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:53.773
<v Speaker 5>It waS the only thing we could see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that in order to </v>

3552
02:47:56.571 --> 02:47:57.404
<v Speaker 5>identify a dietary component,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the response has to be pretty quick </v>

3553
02:47:59.631 --> 02:48:01.880
<v Speaker 5>after you eat the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if it's two days later,</v>

3554
02:48:01.881 --> 02:48:03.290
<v Speaker 5>how the hell are you going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>that out?</v>

3555
02:48:03.310 --> 02:48:08.300
<v Speaker 5>A lot of these responses appear to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>delayed for four days and last a month,</v>

3556
02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:10.850
<v Speaker 5>so good luck figuring that out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

3557
02:48:10.851 --> 02:48:13.100
<v Speaker 5>mckayla noticed about three years ago </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

3558
02:48:13.101 --> 02:48:14.600
<v Speaker 5>more than that now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five years ago,</v>

3559
02:48:14.930 --> 02:48:19.340
<v Speaker 5>she was at concordia university and </v>
<v Speaker 5>struggling with her with her illness and</v>

3560
02:48:19.341 --> 02:48:21.350
<v Speaker 5>all the associations associated </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>

3561
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:22.543
<v Speaker 5>She noticed that around exam time she </v>
<v Speaker 5>was starting to develop real skin </v>

3562
02:48:25.611 --> 02:48:26.444
<v Speaker 5>problems and my cousin's daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who I mentioned had really bad skin </v>

3563
02:48:29.991 --> 02:48:30.824
<v Speaker 5>problems and wounds that wouldn't heal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was partly part of the process </v>

3564
02:48:33.321 --> 02:48:35.690
<v Speaker 5>that eventually killed her and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought,</v>

3565
02:48:35.691 --> 02:48:36.800
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it must be stress,</v>

3566
02:48:36.801 --> 02:48:38.150
<v Speaker 5>and then she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a second,</v>

3567
02:48:38.151 --> 02:48:40.130
<v Speaker 5>I really changed my diet when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>studying.</v>

3568
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:43.220
<v Speaker 5>All I do is eat bagels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All I do is eat bread sandwiches.</v>

3569
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:48.250
<v Speaker 5>She thought maybe it's the bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she cut out gluten first and it had a</v>

3570
02:48:49.521 --> 02:48:52.370
<v Speaker 5>remarkable effect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really remarkable effect.</v>

3571
02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:53.533
<v Speaker 5>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she went on a radical elimination diet </v>

3572
02:48:55.551 --> 02:48:56.384
<v Speaker 5>all the way down to nothing but chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>and broccoli and then her symptoms </v>

3573
02:48:58.971 --> 02:49:03.230
<v Speaker 5>started to drop off one by one like and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and like one of the things that happened</v>

3574
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:04.610
<v Speaker 5>is she started to wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>

3575
02:49:04.611 --> 02:49:05.444
<v Speaker 5>She started to be able to stay awake all</v>
<v Speaker 5>day when you're only staying for six </v>

3576
02:49:07.561 --> 02:49:09.660
<v Speaker 5>hours with ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay awake all day.</v>

3577
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:13.980
<v Speaker 5>That's like having a life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so a whole bunch of things improved.</v>

3578
02:49:14.370 --> 02:49:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Their depression went away and I've had </v>
<v Speaker 5>depression since I was 13.</v>

3579
02:49:18.871 --> 02:49:21.870
<v Speaker 5>Probably and very severe and I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>treated it a variety of ways.</v>

3580
02:49:21.871 --> 02:49:22.704
<v Speaker 5>Some of them quite successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's been a constant battle and my </v>

3581
02:49:25.471 --> 02:49:26.304
<v Speaker 5>father had it and his father had it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all just rife in my family and my </v>

3582
02:49:30.061 --> 02:49:31.770
<v Speaker 5>wife has autoimmune problems and hurt.</v>

3583
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:33.150
<v Speaker 5>You say depression?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Define it.</v>

3584
02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you define it?</v>

3585
02:49:36.810 --> 02:49:38.460
<v Speaker 5>Because that's a word that's a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 5>term.</v>

3586
02:49:38.461 --> 02:49:39.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3587
02:49:39.331 --> 02:49:40.164
<v Speaker 5>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that you wake up and that you </v>

3588
02:49:41.311 --> 02:49:44.640
<v Speaker 5>remember that all your family was killed</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a horrible accident yesterday.</v>

3589
02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.860
<v Speaker 5>The you would feel that even if nothing </v>
<v Speaker 5>was wrong.</v>

3590
02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3591
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:50.730
<v Speaker 5>Just just worse than that because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3592
02:49:50.731 --> 02:49:52.800
<v Speaker 5>one of the things mckayla told me what </v>
<v Speaker 5>she thought,</v>

3593
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:54.180
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's it like to be depressed?</v>

3594
02:49:54.390 --> 02:49:55.223
<v Speaker 5>We imagine you have a dog and you really</v>
<v Speaker 5>love the dog and then the dog dies and </v>

3595
02:49:58.321 --> 02:49:59.154
<v Speaker 5>then about two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three years ago our dog died and that </v>

3596
02:50:01.861 --> 02:50:05.850
<v Speaker 5>was mckayla's dog and she really liked </v>
<v Speaker 5>that dog and she said that was bad,</v>

3597
02:50:05.851 --> 02:50:07.740
<v Speaker 5>but it's nowhere near as bad as being </v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed.</v>

3598
02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:09.113
<v Speaker 5>And I asked her to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at one point when she was about 15 or </v>

3599
02:50:10.711 --> 02:50:11.580
<v Speaker 5>16,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3600
02:50:11.581 --> 02:50:13.320
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got a choice kid.</v>

3601
02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:14.273
<v Speaker 5>Here's the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can either have depression or </v>

3602
02:50:16.591 --> 02:50:18.000
<v Speaker 5>arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

3603
02:50:18.001 --> 02:50:18.834
<v Speaker 5>what I'll take the arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that was after she'd lost two </v>

3604
02:50:22.831 --> 02:50:26.760
<v Speaker 5>joints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was no joke.</v>

3605
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:27.870
<v Speaker 5>It's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3606
02:50:27.930 --> 02:50:28.910
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't any.</v>

3607
02:50:29.390 --> 02:50:30.390
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say that.</v>

3608
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:34.290
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say there's nothing worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause worse is a very deep hole.</v>

3609
02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:36.810
<v Speaker 5>But it's bad that people will prove you </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>

3610
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:37.531
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes.</v>

3611
02:50:37.531 --> 02:50:39.570
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Worse squares is a deep hole.</v>

3612
02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:41.400
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her depression went away.</v>

3613
02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:44.280
<v Speaker 5>All of these symptoms went away and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>radically.</v>

3614
02:50:44.310 --> 02:50:47.400
<v Speaker 5>So what changed her from chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 5>broccoli to carnivore?</v>

3615
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>

3616
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:49.483
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she kept experimenting and she got very </v>

3617
02:50:51.571 --> 02:50:54.240
<v Speaker 5>sensitive to all sorts of foods in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>aftermath of that too.</v>

3618
02:50:54.241 --> 02:50:55.074
<v Speaker 5>So this is why I wouldn't recommend that</v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody does this casually because we </v>

3619
02:50:57.631 --> 02:51:00.330
<v Speaker 5>don't understand much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the upshot was that,</v>

3620
02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:01.170
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she kept,</v>

3621
02:51:01.170 --> 02:51:02.003
<v Speaker 5>she kept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she kept experimenting and she started </v>

3622
02:51:04.501 --> 02:51:06.330
<v Speaker 5>to add things back and take them away.</v>

3623
02:51:06.330 --> 02:51:08.820
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes when she added things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the results were devastating.</v>

3624
02:51:08.821 --> 02:51:11.250
<v Speaker 5>She was like done for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She eat the wrong thing,</v>

3625
02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:13.890
<v Speaker 5>done for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the symptoms came back.</v>

3626
02:51:13.891 --> 02:51:14.724
<v Speaker 5>The depression came back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She thought that her whole dietary </v>

3627
02:51:16.711 --> 02:51:18.800
<v Speaker 5>theory was wrong because it lasted so </v>
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

3628
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:22.250
<v Speaker 5>so extreme and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it took her two years to figure out that</v>

3629
02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:25.470
<v Speaker 5>really what she could eat was beef and </v>
<v Speaker 5>greens and then she figured out that she</v>

3630
02:51:25.471 --> 02:51:28.680
<v Speaker 5>could only eat beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So greens themselves.</v>

3631
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:29.461
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

3632
02:51:29.461 --> 02:51:30.450
<v Speaker 5>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Happened.</v>

3633
02:51:30.451 --> 02:51:32.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So two years ago she said,</v>

3634
02:51:32.641 --> 02:51:33.474
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have tried this diet because you </v>

3635
02:51:34.411 --> 02:51:37.650
<v Speaker 5>have a lot of the same symptoms as me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>now I didn't have arthritis,</v>

3636
02:51:37.651 --> 02:51:39.960
<v Speaker 5>but I had a lot of the other symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I thought,</v>

3637
02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:41.940
<v Speaker 5>oh christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay mckayla,</v>

3638
02:51:42.180 --> 02:51:44.100
<v Speaker 5>I can try anything for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

3639
02:51:44.101 --> 02:51:45.420
<v Speaker 5>try it for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

3640
02:51:45.421 --> 02:51:46.170
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3641
02:51:46.170 --> 02:51:48.810
<v Speaker 5>I can hang by my fingernails from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>window sill for a month.</v>

3642
02:51:48.811 --> 02:51:50.910
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just not that big a deal.</v>

3643
02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:53.100
<v Speaker 5>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eliminated.</v>

3644
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:55.230
<v Speaker 5>I went on really low carb diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3645
02:51:55.231 --> 02:51:56.064
<v Speaker 5>so this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had gastric reflux disorder and I was </v>

3646
02:52:00.571 --> 02:52:03.900
<v Speaker 5>snoring quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I stopped snoring the first week.</v>

3647
02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:05.453
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell that supposed to be </v>

3648
02:52:07.061 --> 02:52:09.970
<v Speaker 5>associated with weight loss because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had gained some weight.</v>

3649
02:52:09.971 --> 02:52:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I weighed about 212 pounds and I'm what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>six?</v>

3650
02:52:11.921 --> 02:52:13.570
<v Speaker 5>One and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that was my maximum weight,</v>

3651
02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:15.393
<v Speaker 5>stopped snoring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a great relief to tammy that </v>

3652
02:52:17.381 --> 02:52:18.820
<v Speaker 5>just quit and that's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3653
02:52:18.821 --> 02:52:19.654
<v Speaker 5>Because if you snore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have sleep apnea and then you don't </v>

3654
02:52:20.801 --> 02:52:21.350
<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3655
02:52:21.350 --> 02:52:23.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3656
02:52:23.350 --> 02:52:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Next I started waking up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mornings.</v>

3657
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:28.630
<v Speaker 5>I'd never been able to wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mornings my whole life.</v>

3658
02:52:28.690 --> 02:52:29.523
<v Speaker 5>I always had to stumble to the shower </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then maybe I could wake up and took </v>

3659
02:52:32.411 --> 02:52:35.890
<v Speaker 5>me an hour and I felt terrible and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden I woke up,</v>

3660
02:52:35.891 --> 02:52:36.724
<v Speaker 5>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3661
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.863
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm awake in the morning and I'm </v>

3662
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:41.440
<v Speaker 5>clearheaded and things aren't gloomy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible.</v>

3663
02:52:41.441 --> 02:52:41.981
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3664
02:52:41.981 --> 02:52:45.100
<v Speaker 5>isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I lost seven pounds the first month</v>

3665
02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:46.293
<v Speaker 5>I thought seven pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot in a month and I'd already </v>

3666
02:52:48.671 --> 02:52:49.504
<v Speaker 5>gone for a whole year on a sugar free </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet and I didn't lose any weight and </v>

3667
02:52:51.881 --> 02:52:54.370
<v Speaker 5>I'd been exercised sugar free,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but did you cut out bread?</v>

3668
02:52:54.380 --> 02:52:55.200
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3669
02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:56.860
<v Speaker 5>It was just no desserts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no sugar,</v>

3670
02:52:56.890 --> 02:52:58.090
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I thought that might do.</v>

3671
02:52:58.091 --> 02:53:00.190
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make any difference at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seven pounds.</v>

3672
02:53:01.570 --> 02:53:04.270
<v Speaker 5>Well then then I lost seven pounds in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next month.</v>

3673
02:53:04.580 --> 02:53:07.240
<v Speaker 5>Then I lost seven pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next month I lost seven pounds every</v>

3674
02:53:07.241 --> 02:53:08.260
<v Speaker 5>month for seven months.</v>

3675
02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:09.093
<v Speaker 5>Like I'd throw away all my clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went back to the same weight that I </v>

3676
02:53:10.961 --> 02:53:11.794
<v Speaker 5>was when I was 26 and my psoriasis </v>
<v Speaker 5>disappeared and I had floaters in my </v>

3677
02:53:16.151 --> 02:53:20.410
<v Speaker 5>right eye and they cleared up and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last thing that went away from me,</v>

3678
02:53:20.411 --> 02:53:21.244
<v Speaker 5>I was still having a bitch of a time </v>
<v Speaker 5>with mood regulation and that sucked </v>

3679
02:53:23.321 --> 02:53:24.154
<v Speaker 5>because when I changed my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't respond to antidepressants </v>

3680
02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:26.973
<v Speaker 5>properly anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't working and so although I </v>

3681
02:53:28.841 --> 02:53:31.360
<v Speaker 5>was getting better physically on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>variety of ways,</v>

3682
02:53:31.361 --> 02:53:32.194
<v Speaker 5>like radical ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was really having a bitch of a time </v>

3683
02:53:35.141 --> 02:53:37.270
<v Speaker 5>regulating my mood and I was having </v>
<v Speaker 5>sporadic,</v>

3684
02:53:37.271 --> 02:53:40.480
<v Speaker 5>really negative reactions to food when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>ate something I shouldn't.</v>

3685
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:41.463
<v Speaker 5>So that took about a year and a half to </v>
<v Speaker 5>clear up and I was still really anxious </v>

3686
02:53:43.961 --> 02:53:46.420
<v Speaker 5>in the morning up to three months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like horribly,</v>

3687
02:53:46.421 --> 02:53:47.770
<v Speaker 5>and then it would get better all day.</v>

3688
02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:48.581
<v Speaker 5>People said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3689
02:53:48.581 --> 02:53:49.990
<v Speaker 5>you're under a lot of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>

3690
02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:50.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3691
02:53:50.891 --> 02:53:52.930
<v Speaker 5>I've been under a lot of stress for like</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 years.</v>

3692
02:53:52.931 --> 02:53:53.764
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it Wasn't any more stressful than </v>

3693
02:53:56.261 --> 02:53:57.910
<v Speaker 5>helping my daughter deal with her </v>
<v Speaker 5>illness.</v>

3694
02:53:57.911 --> 02:54:00.130
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is something different.</v>

3695
02:54:00.610 --> 02:54:04.090
<v Speaker 5>and she saId to me quit eating greens </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I thought,</v>

3696
02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:05.800
<v Speaker 5>oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus mckayla,</v>

3697
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:08.530
<v Speaker 5>meeting cucumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lettuce,</v>

3698
02:54:08.770 --> 02:54:12.600
<v Speaker 5>broccoli and chicken and beef.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I have to cut out the god damn</v>

3699
02:54:12.601 --> 02:54:15.010
<v Speaker 5>greens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like try it for a month.</v>

3700
02:54:15.490 --> 02:54:16.323
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Within a week I was 25 percent less </v>

3701
02:54:20.441 --> 02:54:22.030
<v Speaker 5>anxious in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>within two weeks,</v>

3702
02:54:22.031 --> 02:54:24.670
<v Speaker 5>75 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've been better every single day.</v>

3703
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:25.623
<v Speaker 5>I'm better now probably than I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>been in my life and I haven't been </v>

3704
02:54:27.761 --> 02:54:31.420
<v Speaker 5>taking antidepressants for a whole year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know what.</v>

3705
02:54:31.421 --> 02:54:34.570
<v Speaker 5>And I weighed 162 pounds like I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3706
02:54:35.130 --> 02:54:35.963
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm and I've actually gained </v>

3707
02:54:37.091 --> 02:54:37.924
<v Speaker 5>musculature.</v>

3708
02:54:38.350 --> 02:54:40.180
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing some working out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not a lot.</v>

3709
02:54:40.690 --> 02:54:44.170
<v Speaker 5>And so I can sleep six hours a night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>

3710
02:54:44.171 --> 02:54:45.610
<v Speaker 5>I wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm awake.</v>

3711
02:54:45.611 --> 02:54:46.444
<v Speaker 5>If I take a 15 minute nap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That used to take me an hour to recover </v>

3712
02:54:48.521 --> 02:54:49.480
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's gone.</v>

3713
02:54:49.630 --> 02:54:54.010
<v Speaker 5>Here's the coolest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had gum disease since I was 25.</v>

3714
02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:55.033
<v Speaker 5>That's been serious enough to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had to have minor surgical </v>

3715
02:54:57.191 --> 02:54:59.980
<v Speaker 5>intervention scraping and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing to keep it at bay.</v>

3716
02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:01.263
<v Speaker 5>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I checked with my dentist before this </v>

3717
02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:04.790
<v Speaker 5>last tour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no inflammation.</v>

3718
02:55:05.380 --> 02:55:07.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's associated with heart disease</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

3719
02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:08.593
<v Speaker 5>gum inflammation and ginger vidas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a good risk factor for heart </v>

3720
02:55:10.581 --> 02:55:11.414
<v Speaker 5>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means the systemic inflammation is </v>

3721
02:55:12.411 --> 02:55:13.244
<v Speaker 5>gone and it's not supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not supposed to recover from </v>

3722
02:55:15.921 --> 02:55:18.290
<v Speaker 5>ginger bitus have my gums are in perfect</v>
<v Speaker 5>shape.</v>

3723
02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:20.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell?</v>

3724
02:55:20.301 --> 02:55:22.310
<v Speaker 5>So here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost 50 pounds.</v>

3725
02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:25.610
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3726
02:55:26.450 --> 02:55:28.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm nowhere near as hungry as I used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

3727
02:55:28.041 --> 02:55:29.960
<v Speaker 5>My appetite's probably fallen by 70 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>

3728
02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:33.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't get blood sugar dysregulation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Problems.</v>

3729
02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:37.760
<v Speaker 5>I need way less sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get up in the morning and I'm fine.</v>

3730
02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:39.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not depressed.</v>

3731
02:55:39.261 --> 02:55:42.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't have psoriasis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My legs were numb on the sides.</v>

3732
02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:43.843
<v Speaker 5>That's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly intellectually at my best </v>

3733
02:55:49.241 --> 02:55:50.740
<v Speaker 5>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a great relief.</v>

3734
02:55:50.741 --> 02:55:53.530
<v Speaker 5>Especially doing this tour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Depression is gone.</v>

3735
02:55:55.450 --> 02:55:57.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can swim better</v>

3736
02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:02.870
<v Speaker 2>and my gum disease is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3737
02:56:02.871 --> 02:56:04.520
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've done.</v>

3738
02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:08.680
<v Speaker 2>You've done no blood work so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what your lippert lipid profile is.</v>

3739
02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:10.190
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get that done again when I go back.</v>

3740
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Take any vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3741
02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:14.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat beef and salt and water.</v>

3742
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:17.660
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I never cheat ever.</v>

3743
02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Not even a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No soda,</v>

3744
02:56:19.821 --> 02:56:23.440
<v Speaker 2>no wine drink club soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's done.</v>

3745
02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It's still water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3746
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're down to that level </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3747
02:56:26.721 --> 02:56:27.554
<v Speaker 2>it's not joe joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's there's club soda which is </v>

3748
02:56:30.411 --> 02:56:32.030
<v Speaker 2>really bubbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's perrier,</v>

3749
02:56:32.031 --> 02:56:35.030
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of bubbly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's flatwater and there's hot water.</v>

3750
02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Those distinctions start to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

3751
02:56:38.890 --> 02:56:41.900
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy where we ate last night and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ate what you ate.</v>

3752
02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We both had that giant tomahawk.</v>

3753
02:56:45.610 --> 02:56:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I had wine though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3754
02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious about thIs.</v>

3755
02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm very curious to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I eat a lot of vegetables,</v>

3756
02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:56.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have any problems like </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

3757
02:56:56.660 --> 02:56:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Hey man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm not a disclaimer.</v>

3758
02:56:59.571 --> 02:57:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am not recommending this to anyone.</v>

3759
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:04.100
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have had,</v>

3760
02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:06.170
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have had many,</v>

3761
02:57:06.171 --> 02:57:09.230
<v Speaker 5>many people come up to me on the tour </v>
<v Speaker 5>and say,</v>

3762
02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:11.120
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been following your daughter's blog</v>

3763
02:57:11.390 --> 02:57:14.710
<v Speaker 5>and I've lost 100 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what?</v>

3764
02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:17.720
<v Speaker 5>you lost a hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost a hundred pounds in six months.</v>

3765
02:57:17.721 --> 02:57:20.180
<v Speaker 5>I talked to a woman yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She lost 15 pounds in one month.</v>

3766
02:57:20.181 --> 02:57:22.160
<v Speaker 5>She was 70.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3767
02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:25.610
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a question.</v>

3768
02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:27.800
<v Speaker 5>Why is everyone fat and stupid?</v>

3769
02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:30.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3770
02:57:31.180 --> 02:57:33.030
<v Speaker 2>because it's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

3771
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:34.191
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

3772
02:57:34.191 --> 02:57:35.024
<v Speaker 5>It's new and it's not sedentary </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifestyle that that hypothesis doesn't </v>

3773
02:57:38.661 --> 02:57:39.494
<v Speaker 5>seem to hold water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something wrong with the way </v>

3774
02:57:41.271 --> 02:57:42.104
<v Speaker 5>we're eating and the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong is that we're eating way </v>

3775
02:57:43.791 --> 02:57:45.740
<v Speaker 5>too many carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

3776
02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:47.393
<v Speaker 2>no expat shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elimination of most carbohydrates </v>

3777
02:57:50.231 --> 02:57:51.064
<v Speaker 2>lives made a big shift in my life and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do cheat occasionally with bread and </v>

3778
02:57:55.331 --> 02:57:56.164
<v Speaker 2>occasionally with pasta I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will go off with ice cream and things </v>

3779
02:57:59.981 --> 02:58:00.814
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time I'm just eating </v>

3780
02:58:03.721 --> 02:58:07.680
<v Speaker 2>meat and vegetables most of the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll have a cheat day,</v>

3781
02:58:07.681 --> 02:58:10.860
<v Speaker 2>like once a week or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if I go to dinner,</v>

3782
02:58:10.861 --> 02:58:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a little pasta and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to mess me up too bad,</v>

3783
02:58:14.371 --> 02:58:18.990
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel shitty after I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like for simple mouth pleasure.</v>

3784
02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowing myself to feel tired </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

3785
02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:23.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big one man.</v>

3786
02:58:24.110 --> 02:58:25.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like I.</v>

3787
02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:26.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well really I.</v>

3788
02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.333
<v Speaker 5>And it's so interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I can't believe I can wake up in </v>

3789
02:58:32.091 --> 02:58:32.924
<v Speaker 5>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get that's never happened to me in my </v>

3790
02:58:34.851 --> 02:58:37.190
<v Speaker 5>whole life in when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>13,</v>

3791
02:58:37.280 --> 02:58:38.113
<v Speaker 5>12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had a bitch of a time waking up in the </v>

3792
02:58:39.501 --> 02:58:41.180
<v Speaker 5>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just brutal.</v>

3793
02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:43.700
<v Speaker 5>I just thought that's how it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what</v>

3794
02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:44.613
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3795
02:58:44.660 --> 02:58:45.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a nutritionist either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's fascinating to me is I </v>

3796
02:58:48.231 --> 02:58:51.170
<v Speaker 2>haven't heard any negative stories about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing this.</v>

3797
02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:53.950
<v Speaker 5>Have a negative story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3798
02:58:54.310 --> 02:58:55.143
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that both mckayla and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed was that when we restricted </v>

3799
02:58:59.621 --> 02:59:02.320
<v Speaker 5>our diet and then eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we weren't supposed to,</v>

3800
02:59:02.321 --> 02:59:06.370
<v Speaker 5>the reaction to eating what we weren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to was absolutely catastrophic.</v>

3801
02:59:06.930 --> 02:59:07.763
<v Speaker 5>Would it show?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did you switch to or what did you </v>

3802
02:59:09.221 --> 02:59:10.160
<v Speaker 5>eat rather?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3803
02:59:10.570 --> 02:59:11.403
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst response I think we're </v>

3804
02:59:12.371 --> 02:59:14.590
<v Speaker 5>allergic to or allergic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell this is.</v>

3805
02:59:14.591 --> 02:59:15.424
<v Speaker 5>Having an inflammatory response to </v>
<v Speaker 5>something called sulfites and we had </v>

3806
02:59:19.001 --> 02:59:22.540
<v Speaker 5>some apple cider that had sulfites in it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was really not good.</v>

3807
02:59:22.541 --> 02:59:23.374
<v Speaker 5>Like I was done for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the first time I talked to sam </v>

3808
02:59:25.541 --> 02:59:27.280
<v Speaker 5>harris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were done for a month.</v>

3809
02:59:27.370 --> 02:59:28.660
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took me out for a month.</v>

3810
02:59:28.661 --> 02:59:30.040
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3811
02:59:30.041 --> 02:59:30.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3812
02:59:30.810 --> 02:59:35.180
<v Speaker 2>So and so this is right before this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole truth conversation with sam harris</v>

3813
02:59:35.181 --> 02:59:36.240
<v Speaker 2>had dirt and the mud</v>

3814
02:59:36.670 --> 02:59:40.560
<v Speaker 5>during the day I talked to sam was like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst day of my life,</v>

3815
02:59:40.740 --> 02:59:43.830
<v Speaker 5>not because of talking to sam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was just physical.</v>

3816
02:59:43.831 --> 02:59:45.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was so dead,</v>

3817
02:59:45.331 --> 02:59:48.200
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't want to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because cider like,</v>

3818
02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:49.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was it fights in?</v>

3819
02:59:49.530 --> 02:59:51.320
<v Speaker 5>What was it doing to you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh it,</v>

3820
02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:52.173
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It produced an overwhelming sense of </v>

3821
02:59:54.421 --> 02:59:57.780
<v Speaker 5>impending doom and I seriously been </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming,</v>

3822
02:59:57.810 --> 02:59:58.643
<v Speaker 5>like there's no way I could've lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that if that would have lasted for </v>

3823
03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:03.180
<v Speaker 5>seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mckayla knew by that point that it would</v>

3824
03:00:03.181 --> 03:00:08.181
<v Speaker 5>probably only last a month and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a month to month fucking cider or I</v>

3825
03:00:08.311 --> 03:00:11.610
<v Speaker 5>didn't sleep that month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't sleep for 25 days.</v>

3826
03:00:11.970 --> 03:00:14.850
<v Speaker 5>I didn't sleep at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't sleep at all for 25 days.</v>

3827
03:00:14.851 --> 03:00:16.670
<v Speaker 5>How that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The all county,</v>

3828
03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:17.513
<v Speaker 5>how it's possible you lay in bed frozen </v>
<v Speaker 5>in something approximating terror for </v>

3829
03:00:22.111 --> 03:00:23.460
<v Speaker 5>eight hours and then you get up.</v>

3830
03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3831
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:28.170
<v Speaker 5>This is some fucking cider from sites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we thought,</v>

3832
03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:30.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean look again,</v>

3833
03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:33.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the hell I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3834
03:00:33.630 --> 03:00:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is all a mystery to me.</v>

3835
03:00:35.940 --> 03:00:37.860
<v Speaker 5>The fact that my daughter was so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3836
03:00:37.861 --> 03:00:38.694
<v Speaker 5>the one thing that I did know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I scoured the literature on </v>

3837
03:00:40.501 --> 03:00:44.280
<v Speaker 5>arthritis when she was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the scientific literature and because we</v>

3838
03:00:44.281 --> 03:00:45.114
<v Speaker 5>were interested in the dietary </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection and the only thing I could </v>

3839
03:00:47.101 --> 03:00:50.730
<v Speaker 5>find that was reliable was that if </v>
<v Speaker 5>people with arthritis fasted,</v>

3840
03:00:51.150 --> 03:00:51.983
<v Speaker 5>their symptoms reliably went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's actually a well documented </v>

3841
03:00:54.511 --> 03:00:55.344
<v Speaker 5>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then if they started to eat again </v>

3842
03:00:57.930 --> 03:00:59.500
<v Speaker 5>and there was symptoms came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

3843
03:00:59.501 --> 03:01:00.334
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell does it not matter what </v>

3844
03:01:02.381 --> 03:01:04.810
<v Speaker 5>they eat?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't be reactive to everything.</v>

3845
03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:06.970
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3846
03:01:06.971 --> 03:01:07.804
<v Speaker 5>but they can be reactive to almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything and the difference between </v>

3847
03:01:10.871 --> 03:01:12.220
<v Speaker 5>everything and almost everything.</v>

3848
03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:13.083
<v Speaker 5>That's a big difference and so mckayla </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems to be maybe me too and tammy's on </v>

3849
03:01:17.471 --> 03:01:18.304
<v Speaker 5>the same diet because she has autoimmune</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems on her side of the family and </v>

3850
03:01:20.521 --> 03:01:22.330
<v Speaker 5>so mckayla seemed to inherit all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3851
03:01:22.570 --> 03:01:24.550
<v Speaker 5>Your skin looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh jesus.</v>

3852
03:01:24.551 --> 03:01:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm waiting you.</v>

3853
03:01:26.770 --> 03:01:30.010
<v Speaker 5>You look like more vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange.</v>

3854
03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:35.360
<v Speaker 5>You're welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but my point is you're saying that there</v>

3855
03:01:35.361 --> 03:01:37.960
<v Speaker 5>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is problems with his diet,</v>

3856
03:01:37.961 --> 03:01:39.620
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't seem to be a problem </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the dyads.</v>

3857
03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:40.473
<v Speaker 5>He was a problem with deviating from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>diet that your body becomes accustomed </v>

3858
03:01:43.001 --> 03:01:43.571
<v Speaker 5>with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3859
03:01:43.571 --> 03:01:46.300
<v Speaker 5>one of the hypothesis that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>pursuing,</v>

3860
03:01:46.301 --> 03:01:49.060
<v Speaker 5>and there's some justification for this </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the scientific literature,</v>

3861
03:01:49.061 --> 03:01:49.894
<v Speaker 5>is that the reason that you lay on </v>
<v Speaker 5>layers of fat because the fat acts as a </v>

3862
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:54.663
<v Speaker 5>buffer between you and the toxic things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're eating because fat is </v>

3863
03:01:57.461 --> 03:01:58.210
<v Speaker 5>actually an organ.</v>

3864
03:01:58.210 --> 03:02:02.050
<v Speaker 5>It has functions other than merely the </v>
<v Speaker 5>storage of of of calories,</v>

3865
03:02:02.350 --> 03:02:04.870
<v Speaker 5>and maybe when you strip out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>protective layer,</v>

3866
03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:07.450
<v Speaker 5>then you're more sensitive to what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be eating.</v>

3867
03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:10.150
<v Speaker 5>This is all speculative hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3868
03:02:10.450 --> 03:02:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe you sensitize yourself by </v>
<v Speaker 5>removing it from your constant diet.</v>

3869
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:15.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't bloody well know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3870
03:02:15.551 --> 03:02:16.384
<v Speaker 5>I would think it would be much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>likely that because you think about </v>

3871
03:02:18.281 --> 03:02:21.310
<v Speaker 5>people who are alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they develop a tolerance to alcohol.</v>

3872
03:02:21.311 --> 03:02:24.850
<v Speaker 5>You get off of that and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>drink and your tolerances are shot,</v>

3873
03:02:24.851 --> 03:02:28.340
<v Speaker 5>and then you immediately have a adverse </v>
<v Speaker 5>reaction to the alcohol.</v>

3874
03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people do it all the time,</v>

3875
03:02:31.730 --> 03:02:33.340
<v Speaker 5>your body becomes tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3876
03:02:33.341 --> 03:02:34.174
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the layering of fat on </v>

3877
03:02:36.341 --> 03:02:38.650
<v Speaker 5>might be part of the tolerance </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism,</v>

3878
03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:41.770
<v Speaker 5>so it's not merely a matter of caloric </v>
<v Speaker 5>intake.</v>

3879
03:02:41.771 --> 03:02:44.530
<v Speaker 5>It's a matter of of toxic caloric </v>
<v Speaker 5>intake,</v>

3880
03:02:44.590 --> 03:02:48.610
<v Speaker 5>buffered by whatever it is that fat is </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing as a neuroendocrin Oregon.</v>

3881
03:02:49.330 --> 03:02:50.360
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

3882
03:02:50.361 --> 03:02:52.500
<v Speaker 5>I said I'm out of my depth here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3883
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:53.343
<v Speaker 5>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone's out of their depth that god </v>

3884
03:02:55.261 --> 03:02:58.000
<v Speaker 5>damn food pyramid was made by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>department of agriculture,</v>

3885
03:02:58.001 --> 03:02:58.834
<v Speaker 5>not the department of health.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't predicated on any scientific </v>

3886
03:03:00.851 --> 03:03:02.420
<v Speaker 5>studies whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should have,</v>

3887
03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:05.230
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't be eating massive </v>
<v Speaker 5>quantities of corn syrup.</v>

3888
03:03:05.231 --> 03:03:06.064
<v Speaker 5>We eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we eat way too many carbohydrates with </v>

3889
03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:12.130
<v Speaker 5>mckayla posted a paper the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a doctor,</v>

3890
03:03:12.131 --> 03:03:12.964
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>successfully treated type one diabetes </v>

3891
03:03:14.231 --> 03:03:18.040
<v Speaker 5>with a carnivore diet type one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not type two.</v>

3892
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:21.330
<v Speaker 5>So that's bloody impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3893
03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:22.213
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very curious to me because you're </v>

3894
03:03:24.881 --> 03:03:25.714
<v Speaker 5>talking about one adverse reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is when you deviated from the </v>

3895
03:03:28.361 --> 03:03:29.194
<v Speaker 5>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm talking about is when I read </v>

3896
03:03:30.761 --> 03:03:35.761
<v Speaker 5>people's accounts of trying this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost universally positive,</v>

3897
03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:37.550
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a problem.</v>

3898
03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably anecdote,</v>

3899
03:03:39.671 --> 03:03:40.171
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3900
03:03:40.171 --> 03:03:43.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure and it's the same with all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these stories that I'm collecting as I'm</v>

3901
03:03:43.961 --> 03:03:45.820
<v Speaker 5>touring people.</v>

3902
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:47.440
<v Speaker 5>Lots of people have come up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3903
03:03:47.441 --> 03:03:48.274
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost 45 pounds in the last three </v>

3904
03:03:49.241 --> 03:03:50.630
<v Speaker 5>months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

3905
03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's shocking to me.</v>

3906
03:03:52.991 --> 03:03:53.824
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3907
03:03:54.270 --> 03:03:55.210
<v Speaker 5>what do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And say,</v>

3908
03:03:55.211 --> 03:03:56.110
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it.</v>

3909
03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:57.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who can all couldn't believe it?</v>

3910
03:03:58.280 --> 03:03:59.750
<v Speaker 5>50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3911
03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:02.180
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know I had 50 pounds to lose,</v>

3912
03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:03.133
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I was maybe 20 pounds heavier </v>

3913
03:04:04.371 --> 03:04:06.170
<v Speaker 5>than I should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should have been won 85,</v>

3914
03:04:06.171 --> 03:04:09.410
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Guess that's 25 to 30 pounds.</v>

3915
03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:11.420
<v Speaker 5>That was the maximum I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3916
03:04:11.421 --> 03:04:11.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost.</v>

3917
03:04:11.991 --> 03:04:15.080
<v Speaker 5>I met one 62 and I was at 2:12.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's that?</v>

3918
03:04:16.340 --> 03:04:19.280
<v Speaker 5>50 50 balance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has a lot of weight.</v>

3919
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:21.440
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I threw all my clothes away.</v>

3920
03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:23.960
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe it.</v>

3921
03:04:24.010 --> 03:04:25.520
<v Speaker 5>When I was nine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3922
03:04:25.521 --> 03:04:26.660
<v Speaker 5>you're so slim.</v>

3923
03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:27.793
<v Speaker 5>Like your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your stomach is completely flat and </v>

3924
03:04:29.901 --> 03:04:31.100
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is not a lean,</v>

3925
03:04:31.101 --> 03:04:35.480
<v Speaker 5>mean fighting man in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not a an exercise fanatic.</v>

3926
03:04:35.481 --> 03:04:38.040
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're starving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're going,</v>

3927
03:04:38.050 --> 03:04:38.883
<v Speaker 5>I'm not having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing I should say to </v>

3928
03:04:40.281 --> 03:04:42.650
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to try a diet like this,</v>

3929
03:04:43.220 --> 03:04:45.620
<v Speaker 5>you eat enough meat and fat so you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>not hungry.</v>

3930
03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't get hungry.</v>

3931
03:04:47.450 --> 03:04:48.800
<v Speaker 5>You're not eating enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're hungry,</v>

3932
03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:50.083
<v Speaker 5>if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to cheat and it's gonna </v>

3933
03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:51.913
<v Speaker 5>drive you stark raving mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that was really cool is </v>

3934
03:04:54.111 --> 03:04:55.490
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really liked sweets,</v>

3935
03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:58.370
<v Speaker 5>like I've kind of lived on peanut butter</v>
<v Speaker 5>sandwiches and chocolate milk.</v>

3936
03:04:58.430 --> 03:04:59.480
<v Speaker 5>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really,</v>

3937
03:04:59.750 --> 03:05:01.490
<v Speaker 5>but that was my go to food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3938
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:06.910
<v Speaker 5>both of which were terrible for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but after I stopped eating carbohydrates</v>

3939
03:05:07.371 --> 03:05:10.250
<v Speaker 5>for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the carbohydrate cravings went away.</v>

3940
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:12.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>last night when we were out for dinner,</v>

3941
03:05:12.351 --> 03:05:13.184
<v Speaker 5>somebody ordered bread pudding and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloody love bread pudding with caramel </v>

3942
03:05:15.801 --> 03:05:16.634
<v Speaker 5>and ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was sitting there and I could </v>

3943
03:05:18.171 --> 03:05:22.370
<v Speaker 5>smell it and I thought I could go all </v>
<v Speaker 5>fantastic Mr.</v>

3944
03:05:22.370 --> 03:05:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Fox on that bread pudding and just tear </v>
<v Speaker 5>it down in about 15 seconds,</v>

3945
03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:27.253
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't as intense as a craving for a </v>

3946
03:05:29.001 --> 03:05:32.330
<v Speaker 5>cigarette if you're next ex smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like be really nice to eat that.</v>

3947
03:05:32.660 --> 03:05:36.050
<v Speaker 5>But like my appetite declined by about </v>
<v Speaker 5>75 percent.</v>

3948
03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:37.700
<v Speaker 5>That's been permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's been.</v>

3949
03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:38.563
<v Speaker 5>So there's a perverse thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I eat way less and now I'm not as </v>

3950
03:05:41.301 --> 03:05:43.160
<v Speaker 5>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3951
03:05:43.570 --> 03:05:44.990
<v Speaker 5>Well how does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3952
03:05:44.991 --> 03:05:45.824
<v Speaker 5>you're not eating way less eating way </v>
<v Speaker 5>less thing because you had a 30 ounce </v>

3953
03:05:48.921 --> 03:05:49.970
<v Speaker 5>steak last night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

3954
03:05:49.971 --> 03:05:50.640
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3955
03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:53.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing my best not to be hungry.</v>

3956
03:05:53.210 --> 03:05:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Although it didn't look like it was $30.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3957
03:05:55.100 --> 03:05:56.030
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3958
03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:57.710
<v Speaker 5>It was a small 30 state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3959
03:05:57.711 --> 03:05:59.780
<v Speaker 5>I think it starts out 30 ounces before </v>
<v Speaker 5>they cook.</v>

3960
03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:01.820
<v Speaker 5>It loses a considerable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3961
03:06:02.020 --> 03:06:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Very fatty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3962
03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:07.070
<v Speaker 5>But that's the other thing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You must have to get a lot of fat.</v>

3963
03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:08.343
<v Speaker 5>I eat fatty cuts of steak and mckayla is</v>
<v Speaker 5>buying directly from the butcher store </v>

3964
03:06:12.591 --> 03:06:13.424
<v Speaker 5>and we cook that up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut it into small pieces and fried up </v>

3965
03:06:15.401 --> 03:06:16.680
<v Speaker 5>until it's crispy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3966
03:06:16.690 --> 03:06:20.810
<v Speaker 5>It's actually quite delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not bread pudding with ice cream,</v>

3967
03:06:20.811 --> 03:06:22.690
<v Speaker 5>but it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean daniel?</v>

3968
03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:23.840
<v Speaker 5>It's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to.</v>

3969
03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:24.913
<v Speaker 5>I want your blood profile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to find out what's going on with </v>

3970
03:06:26.961 --> 03:06:27.794
<v Speaker 5>you because one of the big myths,</v>
<v Speaker 5>misconceptions when it comes to </v>

3971
03:06:30.081 --> 03:06:30.914
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol and saturated fat and food </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that if you eat dietary cholesterol </v>

3972
03:06:35.001 --> 03:06:37.280
<v Speaker 5>that it affects your blood cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>

3973
03:06:37.280 --> 03:06:40.160
<v Speaker 5>It's not super common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Misconceptions.</v>

3974
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Well those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the thing about clinical studies with</v>

3975
03:06:42.621 --> 03:06:45.500
<v Speaker 5>diet are virtually impossible to conduct</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you just can't.</v>

3976
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:50.710
<v Speaker 5>you can't conduct a proper randomly </v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed controlled experiment is too</v>

3977
03:06:50.781 --> 03:06:51.614
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of what we're trying to do is </v>

3978
03:06:52.581 --> 03:06:55.150
<v Speaker 5>pull out information from correlations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3979
03:06:55.490 --> 03:06:56.323
<v Speaker 5>He can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the real problems with </v>

3980
03:06:57.840 --> 03:06:58.673
<v Speaker 5>correlating meet with cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>diabetes and all these different </v>

3981
03:07:01.711 --> 03:07:04.320
<v Speaker 5>diseases is because people are eating a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of shit with that.</v>

3982
03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:05.663
<v Speaker 5>They have different lifestyle profile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's just endless numbers of </v>

3983
03:07:08.701 --> 03:07:12.440
<v Speaker 5>confounding variables and you only need </v>
<v Speaker 5>one confounding variable that's,</v>

3984
03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:13.333
<v Speaker 5>that's relevant to screw up the study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't get that information with </v>

3985
03:07:16.321 --> 03:07:19.170
<v Speaker 5>correlational studies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We try because it's impossible to do the</v>

3986
03:07:19.171 --> 03:07:21.060
<v Speaker 5>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how many people were incredulous?</v>

3987
03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:22.363
<v Speaker 5>We went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how manY people when they're hearing </v>

3988
03:07:23.701 --> 03:07:25.230
<v Speaker 5>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>

3989
03:07:26.780 --> 03:07:27.900
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while you are not,</v>

3990
03:07:27.901 --> 03:07:29.430
<v Speaker 5>but you know you're interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of thing,</v>

3991
03:07:29.431 --> 03:07:30.630
<v Speaker 5>but they should be incredulous.</v>

3992
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Like when people make absurd claims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

3993
03:07:32.640 --> 03:07:33.473
<v Speaker 5>oh well I had 50 health problems and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped eating everything but meat and </v>

3994
03:07:35.970 --> 03:07:36.840
<v Speaker 5>they went away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3995
03:07:36.841 --> 03:07:38.160
<v Speaker 5>oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3996
03:07:38.161 --> 03:07:38.994
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it wasn't you dying so and I see </v>

3997
03:07:43.351 --> 03:07:44.184
<v Speaker 5>the results and I know it's an anecdote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bloody will understand that and I'm </v>

3998
03:07:46.891 --> 03:07:47.724
<v Speaker 5>highly skeptical about all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm telling you so that's why I'm </v>

3999
03:07:50.371 --> 03:07:51.204
<v Speaker 5>telling you what happened to me and what</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened to my daughter and also what </v>

4000
03:07:52.891 --> 03:07:56.430
<v Speaker 5>happened to my wife because she's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tammy was always in good shape and she's</v>

4001
03:07:56.431 --> 03:08:01.431
<v Speaker 5>exercised a lot and she reduced to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the pure carnivore died about a month</v>

4002
03:08:02.490 --> 03:08:03.323
<v Speaker 5>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She lost like 12 pounds and she was </v>

4003
03:08:05.281 --> 03:08:06.114
<v Speaker 5>already slim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's back to the same way she was when </v>

4004
03:08:07.861 --> 03:08:10.270
<v Speaker 5>she was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

4005
03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:13.080
<v Speaker 5>she's like 58,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4006
03:08:13.290 --> 03:08:15.420
<v Speaker 5>and she doesn't look 58.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you that.</v>

4007
03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:19.530
<v Speaker 5>So it's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really fascinating because I just,</v>

4008
03:08:19.531 --> 03:08:20.364
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a person who studied diet for many </v>

4009
03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:25.673
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would assume that you need fido </v>

4010
03:08:26.721 --> 03:08:27.554
<v Speaker 5>nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would assume that you need vitamin </v>

4011
03:08:29.391 --> 03:08:30.224
<v Speaker 5>supplements like vitamin c for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turns out if you don't eat </v>

4012
03:08:32.371 --> 03:08:34.140
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't need vitamin c.</v>

4013
03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:35.330
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who would have guessed?</v>

4014
03:08:35.370 --> 03:08:37.020
<v Speaker 5>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

4015
03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:39.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember mckayla outline to </v>
<v Speaker 5>paper.</v>

4016
03:08:39.151 --> 03:08:42.600
<v Speaker 5>For me vitamin c is necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrate metabolism,</v>

4017
03:08:42.810 --> 03:08:44.730
<v Speaker 5>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if again,</v>

4018
03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:47.910
<v Speaker 5>remember everyone listening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am not an expert in this field,</v>

4019
03:08:48.750 --> 03:08:49.770
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4020
03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:50.753
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I want you to get your blood tested </v>

4021
03:08:52.470 --> 03:08:53.280
<v Speaker 5>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4022
03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.640
<v Speaker 5>if be pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was in good shape,</v>

4023
03:08:56.730 --> 03:08:57.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be.</v>

4024
03:08:58.530 --> 03:09:01.080
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to find out what your nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels are and where they're coming.</v>

4025
03:09:01.090 --> 03:09:01.651
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4026
03:09:01.651 --> 03:09:02.470
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

4027
03:09:02.470 --> 03:09:03.303
<v Speaker 5>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting a little getting a little </v>

4028
03:09:04.321 --> 03:09:05.154
<v Speaker 5>cramping in my toes from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not sure about potassium or </v>

4029
03:09:08.071 --> 03:09:08.700
<v Speaker 5>magnesium.</v>

4030
03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:11.520
<v Speaker 5>That's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how the supplement.</v>

4031
03:09:11.850 --> 03:09:14.160
<v Speaker 5>It's very easy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why I'm concerned about.</v>

4032
03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:15.313
<v Speaker 5>And also minerals and certain minerals </v>
<v Speaker 5>You're getting from vegetables that </v>

4033
03:09:18.751 --> 03:09:20.370
<v Speaker 5>you're probably not getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4034
03:09:20.610 --> 03:09:22.410
<v Speaker 5>Well this is all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4035
03:09:22.411 --> 03:09:24.450
<v Speaker 5>it seems hard to supplement that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

4036
03:09:24.451 --> 03:09:25.980
<v Speaker 5>Colloidal minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4037
03:09:25.981 --> 03:09:28.500
<v Speaker 5>there's some mineral pills you can take </v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty of.</v>

4038
03:09:28.580 --> 03:09:29.413
<v Speaker 5>Well there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are people who basically lived on </v>

4039
03:09:31.381 --> 03:09:32.760
<v Speaker 5>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4040
03:09:32.761 --> 03:09:36.420
<v Speaker 5>the inuit did was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I basically did some supplementation,</v>

4041
03:09:36.421 --> 03:09:37.680
<v Speaker 5>but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4042
03:09:38.430 --> 03:09:40.260
<v Speaker 5>And apparently if you do a carnivore </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet,</v>

4043
03:09:40.261 --> 03:09:42.630
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to eat more organ meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I do some of that,</v>

4044
03:09:42.631 --> 03:09:45.150
<v Speaker 5>but not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I can tell you like I'm,</v>

4045
03:09:45.450 --> 03:09:47.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well look,</v>

4046
03:09:47.611 --> 03:09:50.370
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>producing positive results.</v>

4047
03:09:50.580 --> 03:09:53.350
<v Speaker 5>It's not like it's fun for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4048
03:09:53.351 --> 03:09:57.250
<v Speaker 5>it makes you a social pariah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's invite the peterson's over.</v>

4049
03:09:57.310 --> 03:09:58.720
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't eat anything.</v>

4050
03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:00.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have other friends.</v>

4051
03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:02.110
<v Speaker 5>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's how it works.</v>

4052
03:10:02.111 --> 03:10:04.000
<v Speaker 5>It's not malevolence right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a fear,</v>

4053
03:10:04.001 --> 03:10:06.130
<v Speaker 5>a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one invites you out and so.</v>

4054
03:10:06.430 --> 03:10:10.220
<v Speaker 5>So I'm a social pain in an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 5>pain and now I'm a nutritional paints.</v>

4055
03:10:10.770 --> 03:10:11.603
<v Speaker 5>No friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How difficult is it when you're trying </v>

4056
03:10:13.241 --> 03:10:15.970
<v Speaker 5>to get breakfast?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you do when you.</v>

4057
03:10:16.330 --> 03:10:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lots of times when we traveling we cook,</v>

4058
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:21.890
<v Speaker 5>so we usually stay in places where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can cook,</v>

4059
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:23.503
<v Speaker 5>but most places you can get a steak and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's mostly what we do when </v>

4060
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.943
<v Speaker 5>traveling in a motor home and so we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been cooking in the motorhome and so </v>

4061
03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:33.410
<v Speaker 5>carrie beef jerky with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we make,</v>

4062
03:10:33.690 --> 03:10:36.050
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

4063
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:37.543
<v Speaker 5>You make your own beef jerky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a dehydrator and you just </v>

4064
03:10:40.311 --> 03:10:42.590
<v Speaker 5>basically put salt on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throw it in the dehydrator.</v>

4065
03:10:42.591 --> 03:10:46.820
<v Speaker 5>so that works pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You anticipate continuing this?</v>

4066
03:10:47.970 --> 03:10:50.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember god forever is a long time.</v>

4067
03:10:50.551 --> 03:10:51.384
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to be able to eat more things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to experiment with that </v>

4068
03:10:53.971 --> 03:10:54.661
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

4069
03:10:54.661 --> 03:10:55.291
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

4070
03:10:55.291 --> 03:10:56.124
<v Speaker 5>very cautiously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to add mushrooms next because </v>

4071
03:10:58.590 --> 03:11:01.590
<v Speaker 5>maybe I could eat them well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why I'm asking.</v>

4072
03:11:01.980 --> 03:11:02.813
<v Speaker 5>There's</v>

4073
03:11:02.980 --> 03:11:03.813
<v Speaker 2>positive benefits that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve and experience when they </v>

4074
03:11:07.271 --> 03:11:08.104
<v Speaker 2>switched to a vegan diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things it is as you get off of the </v>

4075
03:11:10.961 --> 03:11:11.794
<v Speaker 2>standard american diet with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>refined sugars and preservatives and </v>

4076
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:20.470
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you find positive benefits.</v>

4077
03:11:20.471 --> 03:11:22.480
<v Speaker 2>chris kresser has gone into depth about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4078
03:11:22.481 --> 03:11:23.314
<v Speaker 2>but then over time to nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies in that start to wear on </v>

4079
03:11:28.301 --> 03:11:30.910
<v Speaker 2>your health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wondering,</v>

4080
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:33.860
<v Speaker 5>certainly possible while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4081
03:11:33.861 --> 03:11:35.960
<v Speaker 5>certainly eventually this diet will kill</v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

4082
03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:40.610
<v Speaker 5>No life will well near right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Biology will,</v>

4083
03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:42.050
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And less so in science.</v>

4084
03:11:42.051 --> 03:11:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Intervenes might be for some people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vegan diet or vegan diet.</v>

4085
03:11:46.341 --> 03:11:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Is it preferable to a standard american </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet?</v>

4086
03:11:50.060 --> 03:11:50.840
<v Speaker 5>For sure,</v>

4087
03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:51.673
<v Speaker 2>to a standard american diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also there's so much biological </v>

4088
03:11:53.931 --> 03:11:55.450
<v Speaker 2>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4089
03:11:55.490 --> 03:11:57.250
<v Speaker 2>the things that bothers some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't bother.</v>

4090
03:11:58.040 --> 03:11:58.873
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that we got to take </v>

4091
03:12:00.661 --> 03:12:01.770
<v Speaker 5>into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4092
03:12:01.771 --> 03:12:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>universalize for my experience,</v>

4093
03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:05.753
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is what's happened to me and </v>

4094
03:12:06.931 --> 03:12:08.760
<v Speaker 5>this is what's happened to my wife and </v>
<v Speaker 5>my daughter.</v>

4095
03:12:08.761 --> 03:12:09.594
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all of it's been well with mckayla </v>

4096
03:12:11.251 --> 03:12:12.780
<v Speaker 5>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's miraculous.</v>

4097
03:12:12.810 --> 03:12:15.660
<v Speaker 5>I cannot believe that the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw it made me cry.</v>

4098
03:12:15.900 --> 03:12:18.690
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen her look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She looked so good.</v>

4099
03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:19.553
<v Speaker 5>She's so healthy and over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other joints are not experiencing any </v>

4100
03:12:21.961 --> 03:12:22.794
<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's taking no immunomodulators at </v>

4101
03:12:25.141 --> 03:12:26.400
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No medication.</v>

4102
03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:29.190
<v Speaker 5>And she was on them for jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4103
03:12:29.220 --> 03:12:31.830
<v Speaker 5>More medication than you can shake a </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick at methotrexate,</v>

4104
03:12:31.831 --> 03:12:34.440
<v Speaker 5>which is basically a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they use it to treat cancer.</v>

4105
03:12:34.441 --> 03:12:35.720
<v Speaker 5>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>

4106
03:12:35.930 --> 03:12:37.950
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the cancer treating drugs called?</v>

4107
03:12:38.490 --> 03:12:39.323
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember at the moment she was </v>

4108
03:12:40.711 --> 03:12:42.600
<v Speaker 5>on enbrel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which really,</v>

4109
03:12:42.601 --> 03:12:43.580
<v Speaker 5>really helped,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

4110
03:12:43.610 --> 03:12:45.630
<v Speaker 5>but later open to bacterial infection.</v>

4111
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:49.570
<v Speaker 5>so she always had pneumonia in The fall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but enbril really helped.</v>

4112
03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:55.060
<v Speaker 5>And then heaVy doses of antidepressants </v>
<v Speaker 5>and ritalin and jesus was.</v>

4113
03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:57.080
<v Speaker 5>How long has she been on this carnivore </v>
<v Speaker 5>diet?</v>

4114
03:12:58.280 --> 03:12:59.990
<v Speaker 5>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's only been eating meat.</v>

4115
03:12:59.991 --> 03:13:03.530
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be at least six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>months now.</v>

4116
03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And does she get blood work done?</v>

4117
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yep.</v>

4118
03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:10.340
<v Speaker 5>And her blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't comment on that.</v>

4119
03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:12.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the details of her blood </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

4120
03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:15.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know the answer.</v>

4121
03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:18.830
<v Speaker 5>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious,</v>

4122
03:13:18.900 --> 03:13:20.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm considering trying it for awhile.</v>

4123
03:13:20.990 --> 03:13:24.440
<v Speaker 5>The problem is I ate so much game meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of.</v>

4124
03:13:24.570 --> 03:13:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Get some fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the trick there.</v>

4125
03:13:26.511 --> 03:13:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Tried for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what happens.</v>

4126
03:13:27.951 --> 03:13:28.880
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell?</v>

4127
03:13:28.881 --> 03:13:29.714
<v Speaker 5>A month,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4128
03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:32.720
<v Speaker 5>just a month now amongst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not hard.</v>

4129
03:13:33.230 --> 03:13:35.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

4130
03:13:36.390 --> 03:13:38.150
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's wrap this up.</v>

4131
03:13:38.300 --> 03:13:39.320
<v Speaker 5>Already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did three hours.</v>

4132
03:13:39.321 --> 03:13:40.700
<v Speaker 5>It's already 2:20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe it or not.</v>

4133
03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:41.630
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

4134
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:42.703
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always a pleasure and I want to </v>

4135
03:13:44.631 --> 03:13:49.220
<v Speaker 5>bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How weird is this a whole association to</v>

4136
03:13:49.221 --> 03:13:50.630
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's weird to me.</v>

4137
03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:55.840
<v Speaker 5>The idw dew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That of course intellectual dark web.</v>

4138
03:13:56.391 --> 03:13:57.224
<v Speaker 5>The hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like I've been trying to puzzle it </v>

4139
03:13:58.791 --> 03:13:59.624
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think what it is is a loose </v>

4140
03:14:01.221 --> 03:14:04.190
<v Speaker 5>collection of early adopters of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>revolutionary technology.</v>

4141
03:14:04.850 --> 03:14:05.683
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we found each other because we're </v>

4142
03:14:07.491 --> 03:14:10.640
<v Speaker 5>all doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a bunch of people that are</v>

4143
03:14:10.641 --> 03:14:15.641
<v Speaker 5>honest intellectually honest about their</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe don't even don't even agree on</v>

4144
03:14:15.990 --> 03:14:16.350
<v Speaker 5>full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4145
03:14:16.350 --> 03:14:18.440
<v Speaker 5>well definitely but honest about </v>
<v Speaker 5>perception.</v>

4146
03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also I think interested in long form</v>

4147
03:14:20.541 --> 03:14:21.570
<v Speaker 5>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

4148
03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:22.693
<v Speaker 5>and able to engage in it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise we wouldn't be having the </v>

4149
03:14:25.341 --> 03:14:27.050
<v Speaker 5>relative success that we're having in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4150
03:14:27.130 --> 03:14:28.150
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the middle,</v>

4151
03:14:28.250 --> 03:14:29.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it got a name and that's kind of </v>

4152
03:14:30.411 --> 03:14:30.980
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

4153
03:14:30.980 --> 03:14:32.420
<v Speaker 5>And that's eric though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4154
03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:33.380
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's eric.</v>

4155
03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:35.180
<v Speaker 5>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4156
03:14:35.181 --> 03:14:38.760
<v Speaker 5>He certainly does versus spies </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely,</v>

4157
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:41.120
<v Speaker 5>definitely denies it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves it.</v>

4158
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:43.220
<v Speaker 5>Which is what's most interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

4159
03:14:43.221 --> 03:14:44.460
<v Speaker 5>I love to rib him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4160
03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:45.343
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's got this funny conspiratorial </v>

4161
03:14:46.791 --> 03:14:50.210
<v Speaker 5>element there that's sort of true in </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of mostly dramatic.</v>

4162
03:14:50.211 --> 03:14:53.870
<v Speaker 5>And as a mathematician he's always </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking for patterns and codes.</v>

4163
03:14:55.010 --> 03:14:55.843
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean things get a name and then you </v>

4164
03:14:58.101 --> 03:14:58.934
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well why did that get named and well </v>

4165
03:14:59.961 --> 03:15:01.280
<v Speaker 5>someone named it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

4166
03:15:01.281 --> 03:15:02.114
<v Speaker 5>but the name stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it seemed apropos to some degree and </v>

4167
03:15:04.730 --> 03:15:06.080
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do we have in common?</v>

4168
03:15:06.320 --> 03:15:07.153
<v Speaker 5>Most of us are entrepreneurial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of us have our own platform so we </v>

4169
03:15:10.041 --> 03:15:10.874
<v Speaker 5>can speak independently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of us are interested in long form </v>

4170
03:15:14.390 --> 03:15:16.250
<v Speaker 5>philosophical discussions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primarily,</v>

4171
03:15:16.251 --> 03:15:18.530
<v Speaker 5>not political but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but bordering on political,</v>

4172
03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:20.690
<v Speaker 5>well bands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more political office.</v>

4173
03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:21.620
<v Speaker 5>He's the most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4174
03:15:21.621 --> 03:15:24.380
<v Speaker 5>but he's also very sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 5>political commentator,</v>

4175
03:15:24.381 --> 03:15:27.020
<v Speaker 5>so he borders on both the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the religious.</v>

4176
03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then we're,</v>

4177
03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:33.410
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're all the newly new adopters of this</v>

4178
03:15:33.411 --> 03:15:35.810
<v Speaker 5>new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's enough to put us in a group.</v>

4179
03:15:35.811 --> 03:15:36.531
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4180
03:15:36.531 --> 03:15:38.450
<v Speaker 5>it turns out that we've all been talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to each other,</v>

4181
03:15:38.451 --> 03:15:39.284
<v Speaker 5>but part of the reason for that is while</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're all doing the same thing on the </v>

4182
03:15:41.571 --> 03:15:42.404
<v Speaker 5>net,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's not surprising that we're </v>

4183
03:15:43.101 --> 03:15:43.934
<v Speaker 5>talking to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I always go for the simple </v>

4184
03:15:45.441 --> 03:15:47.090
<v Speaker 5>explanations first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4185
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.943
<v Speaker 5>it's not a movement exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the manifestation of a new </v>

4186
03:15:51.181 --> 03:15:52.014
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then while do we have anything in </v>

4187
03:15:53.911 --> 03:15:57.750
<v Speaker 5>common that's worth discussing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would make this a viable group,</v>

4188
03:15:57.751 --> 03:16:00.630
<v Speaker 5>let's say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer to that is out of.</v>

4189
03:16:00.631 --> 03:16:02.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4190
03:16:02.011 --> 03:16:03.120
<v Speaker 5>I've been touring with ruben.</v>

4191
03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:03.953
<v Speaker 5>That's been good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been good to have a comedian along </v>

4192
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:06.383
<v Speaker 5>and he's also a good interviewer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does the q and a's with me and it's </v>

4193
03:16:09.181 --> 03:16:13.200
<v Speaker 5>nice to have some levity in the mix </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the conversations or discussions</v>

4194
03:16:13.201 --> 03:16:16.890
<v Speaker 5>with the audience are very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although I can crack a joke and uh,</v>

4195
03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:21.060
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if something funny occurs to be,</v>

4196
03:16:21.061 --> 03:16:24.240
<v Speaker 5>I can say it and sometimes it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's something,</v>

4197
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:25.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4198
03:16:25.911 --> 03:16:26.744
<v Speaker 5>and we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been discussing a fair bit and I </v>

4199
03:16:28.741 --> 03:16:31.650
<v Speaker 5>had good conversations with shapiro and </v>
<v Speaker 5>harris for that matter.</v>

4200
03:16:31.651 --> 03:16:34.110
<v Speaker 5>So there is lots of interplay between </v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

4201
03:16:34.111 --> 03:16:34.944
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's more because we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we inhabit the same technological space </v>

4202
03:16:38.791 --> 03:16:43.791
<v Speaker 5>more than the same ideological space </v>
<v Speaker 5>apart from the fact that we are actually</v>

4203
03:16:43.981 --> 03:16:48.981
<v Speaker 5>interested in dialogue fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we'll see.</v>

4204
03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:50.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

4205
03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:53.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching it with curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you</v>

4206
03:16:53.390 --> 03:16:56.250
<v Speaker 2>propensive do you think that there's any</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential downside?</v>

4207
03:16:56.300 --> 03:16:58.520
<v Speaker 5>So thEre's lots of downsides to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4208
03:16:58.521 --> 03:16:59.780
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of downsides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4209
03:16:59.781 --> 03:17:01.530
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4210
03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:05.690
<v Speaker 5>most of us are on an individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>individualistic path.</v>

4211
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:07.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really much of a group guy,</v>

4212
03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:10.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so am I in this group?</v>

4213
03:17:10.431 --> 03:17:11.241
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4214
03:17:11.241 --> 03:17:13.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm pleased to be associated with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

4215
03:17:13.641 --> 03:17:14.474
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't really know what it would </v>

4216
03:17:16.521 --> 03:17:17.354
<v Speaker 5>mean or if it should mean anything or if</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll screw up what I'm doing or if </v>

4217
03:17:19.641 --> 03:17:20.970
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about it,</v>

4218
03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:23.390
<v Speaker 5>but mostly I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4219
03:17:23.480 --> 03:17:25.980
<v Speaker 5>huh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a group.</v>

4220
03:17:25.981 --> 03:17:26.814
<v Speaker 5>I thought this is the rat pack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought when I walked into the </v>

4221
03:17:28.471 --> 03:17:29.304
<v Speaker 5>restaurant with us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because we were out last night was ben </v>

4222
03:17:30.751 --> 03:17:33.210
<v Speaker 5>shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sam harris,</v>

4223
03:17:33.330 --> 03:17:34.950
<v Speaker 5>eric weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dave rubin,</v>

4224
03:17:34.951 --> 03:17:37.380
<v Speaker 5>joe rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and me and my wife tammy.</v>

4225
03:17:37.710 --> 03:17:39.930
<v Speaker 5>And so we're all walking in there and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought,</v>

4226
03:17:39.931 --> 03:17:42.270
<v Speaker 5>well this is kinda like being in the rat</v>
<v Speaker 5>pack in the 19 fifties.</v>

4227
03:17:42.270 --> 03:17:42.840
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4228
03:17:42.840 --> 03:17:43.830
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it isn't,</v>

4229
03:17:43.831 --> 03:17:46.460
<v Speaker 5>but that's what came to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I thought that's funny and it's,</v>

4230
03:17:46.461 --> 03:17:47.294
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of cool and it's interesting </v>

4231
03:17:48.691 --> 03:17:52.050
<v Speaker 5>and it's edgy and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not,</v>

4232
03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:54.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

4233
03:17:54.920 --> 03:17:56.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm not also not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4234
03:17:56.101 --> 03:17:58.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not seriously either,</v>

4235
03:17:58.141 --> 03:17:58.974
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching everybody interact because </v>

4236
03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:04.350
<v Speaker 5>it is a very motley crew of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is so,</v>

4237
03:18:04.351 --> 03:18:08.520
<v Speaker 5>and they're very different and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was very enjoyable.</v>

4238
03:18:08.521 --> 03:18:09.510
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4239
03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:11.100
<v Speaker 5>so why did you think it was enjoyable?</v>

4240
03:18:11.530 --> 03:18:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Good conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4241
03:18:13.230 --> 03:18:14.063
<v Speaker 2>everyone that was in that group has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my podcast or I've been on there and </v>

4242
03:18:17.800 --> 03:18:21.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun group of really honest,</v>

4243
03:18:21.660 --> 03:18:25.040
<v Speaker 2>interesting people that truly are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar people.</v>

4244
03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Especially eric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's listening right now.</v>

4245
03:18:27.781 --> 03:18:29.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm fucking with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy,</v>

4246
03:18:30.210 --> 03:18:32.060
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all,</v>

4247
03:18:32.130 --> 03:18:32.963
<v Speaker 2>everyone's different but everyone's also</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique and they all bring a lot to the </v>

4248
03:18:35.641 --> 03:18:37.170
<v Speaker 2>table and that's what's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

4249
03:18:37.600 --> 03:18:40.700
<v Speaker 2>The weird collection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4250
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:41.543
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when eric called me up about the </v>

4251
03:18:43.981 --> 03:18:45.180
<v Speaker 2>whole New York times thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4254
03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:50.650
<v Speaker 3>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

4255
03:18:50.650 --> 03:18:52.690
<v Speaker 3>What did you be part of the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>times article?</v>

4256
03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:53.583
<v Speaker 3>A barely was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just answered a couple of questions </v>

4257
03:18:56.170 --> 03:18:58.300
<v Speaker 3>because you got a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4258
03:18:58.301 --> 03:19:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I picture of you right.</v>

4259
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:02.620
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should have taken a picture of me.</v>

4260
03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:04.900
<v Speaker 3>I was dressed like I was going on stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store.</v>

4261
03:19:04.901 --> 03:19:05.734
<v Speaker 3>I didn't wear anything any differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to make a big deal of </v>

4262
03:19:07.571 --> 03:19:07.811
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4263
03:19:07.811 --> 03:19:08.830
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any time.</v>

4264
03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:10.910
<v Speaker 3>You want to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm wearing.</v>

4265
03:19:10.911 --> 03:19:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4266
03:19:11.460 --> 03:19:12.293
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did it on the parking lot above the </v>

4267
03:19:14.351 --> 03:19:16.480
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and it started to rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

4268
03:19:16.481 --> 03:19:17.740
<v Speaker 3>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go,</v>

4269
03:19:18.010 --> 03:19:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I gotta go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be soaking wet,</v>

4270
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:22.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go on stage and that was it,</v>

4271
03:19:22.490 --> 03:19:23.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just.</v>

4272
03:19:23.740 --> 03:19:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your take on it is that it's.</v>

4273
03:19:25.630 --> 03:19:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's intro your take on it.</v>

4274
03:19:26.921 --> 03:19:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Is that it's interest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4275
03:19:28.210 --> 03:19:29.043
<v Speaker 3>Well this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is probably another thing that </v>

4276
03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:31.773
<v Speaker 3>unites that group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in that group of people is </v>

4277
03:19:35.471 --> 03:19:38.380
<v Speaker 3>likely to get in trouble because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>find too many things.</v>

4278
03:19:38.381 --> 03:19:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trait,</v>

4279
03:19:40.360 --> 03:19:41.193
<v Speaker 3>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that unites all of </v>

4280
03:19:42.491 --> 03:19:47.491
<v Speaker 3>us and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity killed the cat and so did,</v>

4281
03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:51.010
<v Speaker 3>but we're not cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True curiosity also built the pyramids.</v>

4282
03:19:51.070 --> 03:19:51.903
<v Speaker 3>It did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did,</v>

4283
03:19:51.910 --> 03:19:53.690
<v Speaker 3>it did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it saved a lot of caps too.</v>

4284
03:19:56.400 --> 03:19:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's end with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
