00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.460
The joe rogan experience

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.920
podcast all day.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.830
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.780
<v 1>Mr. Russell.
Hey,
thank you very much for doing this,
man.
I appreciate it.</v>

5
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.110
Thank you.
It's a,
we were saying right before the podcast got started.

6
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.350
It's always a weird thing when,
when people sit down,

7
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.240
it's like you don't want to talk too much because there's so much to say on the

8
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.790
air.
You don't want to get it out before they get to air.

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.260
But I was saying that it's very,

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.350
it's appropriate having you on today because we're just now going to war with

11
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.900
Syria.
Right.
And uh,
we were,
uh,

12
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.400
we were just talking about how bizarre this isis thing is and how it's just

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.830
American people said,
you know,
we don't want to go to war with Syria.

14
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.550
It was this big thing and Obama was on television.

15
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:58.850
Everybody just openly rejected it.
Left and right.

16
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:01.700
It was pretty much the American public was like,
we're done with war.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.180
Like we want to get out of Afghanistan.
We don't want this Iraq thing anymore.

18
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.830
We don't want to go to Syria.

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.910
And so everything just sort of calmed down and then all of a sudden the isis

20
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:12.920
rose up from the,
from the ashes.

21
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.350
And this isis thing I did with different names.
Isis,
I,
I've seen it.

22
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:23.000
Isi L,
right?
Yeah.
And um,
I was saying,

23
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.540
I don't like to get conspiracy oriented because it's so easy to do.

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.610
But if you wanted to,
you would say,
well,

25
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:32.870
this is obviously they've come up with a mechanism to get us into Syria.
Sure.

26
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:34.520
I mean,
so there's two kinds of conspiracies.

27
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:37.760
There's an open conspiracy and then there's a closed conspiracy.
Right?

28
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.530
So I think this is sort of an open conspiracy.

29
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.440
A lot of people are saying both left and right by the way,

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.980
that isis was really a creation of American foreign policy.

31
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.000
Not that there were a bunch of dudes sitting in a room in the White House with

32
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.080
cigars and saying,
hey,

33
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:55.340
we need to create this monster in order to sort of impose American,
we'll abroad.

34
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.050
But that through many,

35
00:01:57.051 --> 00:02:00.200
many conscious decisions over many years in the Middle East through direct

36
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:02.270
interventions,
militarily and otherwise,

37
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.470
they created the conditions for this bunch of psychopathic 20 year olds with

38
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:10.130
RPGs and swords beheading people,
right?
So,
you know,

39
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:13.130
creating a vacuum in Iraq,
right?
By going to war there,

40
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:17.240
by removing the dictator who was at least holding control over the people and

41
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.830
where people like this,
a funding the rebels in Syria.

42
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.440
And also more importantly,
a lot of people miss this.
You know,

43
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.950
what's one of the things that's been happening if you look at it just from a

44
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
material standpoint over the last 12 years at least,

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.950
is that the United States has been flooding that area with weapons,
right?
So,

46
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:38.510
and if you look at it,
there's a great piece,

47
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.280
I think it was in the Guardian a few weeks ago.
Uh,

48
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:44.810
the Isis is using American made weapons,
right?

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.390
That have been coming into that region,
mostly into Iraq,

50
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.980
but elsewhere for just decades.
Right?
So it's just,
it creates this,

51
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.540
it creates a situation where,
uh,
sort of a self fulfilling prophecy,

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.610
sort of an Obgyn,
open conspiracy,

53
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:03.100
because you certainly say that American foreign policy makers and all of them

54
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.610
really.

55
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.210
And that's Bush and that's Obama and that's all of them really want to have an

56
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.860
American presence,
a military strong military presence around the world.

57
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.400
And in particular in the Middle East where all the oil is.
So,
you know,

58
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.100
it's not it,
I'm not saying it was deliberate that they,

59
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.280
it wasn't a deliberate choice to create this beast that's called Isis,

60
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.780
but it's certainly serves their purposes.

61
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.050
And it seems like if you,

62
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.400
I mean if you look at the entire situation in the Middle East,

63
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460
it seems like there's no good way to just get out of there.

64
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.700
It seems like,
is there,
I mean,
please tell me,

65
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.220
I mean there's a way to,
yeah,
I mean,
so I'm an out now guy.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean,

66
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.820
I think that was the answer in Vietnam,
right?
That's what they,

67
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.180
that's what the Anti Vietnam war called for for many,
many years was out.
Now,
not,

68
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.090
not a gradual withdrawal,
which is what the politicians called for backup,

69
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.000
because that's the quote responsible thing to do,
but out now,

70
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.330
and I think history proves that was the correct answer to that,
right?

71
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:09.160
I think that if the United States had left immediately in 1964 65 name a year

72
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.130
name a time,
it would have been a better thing for everyone.
Now,

73
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.700
communism would have,
the communist would have taken control of Vietnam,

74
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.870
but they did anyway,
right?

75
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.850
And so what we had was instead of about 2 million people,
mostly civilians die,

76
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.740
right?
We would have had far fewer,

77
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:27.760
we would have had the same outcome essentially with far fewer.
And then also,

78
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:31.810
and we've got to talk about blowback,
right?
So,
you know,
the,

79
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.280
the carpet bombing of not just Vietnam,

80
00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:39.281
but several countries during that war caused untold numbers of people to hate

81
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.900
our fucking guts,
right?
America's guts and that,
you know,
uh,

82
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.550
that's blowback,
right?
They didn't come and fly airplanes into our buildings,

83
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.000
but you know,
it was anti American in many ways.
And it also served.

84
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.870
And here's very important thing.

85
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.840
It's served the interests of the cod damn communists,
right?

86
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.850
Because it's because the communist could say,

87
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.660
look at these barbarians coming here and killing our children and women,
right?

88
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.940
You should support us.
We will protect you from them.

89
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.160
So it actually played into the hands of the Communist.

90
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:09.100
And the very same thing is happening and it has been happening in the Middle

91
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.090
East for many,
many years.

92
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.500
David Petraeus of all people said before the Senate about three years ago,

93
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:15.280
he said,

94
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.640
US funding of Israel in particular us funding of all these corrupt regimes in

95
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.920
the,
in the Middle East,

96
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.390
and our interventions is the number one recruiting tool for al Qaeda,
right?

97
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.180
And it's the number one recruiting tool for isis.
They say,
look,

98
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.180
here's these infidels who have been invading us and killing our people and

99
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:35.050
taking control of our resources for decades,
right?
We will,

100
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.700
we will fight back for you.
Right?
And so it,
it's,
it's,
it's uh,

101
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.720
it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy if you want to maintain a presence there,

102
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.580
which they do.
The United States does.

103
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.730
You keep creating your own enemies to fight against.
It's perpetual.

104
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.350
So what could beat,

105
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:55.351
is there anything that can be done to mitigate the disastrous effects of us

106
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:58.130
pulling out and creating this power vacuum?

107
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 2>Is there anything that can be done?
I mean,
once we're already there,</v>

108
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.500
we can't go back in time.
We can't stop the Iraq invasion.

109
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.400
It would be nice if we could pretty much,
no one thinks it's a good idea now,

110
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.250
today in hindsight,
everyone thinks it was a terrible idea.

111
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.760
The only good that came out of it was getting Saddam Hussein out,

112
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.340
getting rid of his psychopathic sons.

113
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.020
But now look at all the shit you have there and you have a million people dead,

114
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.390
<v 1>right?
So the anti intervention,</v>

115
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.510
it's argument is simply that pretty much every interview intervention has a

116
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:28.510
negative consequence.
So the less the better.
Right?

117
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:30.160
So my position is that do none,
right?

118
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.850
<v 2>But when you have a guy like a Hitler or someone along those lines that's</v>

119
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.360
causing genocide and planning to take over the world.
And

120
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.250
<v 1>so,
but,
uh,
so,
so for Hitler,
right,</v>

121
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.430
there's a large stream of thought among historians,

122
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.030
very respectable stream of thought that the Nazis rose to power out of

123
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:54.810
conditions created by the allies after World War One.
So that,

124
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:55.200
you know,

125
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.190
extracting all these resources through forced payments from the Germans as

126
00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:00.960
reparations after World War One,

127
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.210
a really laid the groundwork for the rise of this,
this totalitarian who said,

128
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:10.020
hey,
look what those westerners did to us.
They decimated this country.

129
00:07:10.021 --> 00:07:13.500
They shamed us,
they brought us into shame and degradation.
We need a strong,

130
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:15.990
powerful leader.
We need discipline.
We need order.

131
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.610
We need to get rid of these foreign influences like Jews who were considered to

132
00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:24.650
be foreign,
right?
In essence,
because they were a nation,
unless people,
uh,

133
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.380
and the communists who had allegiance to know state,
right?
Um,

134
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.970
and so many people have argued,
not just wacko conspiracy theorists that,

135
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.560
that it was actually American and western foreign policy in the early 20th

136
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.350
century that really made the rise of Nazi is impossible.

137
00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:41.161
Like that's the greatest,

138
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:44.160
possibly the greatest example of blowback in human history.

139
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.800
<v 2>That's a crazy example of blowback.
It's,</v>

140
00:07:46.801 --> 00:07:49.580
it seems like it's a perpetual cycle then it seems like everything we've ever

141
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.410
done in the past has led us to do more things in the future to combat the blow

142
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.190
back from the things we've done in the past.

143
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.250
<v 1>Yeah.
So I mean,
if you look at it,</v>

144
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.140
but if you look at the history of foreign policy,
and by the way,

145
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:01.510
that's the book I'm working on now.
Uh,

146
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.570
so this is a very appropriate topic for me.
Um,
you know,

147
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.140
you will see beginning really even in the early 90 [inaudible] in the early 18th

148
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.840
century,
uh,
with,
uh,
or not,
sorry,
late 18th century,

149
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:14.710
but some of the founding fathers,

150
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.890
but certainly through the 19th century and certainly through the 20th century,

151
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.160
one continuous thread among policy makers,

152
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:25.150
which is we must change the world in our image,
right?
I mean,

153
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.140
that's been bipartisan.
It's been the left.
It's been the right,
it's been,
I mean,

154
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.490
the Liberals and the conservatives,

155
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:33.550
it's been the Democrats and the Republicans for centuries now.

156
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.940
We must have America abroad now.
Not everyone agreed with that.

157
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.740
There were people in the Senate who were sort of isolationists or anti

158
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:42.070
interventionists,
but that's been a pretty,

159
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:46.120
there's been a near consensus among American politicians for about two centuries

160
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:49.480
that we should expand what is great about America.

161
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.610
And unfortunately that has meant killing a lot of people.

162
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.950
<v 2>That's what everyone's terrified of with the Islamic state,
is that</v>

163
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 1>they want to impose sharia law throughout the rest of the world.
I mean,</v>

164
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:04.060
that's what everyone's afraid of the,
the,
the religion of America.
They,
uh,

165
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.550
you know,
what we subscribe to versus the religion of Sharia law.

166
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.140
So I have an answer for that.
Okay.
Yeah.

167
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:17.940
So good luck motherfuckers imposing sharia law on the whole world.
Right.

168
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.070
And so what my,
a lot of what my work is on now,

169
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:24.330
and I'm not the only one who's done this,
is to look at what's actually going on.

170
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.811
You know,

171
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:29.550
in places like Ron and in places like Riyadh and in places like Cairo,

172
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.940
um,
what are the,
what are sort of ordinary folks,

173
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.830
Iranians and Egyptians and Saudis actually doing all day long.

174
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.760
And you can figure it out really quickly by simply looking at the skyline in

175
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:45.090
those cities.
And what you'll see is you'll see these big apartment buildings.

176
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.910
He's big cinder block apartment buildings.
And on top of those,

177
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:51.330
center on top of those apartment buildings are dozens,

178
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.360
sometimes hundreds of satellite dishes,

179
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.450
which are streaming in Fox,

180
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.300
the Simpsons porn like you wouldn't believe during the porn.

181
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.330
They love porn in Middle East and Pakistan,
Google did,

182
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:07.770
Google has announced for several years,

183
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:12.480
Pakistan is the leading country in the world for searches for the word sex.
Whoa.

184
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.950
And then in particular,
uh,
also interesting,
uh,
uh,

185
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.600
searches for gay sex,
like terms like gay sex terms like anal sex and men,

186
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.350
men,
men on men or whatever.
The Middle East is like leading the world in that,

187
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.040
right?
And they,

188
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.930
what they love is they love American nasty pop culture and Western nasty pop

189
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:31.650
culture.
They love,

190
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.570
they love women in Bikinis and they love whiskey and they love stupid,
you know,

191
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.290
they love Jersey shore and the rest of it stuff that we looked down on and

192
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.120
actually what it's doing,
my argument is,

193
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.050
is that it's subverting the hell at a Sharia law every single day.

194
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.520
We say we look down on it,

195
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.730
but we obviously created support it and probably consume more of it than it.

196
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.730
When I say,
when I say we,
I mean up to you and no,
I know.
I know.

197
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.100
I mean uptight professors like the ones I deal with,
not like normal people.

198
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.440
You've been fired from being like a little too controversial.

199
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.030
Yeah.
I read an article about you Huffington posts that you wrote.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

200
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.040
yeah.
What,
what,
what was that all about?
Well,
I mean,
um,
so I,
uh,
you know,

201
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:17.040
I was trained at Columbia University and got my phd there in American history

202
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:21.960
and uh,
sort of found that like,
um,
historians in general,

203
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:25.020
but in particular the historians I was being trained by,
you know,

204
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:27.890
they consider themselves to be left wing and radical.
But then there,

205
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.370
there's a real limitation on that.

206
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.600
And one of the limitations was that they had a real disdain for what normal

207
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.610
people do all day long,
like what they're doing in Riyadh in Tiran.
Uh,

208
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.170
they had a real disdain for sorted the,

209
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:41.970
the normal activities of working class ordinary folks.

210
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:45.630
Like they thought that what people watched on TV was retarded and should not be

211
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:49.290
studied and shouldn't,
they shouldn't be doing it.
Um,
that it wasn't,

212
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.970
that's not real history.
That's not what's really going on.

213
00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:55.210
What you should be studying the Senate and you should be studying sort of

214
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:59.620
economics.
And she was gonna be studying foreign policy.
And what I found was,

215
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:00.640
you know,
first of all,
that's what,

216
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.580
of course most Americans do as they consume that kind of stuff,

217
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:07.600
much more than they do political speeches.
Right?
And more importantly,

218
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.100
kind of in that popular culture and in particular the stuff that we most look

219
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:12.934
down on,

220
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.150
what you'll find is stuff like sex and freedom and drugs and drinking and

221
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.971
freedom and people doing what they want to do sort of opposed to an against kind

222
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:27.520
of our puritan tradition,
right?

223
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.450
So that America has always been split between its puritanism,

224
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.380
which is really powerful still up in particular in our formal culture like in

225
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:39.400
politics and what they tell us in schools,
right?
And and,

226
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.160
and hedonism,
which is what we get in popular culture,
right?

227
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.550
So it's as we were this very weird schizophrenia culture,
right?

228
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.200
There's this conflict between the two.

229
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.400
And what I found was that people who call themselves left wing and radical are

230
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:55.090
actually really wedded to the puritanical side that they,

231
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:59.110
they're really about people being disciplined and controlled and working hard

232
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.800
and the work ethic and all that stuff.
And I know you,
you've talked about,

233
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.050
I've heard you talk about the work ethic on here and elsewhere,

234
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.870
but we can get into what that actually means because there's also confusion

235
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.920
about what that means.
But I was sort of frustrated.
I was like,
first of all,
Yo,

236
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.690
I'm walking the streets in New York City when we went to Columbia and I,

237
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.740
nobody looks like these people in my history books,

238
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.220
including Rosa Parks who's on your wall here and Martin Luther King who a lot,

239
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:23.170
and we can talk about this.
This is a big part of my book.
A lot.

240
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:26.350
Those people were extremely conservative,
culturally,

241
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.620
extremely conservative culturally and looked down upon and scolded black people

242
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.640
for black culture,
for things like jazz and rock and roll.

243
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:40.120
Martin Luther King was opposed to rock and roll called it the devil's music.

244
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.960
People don't know this.
Yeah.
So,
um,
so I started looking at that.

245
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.780
I started looking at these new heroes and the new social history,
you know,

246
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:49.430
these left wing activists and people like Rosa Parks,

247
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.500
Martin Luther King and feminists suffragists and all that.

248
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.540
And I found it like they actually agreed with the puritans about things like sex

249
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:02.290
and work,
that sex is terrible and work is awesome and virtuous.

250
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.820
So I got very frustrated.

251
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:07.030
I started writing my lectures and my classes at Barnard College,

252
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:09.130
which is the women's college affiliated with Columbia.

253
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.830
I started looking at American history.
Through that Lens.

254
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.920
I started looking at American history through the lens of this conflict,

255
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.900
this eternal conflict between discipline and order and community and nation on

256
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.570
one hand and puritanism and on the other hand,

257
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:25.330
popular culture and sex and freedom and desire.

258
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.120
And I found this whole new way of telling the story.

259
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.220
And I found all these people on one side sorta just behaving on their own,

260
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:34.690
doing the things they wanted to do,

261
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.400
that we're violating these puritanical principles.
People like prostitutes,

262
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:42.910
people like drunks,
people like criminals,
people like gays,

263
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:45.820
people like slaves who were dancing when you weren't supposed to dance.

264
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.231
And on the other hand,

265
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:51.370
all these guardians of the moral order who weren't just the founding fathers,

266
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.110
uh,
and the generals and the inventors,

267
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:57.650
but it was people like abolitionists who were opposed to slavery,

268
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:01.850
but they were opposed to slavery for funky reasons.
We can talk about,
uh,
uh,

269
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:02.900
and suffragists.

270
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.470
He wanted women to be really just as upstanding as men and to not drink and not

271
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:11.220
have sex,
et cetera.
Um,
and so I gave lectures.
I was given the,
uh,

272
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.400
introduction to American history course at Columbia.

273
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.890
They did because they didn't know what I was up to.

274
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.540
And because it's a weird thing,
it's one of the strangest industries.

275
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.210
There's no oversight over what you're doing and your classrooms,

276
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:25.550
no one ever comes and watches what you say.

277
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.520
It's a very strange thing in higher education professors,

278
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:31.940
99% of the time just go into the classroom and their colleagues have no idea

279
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.550
what they're saying.
Does that become an issue with ego?
Because a,

280
00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:40.010
I find that anytime when you get one person that gets to communicate to a large

281
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:41.390
group of people and they have to listen to you,

282
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:46.220
especially if parts of their future rely upon you.
Like they're your grades,

283
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.340
your,
your GPA,
it's important to pass this class.

284
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.390
And so this person has this position of power and influence.

285
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.950
It's very unusual.
Sure.
Because of that.
A lot of times people,
they,

286
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.680
that they get into that position of being a professor,

287
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:05.570
they push their ideology in a very rigid and inflexible way.
I'm right,

288
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:10.040
you are wrong.
I am older.
You are younger.
I am smart.
You are dumb.
Absolutely.

289
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.230
And it's the time gross apps.
I agree.

290
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.880
So what I have to say about that is that we all,

291
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.350
we all come at questions through our own ideologies,
right?
No one,

292
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.770
there's nothing.

293
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.010
I don't think there's any such thing as an objective history or an objective

294
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:25.970
political science.
I mean,

295
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:30.160
I think we all talk about these things through our own biases and our own
lenses,

296
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.760
right?
First of all,

297
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.340
I think what we should do is just admit it and be honest about it.

298
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.740
And that's what I tried to do in my classes.
I try to say,
Hey,

299
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.340
you know what I just told you?
That's my interpretation.
That's not the truth.

300
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.510
I never tell the truth.
I only tell people what I think.
Right.

301
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.110
And with an argument.
Right,
right.
Um,
and the second thing is,

302
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:51.080
and this is what the,
this is the real problem.
I think in higher education,

303
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:54.800
which makes me,
it makes me crazy every single day,
is that right now,

304
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.300
higher ed in particular in the social sciences and humanities is on locked down

305
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.170
by the academic left.
Okay.
And I come out of the left and I'm left wing.

306
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:04.820
And a lot of ways,
and in some ways I'm not,

307
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:09.821
but what I hate is that there's just almost no variety of discourse on college

308
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:14.600
campuses that pretty much it.
And if there's been studies done,

309
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:18.980
I mean like 95% of English and history professors voted for Obama.
Right?

310
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.740
I mean that tells you right there that there's not a whole lot of debate going

311
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.810
on.
Why do you think that is?
Why?

312
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:28.811
Why is academia and the left sort of inexorably connected?

313
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:32.390
Yeah.
Well,
so when a lot of left academics are asked this,

314
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:37.170
the answer that they give you is we're smarter,
right?
Right.

315
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.590
So that we,
it's just in tiff,
you're intelligent and study,

316
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.640
you will come to that position.

317
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:45.620
Now I said it because the right is kinda inexorably connected to religion

318
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.940
because Christianity and the right are pretty much inseparable.
Well,

319
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.550
even even libertarians

320
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.540
<v 3>who are atheists get run out of the house,
you can't get a job as a libertarian.</v>

321
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.950
Wow.
Um,
no,
I mean,
so it's,
it's all historical,
right?

322
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:00.960
So if you look at the history of higher education,

323
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.150
and a lot of people forget this,
you know,
uh,

324
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.160
higher education in this country is only about two centuries old.
And as a,

325
00:18:06.161 --> 00:18:10.800
as a major mass institution,
I mean,
uh,
the right,

326
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.640
right wing conservatives controlled the joint until the 1960s.
Right?

327
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:19.641
So what was being taught at Harvard and Yale and Princeton and cal and UCLA was

328
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.930
things like capitalism is awesome and black people are inferior and women should

329
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:29.730
be in the home.
I mean,
it was,
conservatives had that whole place on lockdown.
Uh,

330
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:31.590
there was a monoculture on,
on the campuses.

331
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.980
Then we'll comes along is the 1960s and all those movements,

332
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:37.800
all those social movements of the antiwar movement,
the civil rights movement,

333
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.220
feminist movement,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And what happened was those people,

334
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:44.670
because their movements either sort of succeeded and they considered,

335
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.750
were considered to be done or they couldn't succeed,

336
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.990
they couldn't really create a radical revolution,
the kind that they wanted,

337
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.910
the only place they found that they could go and have a job was colleges as

338
00:18:56.911 --> 00:19:00.570
professors.
So they on Mohs though that generation,

339
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:04.800
the new left of the 1960s went into graduate school and they all became

340
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:05.341
professors.

341
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:09.240
And that's who's been basically teaching college for the last 50 years.

342
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.380
Um,
so I'm,
I'm of the generation that was trained by them.
And so there,

343
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.510
there's some changes going on,
but basically most,
even most people my age,

344
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:20.370
I'm in my forties but in my generation,

345
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.460
most of us are still sort of influenced by that generation.

346
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:26.550
So it was this very concerted,
not a conspiracy,

347
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:30.630
but it was a pretty deliberate attempt in some ways it was conscious to take

348
00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:31.940
over the university that that was the,

349
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.670
that was the only place we could have this radical discourse and get paid for it

350
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:39.060
and have a career.
Right.
And influenced the,
and influenced the U,

351
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:42.690
which is one of the things that drives a lot of parents crazy.

352
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.400
The parents that have different ideologies and the kid off to school and the kid

353
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:51.630
comes back with like some really sure,
you know,
white privilege,

354
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.040
male privilege.
I'm a victim,
lefty talk.
I'm a victim.

355
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.360
Stuff is strong and it's very disempowering.
Oh yeah.

356
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.300
It's confusing too because I don't know if you know this case.
Um,
there's uh,

357
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.430
from Occidental College,
Boston and all universities.
That's where I teach man.

358
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.530
Is that what you did?
Yeah.
Occidental College.
Oh,
down the road.
Jesus Christ.
Okay.

359
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.950
Do you know the story about the,
uh,
the two young kids,
uh,
they were freshmen.

360
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.910
There was onto the hazing thing.
They both get drunk.
Yes.

361
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.970
And they have sex and the guy gets expelled.
Yes.

362
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:27.270
They're both sexual assault.
They're both drunk.
Not only they both drunk,

363
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:31.110
but the girl texts her friend,
I'm about to go have sex.
Text him.

364
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:35.370
Do you have a condom?
He says,
yes.
He says,
get over there.
She says,
I'm on my way.

365
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.900
She goes over there and they decide that it's sexual assault because the girl

366
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:43.140
had been drinking,
even though the guy had also been drinking.

367
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.740
It's sexual assault.
The guy gets kicked out of college.
He's in the middle of a,

368
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.010
I mean in,

369
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.440
<v 1>when you're 18 years old,
your life is Sarone into a turmoil.
I mean,</v>

370
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.380
he's kicked out of school for having sex while drunk with a girl who was sex

371
00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:01.030
while drunk.
So you're about to get me fired again again.
Yeah.
Thanks for this.

372
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:05.250
Thanks man.
Please pick out.
Yeah,
no,
I gotcha.
So this,

373
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.310
this sexual assault either depending on your point of view,

374
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.350
epidemic or hysteria,

375
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.010
the epicenter of it has been occidental or I've taught,
uh,

376
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.510
it started about two years ago.
This is a long conversation to have.
Please.

377
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.930
I think it's an important one because it's confusing as hell.
Okay.
Okay.

378
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.700
So what happened was in 2010 or 2011,

379
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.200
the United States Department of Education sent a letter to every university and

380
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.000
college in the country that receives federal aid of some kind,

381
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:36.490
which is basically all of them,
right?
Because of student loans.

382
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.550
Those are backed by the federal government and said,
if you,

383
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.120
if you want to continue receiving federal aid for your students,

384
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.440
you must adjudicate every case,

385
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.240
every accusation,

386
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.770
every accusation of sexual assault on your campus among students.
Okay.

387
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.220
Which means you have to have like basically a tribunal,
uh,

388
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.900
of staff and maybe students,
but usually it's staff and faculty,

389
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.610
right?
So it's a panel of like three or four English professors and the dean of

390
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:09.540
students and the facilities guy or whoever,

391
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.810
maybe some students asking,
you know,
uh,
adjudicating this case.

392
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.720
So the woman says,
uh,
well,

393
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:19.030
we were both drunk and whatever,

394
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.570
she tells her story and he tells his story and says,

395
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.980
I absolutely did not rape him.

396
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.790
She says he absolutely did rape me because there's no witnesses almost ever in

397
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:29.440
these cases.
Right?
What,

398
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.890
what can they then do to decide who's responsible here?

399
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.590
Or is there someone who's responsible?
And what they do is,

400
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.360
and I've talked to people who have been on these boards,

401
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.930
the only thing you can do is ask about their sexual histories.

402
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.813
So you have,

403
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.080
you have English professors asking 19 year olds how many times they've had sex

404
00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:51.880
in the last year,
what kinds of sex with whom,
how did they feel about it?

405
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.360
And then asking the guy the same things,
right?
And then from that information,

406
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.420
and usually it's only that because that's all you got in most cases,
right?

407
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:02.220
With acquaintance rape,
it's two people in a,
in a room,
a dark room,

408
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:04.480
and then with the door closed,
almost always there's no evidence,
right?

409
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:05.470
There's no physical evidence,

410
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.400
no witnesses usually from that they determine responsibility.
Um,

411
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.550
so that's basically what happened in this case.
Uh,
it's,

412
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.390
and the other thing that's,
so that's a nightmare and a lot of ways,
right?
I mean,

413
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.880
talk about seeking justice,
right?

414
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.060
It's very bizarre also that this idea has come out of what a lot of people

415
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.410
believe to be what you would call feminism and what feminism is supposed to push

416
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:30.370
for as equality,

417
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.900
but not equality when it comes to responsibility for your sexual actions while

418
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:36.060
you're intoxicated.
Right.

419
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.940
So one of the things that's been infuriating for a lot of people and a lot of

420
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:42.760
feminists by the way,
is that,
you know,

421
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.420
in response to an uh,

422
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.670
acquaintance rape definitely fucking happens.
You know,
no question about it.

423
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.850
We know people,
I know people very closely what's happening

424
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.590
<v 2>through the alley that we should also say that getting someone drunk and fucking</v>

425
00:23:56.591 --> 00:24:00.070
them cause you know,
they're drunk is gross.
It is rape.
Sure.

426
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.270
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
uh,</v>

427
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.360
or at least getting them loaded to the point where they can't figure out what

428
00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:06.500
the fuck is going on.
Right.
So one of the,

429
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.700
one of one answer that's been proffered by many people,

430
00:24:09.701 --> 00:24:13.090
many feminists including has been to say,
Hey,

431
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.520
don't get blackout drunk at the Frat House on Friday night to women.
Right.

432
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.790
And that has been called victim blaming.
Right.
Okay.
So you know about this,
right?

433
00:24:21.791 --> 00:24:26.060
So right now,
if you were to leave it at that,
right?

434
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.170
Say That is the sole answer to this problem.
You know,

435
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.080
tell women not to get drunk at a frat house on Friday night.

436
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.230
Maybe that is victim blaming,
but that's not what any of us are saying.

437
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.430
<v 2>Right.
Well that's like saying,</v>

438
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:40.930
don't the Rutgers kid that got killed by a bear two days ago don't run from
bear.

439
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.940
Exactly.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Does that victim blaming it's fucking wise advice.

440
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.880
If you want to survive a bear attack,
don't run.
They chase.

441
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.860
<v 1>Yeah.
Uh,
I don't have a daughter,
but I have a son,
but you know,</v>

442
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:53.630
if I had a daughter,
goddamn right,

443
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:56.480
I'm going to tell her not to get blackout drunk at the Frat House.
Yeah.
You know,

444
00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.540
you're going to try to stop me and tell me that's,
that's blaming my daughter.
Um,

445
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.260
<v 2>I don't think guys should get blackout drunk at the Frat House.
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

446
00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:08.850
It's not good for you.
People fall off of roofs at frat houses and die from it.

447
00:25:08.851 --> 00:25:13.770
Yeah.
There are people that will take advantage of you and not just sexually.

448
00:25:13.771 --> 00:25:14.550
They'll sure.

449
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.490
There's vicious people that will do things to you if they think you're passed

450
00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:19.440
out.
Absolutely.
It's just not smart.

451
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.610
<v 1>Yeah.
So feminism,
um,
this particular brand of it,</v>

452
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.330
um,
one of the things that's not talked about much,

453
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:31.740
and I tried to talk about this,
is that it,
uh,

454
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.370
it takes agency away from women,
right?
So it's like,
it's,

455
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.470
it's basically saying that women are helpless before these rapists.
You know,

456
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.071
and what we,

457
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:45.690
all we can do is more allies against the rapists and tell them they're bad.

458
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.710
Now many of those feminists have agreed that it's a very,

459
00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:54.090
very tiny percentage of men who are rapists and that most rapes are committed by

460
00:25:54.091 --> 00:25:58.140
something like 4% of men or something like that,
or less than 4%.
Um,

461
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.290
so getting into,
you're gonna tell those guys the serial rapists,

462
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.990
most of them are serial rapists,
that they're bad and they shouldn't rape

463
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.330
<v 2>the fact that it's not going to be less,
even if it's one person,</v>

464
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.830
they could have a hundred guys.
No,
no,
no.

465
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:14.000
<v 1>Sorry.
It's,
it's of,
of the rapes committed for,
uh,
what is it?</v>

466
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.020
It's 4%,
4% of the rape.
I don't know.
It's something like that

467
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.740
<v 2>really hard.
It's a very tiny percentage.</v>

468
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:21.520
It's really hard to do statistics with rape too,

469
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:25.480
because a lot of people don't report rape and they're embarrassed and ashamed.

470
00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:25.720
And

471
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.910
<v 1>we do have,
well,
we do have,
uh,</v>

472
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.230
the bureau of Justice Department of Justice has conducted a pretty massive

473
00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:36.190
surveys of women.
So this is not reported crimes.
This is just,

474
00:26:36.191 --> 00:26:40.540
they went in and ask women questions about their history with assault.

475
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.040
And there's been this massive decline and rapes and sexual

476
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.090
<v 3>assaults since the 1990s,
like more than 60% decline.</v>

477
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.600
So also the talk of a rape epidemic,
um,

478
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.780
and a rape culture now I think is overblown.
I mean,

479
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.980
of course there are elements in our culture that are definitely rape cultures,

480
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:01.890
right?
I mean,
there's no doubt,
you know,
there's a little corners here and there,

481
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.540
but the dominant culture is not a rape culture.
Right.

482
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.720
My issue is that the people that are crying out for this,
especially the men,

483
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.660
they,
there's so,
it's so suspect,

484
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:16.470
it's so white nightie but the whole thing about it,

485
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:21.471
it's these really emo feminist men who just look like they're just clamoring for

486
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:26.490
female acceptance and love and appreciation.

487
00:27:26.491 --> 00:27:29.400
And they're just going way out of their way to talk about this.

488
00:27:29.401 --> 00:27:31.800
And I can understand if this is a personal issue,

489
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:35.940
I can understand that anybody would be concerned that a human being would take

490
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:39.390
advantage of another human being.
But to make it your primary concern,

491
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.500
to make it like this,
I was thinking you focus in constant concentrate on,

492
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.890
on a regular basis all the time.
It's like a almost like a rape fetish,

493
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.450
rape or victimization fetish.
And this,
this apologizing.

494
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.220
Do you remember that video that came out?
A dear women?

495
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.180
It was one of the most horrific videos ever.
It was widely mocked,

496
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.520
but it was these like really fucked up socially retarded men who have made this

497
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:10.230
video where they were apologizing for all the things that women had to endure

498
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:14.600
for men.
But these guys were just creepy.
Fucking weird.
I was like undone.

499
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.910
You've never seen this.
I've got to play it for okay.
Cause it's beautiful.

500
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.560
It's beautiful and it's ridiculous.
So yeah.
So,
but here's the thing about that,

501
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.870
you know,
it's like the,
the mess.

502
00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:29.190
The other message in that is that it's for men to save women,
right?

503
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.560
Exactly.
Excuse me,
feminists.

504
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.790
Feminism was about women liberating themselves,
right?

505
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:39.480
We can't do it for them.
We cannot do it for them.
Right?

506
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.300
So talking to men,

507
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.700
talking to those serial rapists about how bad they are and how bad this is,

508
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.990
what exactly is that going to accomplish?
A and B,
it's putting,

509
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.140
it's putting the responsibility on men and it's saying women must be saved,

510
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:56.670
which is like that is the soul of conservatism,
right?

511
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.160
To say that we must come save this,

512
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:04.161
our social inferiors that is like the essence of old school patriarchy and

513
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:05.760
conservatism.

514
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.870
It is to meet antifeminist to the bone and that's what no one is talking about

515
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.981
this.
Well,

516
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:14.970
this idea that the women can't consent because they've had a couple of drinks.

517
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.260
Is,
is a weird issue because there's clearly,
there's a scale,

518
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.850
there's a couple drinks where you're getting silly and you do you do you mean

519
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.150
you might fuck somebody's in a regretful way,
like say,
oh,

520
00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:29.040
I shouldn't have slept with that guy,
but it's not rape,

521
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.640
but they want to call that rape.
But then there's blackout drunk,
which is right.

522
00:29:32.641 --> 00:29:36.130
Sure.
And somewhere along the line it becomes reprehensible.
Absolutely.

523
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.590
It's three drinks in or four drinks in me.
Could,
it's debatable.
Sure.
Um,

524
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.810
do you know the bill and the,

525
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.180
<v 1>in the California legislature?</v>

526
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.820
That's about to be the law of the land is most likely no.
So yeah,

527
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:49.150
they're gonna there.
It's probably going to pass.
Um,

528
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.710
so that it's applied to all state schools in California,
um,

529
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.200
in which defines sexual assault and rape.
Uh,

530
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.210
in many ways that completely put all of us in the category of rapist because it

531
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:07.480
includes,
it includes having sex with someone when they're intoxicated.
Anyone.

532
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.353
Yeah.

533
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.900
<v 2>So your girlfriend,
boyfriend,
girlfriend,</v>

534
00:30:10.901 --> 00:30:13.810
have a couple of drinks and laughing and giggling and they make out they have

535
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:14.270
sex.

536
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.150
<v 1>Yeah.
And they don't even,
they don't even put a,
um,</v>

537
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.340
a sort of a threshold on how many drinks it takes.
So I'm,
you know,
senior,

538
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.500
I'm a serial rapist according to this.
Like we all are.

539
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.830
<v 2>Yeah.
And what his intoxication,
there's intoxication.</v>

540
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:31.040
That's the limit of alcohol intoxication when you're driving,

541
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:34.790
which a lot of people were debating is too low that that would be legally

542
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:35.630
applied to sex.

543
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.690
<v 1>Right.
So there's another thing that's very easy.</v>

544
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.340
One of the things I do is I sort of tried to expose how conservative a lot of

545
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:45.250
the left is because they don't even don't even realize it.
This is,

546
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.300
this is really conservative,
right?
So it's like,
it's micromanaging our sex lives.

547
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.840
Um,
and you know,
it's saying that sex,

548
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.490
that the state must come in and protect us from each other and it must,

549
00:30:57.491 --> 00:31:01.990
the state must come in or the college administration must protect women from

550
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:06.530
these,
from Saks,
well from demons and the demons are the nails,
the nails,

551
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.350
but not just demons from sex itself.
Like sex is seen as this sort of dangerous,

552
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:14.920
harmful thing.
It's,
it's,
it's sort of set apart from everything else in the war

553
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.880
<v 2>all especially then if you say,
even if you,</v>

554
00:31:17.881 --> 00:31:21.180
it's consensual and you're conscious and you're awake and you enjoy it and you

555
00:31:21.181 --> 00:31:22.260
have fun.
If you're in town,

556
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.630
<v 1>it is rape.
Yeah,
the con,
that's why that,
because it's sad.</v>

557
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.320
That case in Occidental that you raised,
I mean,
so they say,

558
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:32.560
and I've read the whole report,
okay.
By the college,

559
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.480
the report says by the College,
this was consensual sex.
Okay.
Period.

560
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.790
And when I read that,
I said,
okay,
case closed.

561
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.500
Then I read that he gets expelled because they were both drunk.
Eh.
You know,

562
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.330
I don't know what to say about that other than this is lunacy and it's,
it's,

563
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.050
but it's also,
it's deeply conservative and right.

564
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.920
<v 2>But he's also deeply sexist.</v>

565
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.180
[inaudible] how's the guy get expelled and the girl does and deeply sexist.

566
00:31:57.181 --> 00:32:01.020
Exactly.
Right.
That's sexist.
I agree.
It's crazy.
I mean,
no,
look,

567
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.470
no one got hurt.
There were kids that liked each other.

568
00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:06.150
They were attracted to each other and they had sex.

569
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.820
They were communicating with each other back and forth through text.

570
00:32:08.821 --> 00:32:12.270
It wasn't like she didn't like this guy.
It wasn't like,
yeah,

571
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.350
she was most certainly drunk.
But she also was saying,
nor friend,

572
00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:17.890
I'm going to go have sex with this guy.
Right.

573
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.160
The fact that that's not an open and shut case,

574
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.510
it exposes the lunacy of this ideology that exposed to the,

575
00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:29.910
the vast majority of intelligent adult Americans.
They would just,

576
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.610
they would put their foot down and go,
wait,
wait,
what the fuck did you just say?

577
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.140
What's going on?
I totally agree.
This is a bubble.
This ideologies is weird.

578
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.220
It is a bubble.
Yeah,
I agree.
I mean,
it's,
I think it's mostly

579
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.170
<v 1>hysteria.
Um,
however,
look,
you know why we agree,</v>

580
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.340
you know,
rape happens.
Yeah.
Acquaintance rape happens.
Yes.
Husbands,
rape wives,

581
00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.120
boyfriends,
rape girlfriends all the time,
right?
It's very,
it's friends,
right?

582
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:55.340
Boyfriend,
boyfriends or people,
oh,
well you want to talk about prison?

583
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:57.680
So you know that men get raped more often than women in this culture,

584
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.660
but the rate by men.
So it's really,
it's kind of a moot point.
How's that shows?

585
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:06.230
Men are pieces of shit each other.
Well,
sure.
When there's no women to rape,

586
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:09.920
we just rape the rape rates in prison are absolutely horrifying and

587
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:13.730
underreported.
Yeah,
no,
but so what do we do about it?
Right?
And so here's the,

588
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.810
here's sort of the intrinsic problem with rape and especially acquaintance rape.

589
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.040
There's very rarely any evidence,
there's very rarely eye witnesses.

590
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.860
There's very rarely physical evidence.
Even if there is physical evidence,

591
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:28.340
you can't prove that that bruise proves that this guy raped.
Right?

592
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.470
So what do you do?
Right?

593
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:33.110
It's a tough question and I understand that that's what people are kind of

594
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:36.110
trying to struggle with and are trying to come up with these new what devices to

595
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:39.050
stop it from happening.
I think the devices that are coming up with are terrible,

596
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.920
but what do we do?
And you know,
um,
so one thing,
I mean,

597
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:45.410
you got to keep working on the criminal justice system.

598
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:49.190
You got to get cops to like processed those rape kits more efficiently,

599
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:50.930
which they're not doing in many states.

600
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:53.090
There's a lot of rape kits that are sitting on shelves that have never been

601
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:56.300
processed.
And you've got to make,
you know,
cops just better at this,

602
00:33:56.301 --> 00:33:59.570
which is what feminists have been doing.
My mother in the 1960s,

603
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.480
that was one of the things she did as a feminist in Berkeley.
She,

604
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.010
she pushed hard.

605
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.820
She protested against the police force in the bay area at police forces in the

606
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:12.290
bay area to take rape seriously,
which cops didn't do for forever until then.

607
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.990
So do,
that's one thing.
And the other thing is
you'll like this.
I mean,
I,

608
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.450
I've been,
I say Jujitsu man.
Seriously.
I mean like,

609
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.220
and the inability to throw an elbow,
I mean,
and there's a group called insight,

610
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.640
which is women,
women of color against violence who have been doing this.

611
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:31.730
They have,
they have martial arts classes,
they have martial arts schools.

612
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.810
They organize together and they kicked the shit out of men who tried to attack

613
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:38.870
them.
Um,
now that's not the ultimate answer.
That's not gonna.

614
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.790
That's not going to get rid of all rapists,

615
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:45.830
but at least partial solution leave.
You believe me,

616
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:48.050
if I had a daughter,
I'd be telling her to do that.

617
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.390
<v 2>Yeah.
I do have daughters.
I teach.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean it's,</v>

618
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.730
it's one of those weird subjects to where if you discuss it,

619
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:58.450
you become a rape apologist.
You become,
I mean,

620
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.460
you're not even allowed to deviate from the ideology if you deviate from it in

621
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:08.480
any way,
shape or form.
It's,
it's,
you know,
it's a very strict dogma.

622
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.410
Yeah.
I mean you,

623
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.030
this is non consensual because she can't consent because she's had a drink.

624
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.980
Even if the guy has,
I've even seen it written that lady's like,
Oh,

625
00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:23.720
a feminist wrote this blog saying women don't have sex with your man if he's

626
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:28.220
drunk because he can't consent,
which is the most ridiculous shit ever.
I mean,

627
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.100
it's just the whole idea being that sex is eve.
Exactly.
And that's,

628
00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:34.490
that's really what it comes down to.

629
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:38.520
You're not talking about people getting hurt if they decided to get and wrestle.

630
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.780
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
is that assault right?
What is that?
If they both decide,
you know,</v>

631
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:46.970
if a guy and a girl,
you know,
take martial arts together and the guy,
you know,
uh,

632
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.620
in the girl or drinking and the girl wants a wrestle,

633
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.610
is she not allowed to consent that she actually wants to wrestle because she's

634
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:58.230
been drinking.
It's only applied to sexuality.
It's not applied to driving.

635
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:02.130
If you're driving under the influence,
you are absolutely,
totally responsible.

636
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.080
If you're smashed,
no one says,
hey,

637
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.520
she couldn't consent to driving because she was drunk.
You're,

638
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.450
you're responsible for your actions entirely except sexually.
Yup.

639
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.400
This comes back to what I started talking about,

640
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:19.020
which is the cultural roots of our country,
which is puritanism so right.
I mean,

641
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:23.610
if you look at Puritans,
people in Plymouth Rock,
you know,

642
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:26.520
that's one of the things they talked about Ad Nauseum,

643
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:29.070
that sex is the devil's work,

644
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:34.071
that it is this special thing that is evil and harmful and damaging and must be

645
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:36.690
controlled more than anything else.

646
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.850
And that is run through our culture in various ways to the very present.

647
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.050
And I would say that a lot of what's going on in this sexual assault discourse,

648
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:49.470
stuff that we're talking about,
uh,
you see it there too,
that it's,

649
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.320
that's what's going on.
That there's this belief that,
you know,

650
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:56.580
if I had sex that I didn't really feel good about with my boyfriend or not,

651
00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.120
and we were really drunk and I woke up and I was like,
ah,
don't like this dude.

652
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:02.490
And this was not okay.
It's like,

653
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.970
I think people are trained to think that they're damaged,

654
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.050
that this is a really terrible thing that happened to them.
Um,

655
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.260
I don't know about that.
I mean,
it's a crazy thing.
And this goes to prostitution.

656
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:15.300
This is why prostitution is illegal,
right?

657
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.290
It's like we sell our bodies from money all the time.
You know?

658
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.050
That's what massage.
Yeah.
You're selling your body fucking MMA.

659
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:28.540
Is that intimate,
you know,
is that intimate?
Right?
I mean,
let's Jujitsu as well.

660
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.120
Competition.
Well,
but it's extremely intimate.
They're good analogies.

661
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:36.540
Massage because massage feels good.
No one wants to do it to you.

662
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:40.050
You pay them to do it.
And that becomes an occupation is very respected.
Yeah.

663
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.930
You know,
you talked to someone and I'm a massage therapist.
Oh,
that's cool.
Sure.

664
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:45.030
Exactly.
Yeah.
But there's all sorts of professions where,
you know,

665
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.810
we sell our bodies intimately.
You could even argue that's what we're doing now.

666
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:51.120
I mean,
you know,
it's like on my body is here are your buddies there?

667
00:37:51.121 --> 00:37:53.670
We're using our minds,
we're talking and this is the,
this is exploiting.

668
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:58.410
Our body's not going to be a stretch.
Okay.
Sorry.
And I teach when I teach,
I say,

669
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.440
yeah,
right.
I mean,
so I'm like,
I said to my students,
look,
I'm standing here.

670
00:38:01.441 --> 00:38:04.590
I brought my body here.
You're looking at me,
you're judging me.

671
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:08.220
It's like I'm using my body.
You're getting paid for this.
It's every job.

672
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:12.570
You're selling your body.
We draw a line of prostitution for some strange reason,

673
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.040
but I don't think it's a strange reason.

674
00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.570
I think it's appearance in Harrington and yeah,
man.

675
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:19.650
I think it's because we believe deep down that sexist special.
Yeah.
In a bad way.

676
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.210
Do you know Molly crab apples?
Yeah,
sure.
Very interesting woman for sex,

677
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:27.510
sex worker activist and not try to list,
yeah,
sure.
Her,
her,

678
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.040
her take on it as you know,
completely open minded.
She's like,
why?

679
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:36.130
Why is it bad?
You know?
She's like,
I have friends that are sex.
She goes,
sure.

680
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.430
And it's fine.
Like what did they like it?
They don't mind.

681
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:43.120
They have clients that they enjoy being with and they get paid for that.
Like,

682
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.750
isn't it better to do that than to do something you don't like and isn't it a

683
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:50.530
good thing to get sex,
right?
Yeah.
No,
I have,
I've worked with,

684
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:54.010
and I have friends who are in the sex worker activist sort of movement right
now.

685
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:56.890
And She's part of it.
I don't know her,
but she's a part of it.
And you know,

686
00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.880
the more common argument among them is it's not like we all love it,
right.

687
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.870
What it is for them is it's a job,
right?
It's a job.
And some of us like it,

688
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:09.730
like some of us,
like our jobs and some of us are don't like it.
Um,

689
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.250
and,
but that's it.
It's just a job for them.
Like porn stars asking,

690
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.430
ask it if you know anything about the porn industry,
the porn stars,

691
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:18.430
that's how they think of it when they go to work.
It's not like,
Oh hell yeah,

692
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:20.510
we're going to part.
It's just like,
ah,
okay,
right.

693
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.530
Got To get up at nine o'clock and I go to the set and I'm going to be there for

694
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:25.820
three hours and we're going to have lunch at noon and then,
you know,

695
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.600
and they'd come home.
Right.
I mean that's every,

696
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.990
every person in the porn industry I've ever known has said this about certainly

697
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:35.990
would,
it becomes once you do it for a while,
it becomes a job.
Right?
Yeah.

698
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.440
I think you're,
you're onto something.

699
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.160
I definitely think you're on to something when it comes to the puritan roots of

700
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:47.080
this idea that sex is evil and that kids,
you know,

701
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:51.820
away from their houses for the first time at 18 years of age having sex in a

702
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:52.720
dorm room.
Sure.

703
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.610
There's also the thing that happens to where the people that you communicate

704
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:00.970
with after the fact can tell you what a horrible thing has happened to you.

705
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.490
And they do it with like this rabbit intention.

706
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.380
And that was one of the parts of the story that I found quite fascinating.

707
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:13.240
Like the friends of the guy versus the friends of the girl,

708
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.650
like what their,
their take on it was and that the girl came over,

709
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:21.190
she was drunk.
The guy's friend saw her and they'll go,
yeah,

710
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:22.210
they were both fucked up.

711
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.530
They mean he had drank a half of a bottle of vodka and she drank countless beers

712
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:30.340
or whatever,
but the girl's friends were like,
what was definitely rape?

713
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.880
It was definitely sexually assault.
Yeah,

714
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.230
well it's even worse than that and now I'm really going to get fired.

715
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:37.930
One of the things that happens,

716
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:41.590
and it happened in this case from what we can tell from the evidence is that,
um,

717
00:40:41.591 --> 00:40:46.540
so the average reporting time for sexual assault on campuses is close to a year

718
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.890
after the,
after the alleged assault.
It's hundreds of days.
It's,
it's close to,

719
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:54.190
it's something at two or 300 a days is the average time it takes people to

720
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:58.090
report these things.
And we have lots of testimony of those people.

721
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:01.240
Those women saying,
saying that,
well,
I didn't really,

722
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.090
I didn't know at first what it was.
I didn't feel good about it,

723
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:05.080
but he didn't know what it was.

724
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:09.070
And then my professor started talking to me and that's what happened.

725
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:11.860
In this case we know pretty sure for were sure.

726
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.870
Pretty sure that a particular professor,

727
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.560
they're not only convinced her that it was rape,

728
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.670
but also did a demographic profiling of the guy and said,
well,

729
00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:25.210
he belongs to these particular demographic groups who are likely to be rapists.

730
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.510
Yeah.
What demographic groups or like all that?

731
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.900
That was one of the more amazing things.
He's a member of a team.
I forget.

732
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.730
I think it's either tennis or one of the,
I don't have one of the teams.

733
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:39.731
It's supposedly more likely to be full of rapist and other God and that he's was

734
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:42.740
a Valedictorian.
Yeah,
smart.

735
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:45.080
So He's more likely to be a rape because I guess they have a sense of

736
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:48.320
entitlement is the idea.
I don't know.
I don't even know what the argument is,

737
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.010
but that was,
it was in the press.
You can look it up.
Oh my God.

738
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:56.450
You can look it up.
Raisie foundation for individual rights and education,

739
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.210
fire,
awesome organization.
Everyone should support it.

740
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.120
They reported that if you look at their website you want so you can see that.

741
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:03.990
Yeah.
That's terrifying.
Yes.

742
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:08.960
It could be that boy who's come a Valedictorian because you've struggled through

743
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:13.961
high school and kicked ass and tried to get great grades and done your work and

744
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:18.140
studied and under the supervision of your parents and tutors and what have you,

745
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:20.510
and you were looking forward to having this great career.

746
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:24.770
And someone has looked at that hard work and said,
oh,
he's most likely a rapist.

747
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:29.600
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
it's,
it's very damaging.
That's terrifying.
I've read,
I've read many,

748
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:31.700
many accounts.
I've met many red,

749
00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:36.290
many accounts of these things where it's like hard to call it rape.

750
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.300
It's hard to call it rape.
What do you go to Jamie?
That the article,
Oh,

751
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:44.300
this is because he was from a good family.
Oh,
there it is.

752
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.550
Because he was from a good family.
He's more likely in quotes.

753
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.440
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
He was a Vac Valedictorian.

754
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.210
He was on a sports team and was from a good family.
So he's monk,

755
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.890
most likely a rapist.
How does someone keep a job when they have that,

756
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:05.630
that ideology and they promoted to kids.
So this is a colleague of mine,
so I,
I'm,

757
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.650
I'm really kinda constrained here.
But yeah,
it's,
you know what man,

758
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.100
that's a criminal,
that person's terrible person.

759
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.310
If anyone has said that to a young influential kid and that pointed,

760
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.600
this is what's more likely if a person's a rapist.

761
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.520
Did they use force?
Did they drug you?
Did they coerce you?

762
00:43:25.521 --> 00:43:29.380
Did something bad happened to you that makes a person a rapist?
Yes.

763
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.790
Not being from a fucking good family.

764
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.650
All non rapists come from broken homes.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

765
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.400
No I know non rapists got ds.
Yeah.
I think the legal definition is pretty good.

766
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:43.940
You know,
it's the,
it's the use of force or the threat of the use of force.

767
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.780
Correct.
All those accusations of that professor said to me,
is that pet,

768
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.670
that professor ever come out and confirmed these,
these statements,

769
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.080
her claims at that,
that,
that men like that are more likely to be racist?
Hell no,

770
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.650
of course not.
How could she,
okay,
so this is Jay.
That's,
it's absurd.
Yeah.
It's,

771
00:44:01.651 --> 00:44:04.370
I think,
I don't know what it goes away.
I can only guess where it comes from.

772
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:09.371
I think that the men at Occidental who have been accused of sexual assault over

773
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:14.390
the last few years,
I think I'm guessing belong to those categories now.

774
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:18.740
That's just accusations though.
It's so crazy.
And we're also,
by the way,

775
00:44:18.741 --> 00:44:21.830
talking about,
I don't know,
10 or 20 people.

776
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:26.680
So that is so fucking crazy.
Yeah.
And it's one of the,

777
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:31.350
and also,
you know,
one of the,
one of the most enraging things about,
and I,

778
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.070
you know,
I've talked

779
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.090
<v 2>to people who were actually victims of rape about this,
right.</v>

780
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:40.480
And they are fucking furious because it,
it,
it,
it,

781
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.630
it trivializes what happened to them and it also makes it much harder to report

782
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:47.040
rape.
It makes it much more harder.

783
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.370
It makes it much harder to take people for people to take seriously what

784
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:54.360
happened to them.
It's an ultimate cry wolf scenario.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

785
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:59.010
so you gotta,
you gotta be really disciplined about your definition of it,

786
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.440
of sexual assault and rape.
It's the use of force,

787
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.060
the threat of the use of force or having sex with someone who is incapacitated.

788
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:10.020
And that is it.
And I think that's good enough.
That is good enough.

789
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:14.930
And I also think we should enforce like hell that absolutely,
you know,

790
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:19.380
and in all sorts of ways,
right.
So,
but that's it.
Yeah,
absolutely.

791
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.410
And I also think that there's an issue with influencing people's ideas of the

792
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:27.750
past,
influencing their memory.
I mean,

793
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:31.800
one of the worst pieces of evidence you would know this as good as anybody is

794
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.840
eye witness accounts.
They're terrible when you,
when you,
you ask people like,

795
00:45:36.841 --> 00:45:41.190
I've talked to friends about scenarios that I was involved in where,

796
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:45.260
and they'll give you a take on it and you go and I'll go,
no,
you didn't do that.

797
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:49.620
Mike did that,
right?
Don't you remember?
And they'll go,
oh yeah,
fuck yeah,
dude,

798
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:53.490
we were in Chicago.
We had to go to that.
We have to do that show.
Remember?

799
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.970
Oh yeah.
Fuck right.

800
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.620
You were telling a crazy story about Vegas that didn't even happen in Vegas.

801
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.890
And it wasn't even the guy you were talking about,
but you were so fucking sure.

802
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.820
Right.
And it only happened six months ago.
I mean that is so common on,

803
00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.840
and I'm not trivializing traumatic incidences that really get etched into

804
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:12.600
people's consciousness,

805
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:17.160
but there is a reality that eye witness accounts are very difficult to cooperate

806
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.360
because people,
their memories suck is human memory.
And um,
and I've,

807
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.570
I've said this on this podcast may times my memory is dog shit,

808
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.840
but it's really good.
Like for a person it's really good.

809
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:32.700
Like I can pull things out of the past.
Um,
I'm like my MMA documentary,

810
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.620
my MMA,
a memory rather.
It's fantastic.
I can recall fights from,

811
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.130
I've noticed decades ago off the top of my head.
I'm not using any notes.

812
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:45.300
I can just,
sure.
But if you,
you asked me to break down day by day,

813
00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:48.360
what happened yesterday,
right.
Fuck,
it's a flashes.

814
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:52.770
It's like I see like snapshots,
a barely remember what I ate.

815
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.200
I barely remember where I went first.
I mean,

816
00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:57.970
I didn't have to concentrate and think about it.
Right?
Well there's us,

817
00:46:57.971 --> 00:46:59.760
his subjectivity,
right?
And interpretation.

818
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:03.360
So you and I could watch the exact same thing happened right in front of us

819
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:05.490
right now and have a different interpretation of what happened.

820
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:09.590
And having someone who's an influential person talk to you about those events

821
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.490
that will shape your perception of them.

822
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.400
So it's really egregious to convince someone that that a terrible thing has

823
00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:16.650
happened to them when they're not sure that it's happened to them.
Right.

824
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.150
Is there,

825
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:21.240
what does the vested interest in making sure that this person decides a terrible

826
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:22.021
things happening?
I mean,

827
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:25.980
this is is you're dealing with people that don't like men.

828
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.230
Are you dealing with people that don't like young boys?

829
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:32.230
Are you dealing with people that don't like masculine sexuality and they're

830
00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:35.520
trying to suppress it in any form possible so to,

831
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:40.030
to mute or neuter men in this way to make it so they're terrified to have sex

832
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:44.590
with someone unless they have like written consent during various stages of the

833
00:47:44.591 --> 00:47:45.520
sexual act.

834
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.300
I would like to record on record that we're about to have sex and you are sober

835
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:52.090
or you sober.
Is that correct?
Yes.
Okay.
Let's proceed.

836
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.910
<v 1>Yeah.
I really,</v>

837
00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:57.900
I'm really hesitant about going from motivations and these things when it's

838
00:47:57.901 --> 00:48:01.410
about politics because people do that to me all the time.
Right?
Oh,

839
00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:03.240
you made that argument because you're a racist.
Oh,

840
00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:04.730
you made that argument because you're a man.
Oh,

841
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.620
you hit made that argument because your mom wasn't good to you.
Whatever.

842
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:13.440
Check your privilege.
That is,
oh boy.
It's all the time.
Um,

843
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.530
so I,
um,

844
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.490
however it's been shown that men named fattiest have a lot of privilege too,

845
00:48:20.491 --> 00:48:23.280
by the way,
cause sure,
man,
it means great.
Leader did,

846
00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.650
uh,
um,
well there is this,

847
00:48:28.651 --> 00:48:31.320
there is this sort of phenomenon that some of us have identified,

848
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.070
which we call the white savior complex.
Um,

849
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.080
which you remember Kony 2012.
Yes.
Good Lord.

850
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.120
That's like the greatest example of that.
How did that fucking vantage quick?

851
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.140
Yeah.
Well,
for good reason,
but that's kind of like the greatest example of that.

852
00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.530
Uh,
really a really awesome writer named Taizhou Cole.

853
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.340
I'm not sure how he pronounces his name that way,
but it's tee Jay,
you Cole,

854
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.970
amazing writer.
He's actually a fiction writer,
but he,
he,
he's,

855
00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:00.840
he talked about the Kony 2012 and the white savior complex,
which,
you know,

856
00:49:00.841 --> 00:49:05.520
and this is a lot of my work is on this.
It's,
um,
it's mostly white people,

857
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.650
almost all elite people.

858
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:13.430
It is almost entirely western European and American people who take it upon

859
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:17.550
themselves to save,
save their social inferiors right.

860
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.540
And they want to go out and find them first of all,
find their,
find these poor,

861
00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.400
sad people in the world,
wherever they may be,

862
00:49:23.401 --> 00:49:28.401
whether it's in the ghetto in Compton or whether it's in Rwanda or wherever,

863
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:32.490
and go save them and change their lives and uplift them and make them more like

864
00:49:32.491 --> 00:49:34.860
us.
Um,
it's,
it's sort of the,

865
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.160
it is the psychological and cultural core of imperialism and to me it has led to

866
00:49:40.291 --> 00:49:43.950
the deaths of millions of people.
So,
you know,

867
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.540
what had Koni 12 results in it literally resulted in I think 500 us servicemen

868
00:49:48.541 --> 00:49:51.280
being on the ground,
shooting people.
Now you could say it,

869
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:55.240
that was necessary to save those kids from that guy.
Uh,
and just so,

870
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.020
so just so happens historically,
it almost never ends it that right.

871
00:49:58.021 --> 00:50:00.930
It almost always ends in something else.
A bigger war,

872
00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.820
bigger shooting war erupts because of this.

873
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.330
And now we need to conquer the whole country as in Iraq.
Right?

874
00:50:06.331 --> 00:50:10.980
That was a humanitarian mission.
Remember that was to save the Iraqis.
Yeah.

875
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.113
Not Exactly.

876
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.380
So how many Iraqis have died just to save them something like a million.
Right?

877
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:21.120
It's debatable,
but hell of a lot.
It's at least 200,000 to be as many.

878
00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.910
But the thing about it,
it's to killing them,
to save them.
Right.

879
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.770
Which was what was said about Vietnam.

880
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:30.260
So that was kind of this classic line by a general in Vietnam.
He said,

881
00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:34.520
we have to,
we have to destroy the village in order to save it.
Right.

882
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.360
But anyway,
so that's that idea.
It's also this very arrogant,

883
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:42.620
paternalistic impulse that's a lot of people have in particular a lot of white

884
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:46.520
people,
but certainly elite people can.
White people I know hate white people.

885
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.010
I'm glad you're with me on this and I want to talk about ludicrous with you.

886
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:52.310
By the way,
we got to talking about ludicrous.
Okay.
Yeah.
But um,

887
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.270
your bid on ludicrous.
Yeah.
You're like,
what and what was that?
Okay.

888
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:01.280
White people.
Um,
no,
it's true.
So,
okay,

889
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:02.870
so you think that,

890
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.140
so the same sort of motivation that people have to do this 2012 Coney thing

891
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.820
cause the same motivation that they have to cry rape.
Well,

892
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:17.210
to encourage people to,
so because you need to have a victim,

893
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:18.470
you need to have someone who's suffering.

894
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.240
You need to have someone who's oppressed,
right.
To save them.
Right.

895
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.460
So you gotta you gotta make sure they exist and so you have to create that

896
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.470
discourse,
that way of thinking about them.

897
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:31.040
And because this young man had a lot going from Ge,

898
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:34.310
from a good family and a Valedictorian,
except you have an oppressor,

899
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:37.620
he's an apprentice to vanquish,
obviously privileged.
Yeah.

900
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.780
Sokoni was the oppressor who had to be vanquished to save the kids there.

901
00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.730
Uh,
yeah,
I think it's this,
I think I can't,
I don't want to speak for,

902
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.720
I don't want to speak for what's going on in her mind,

903
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:52.550
but I do think it does line up with Kony 2012,
uh,
that there's,

904
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.170
you have to create an oppressor.
You have to create an,

905
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:58.100
a victim in order to save them so that you become the,
the night,
the white night.

906
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.600
Well,
how do they justify the,
the boy being responsible,

907
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:05.500
but the girl not being responsible.
Yeah.

908
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.520
So that's to me fundamentally antifeminist yeah.

909
00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:12.290
And Conservative as hell.
Right?
Because it is,

910
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:17.291
it says that a man can make decisions,

911
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:21.830
can have agency when he's drunk,
but a woman cannot,

912
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:25.580
she's a victim.
She's going to be a victim.
So women can't control themselves.

913
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.450
They can't determine their own lives when they're drunk,
but men can,
right.

914
00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:31.550
That's,
that's like,
that's like a fucking done.

915
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.200
Don Draper says on mad men about women and say,
Oh,
well,
you know,
they're just,

916
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:39.290
they're dumb and they can't control themselves when they've had a couple drinks.

917
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.990
Uh,
excuse me.
I don't think so.
I mean,
you know,
I think there's,

918
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.600
there's also said that just like a check by the way,
did,
excuse me.

919
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:48.520
I don't think so.
Oh good.

920
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.620
I say I just saved my job then.
Well,

921
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.400
if you get fired for what you said,
the world is really fucked.

922
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.360
I mean the academic,
well that's not exactly why I got fired,

923
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.480
but we didn't know you can get into that,
which has to do with the ludicrous.

924
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.780
Seriously.
Yeah.
I mean not,
yeah.
Basically.
Basically the,

925
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:10.970
your bit about ludicrous is,
is actually is,
is very,

926
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:14.090
very similar to a big argument I made,
which is the reason I got fired.

927
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:18.460
And what was the argument?
Okay,
so this is about race
and,

928
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.410
and then your bit,
actually I don't think you do.
I don't think he,

929
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.490
did you connect it to race?
Did you see that?
It's like,
yeah,
you didn't.
Right.

930
00:53:24.491 --> 00:53:25.530
So that's another,
yeah,

931
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.710
it was just about people enjoying themselves and that there's,

932
00:53:29.711 --> 00:53:34.350
there's a lot of music that's just so fucking depressing and it's just like,

933
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.740
like,
uh,
like that hey there Delilah song,

934
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.850
which was not even apparently about a girl that this guy dated,

935
00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:45.270
which has even creep and really,
yeah.
So it's about girl that he knew.

936
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:45.811
So it was good.

937
00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:48.480
It was probably like moving to New York to get the fuck away from this guy.

938
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.460
Right.
He's writing this song.
He did.
Yeah.
I thought it wasn't,

939
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:54.510
I mean,
you didn't say this,

940
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:59.310
but I thought it's not a coincidence that a lot of white rock like that is very

941
00:53:59.311 --> 00:54:01.860
depressing.
Very email.
Yeah.
But it's depressing.

942
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:04.890
You were saying it's depressing and like salad or even saying,
well,
we are,

943
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.210
what we're attracted to is like the melancholy of it.
Um,

944
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.240
and then depth.
There's depth in being somber.

945
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.370
We think there's done whatever we think we value that we think,
oh,

946
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:20.670
well he must be a deep person.
You know,
deep thinker with real feelings.

947
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.150
He's a human being.
He's a fully realized human being upon.
Yes.

948
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.410
He understands complex stance,
essence of human humanity.

949
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.460
He's not having fun and smiling cause that people are starving.
Yeah,
exactly.

950
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.850
Exactly.
There,
there are more important things to do than have fun.
Yeah.

951
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.790
But that's not so that's exactly what you're getting at.
Yeah.
So like so,

952
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.590
so the fact that you compare it to him and it was at the,

953
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.160
where do they call those dirty white single white tea,
what is it called?

954
00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.240
The white tees.
Yeah.
They're white dudes.
Right.
And then,

955
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.130
and with ludicrous.
Right.

956
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:55.140
And his celebration of rims and barbecues and asses.

957
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.280
Right.
Um,
I mean this is,
this is my work.
This is,

958
00:54:58.281 --> 00:55:02.040
this is like the core of my work,
believe it or not.
Perfect.
So,
um,
yeah,

959
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:05.040
when I saw God's work,
I was watching it with my 12 year old son.
You're special.

960
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:09.120
And
I was like,
totally.
Do you see that?
He just said what he'd done.
He was like,

961
00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:13.620
yeah,
I think I get it.
I like ludicrous a little bit.

962
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:18.390
Um,
I said,
okay dad.
No,
it's um,
yeah,

963
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:23.190
it's so much of American culture from the beginning has been defined in that
way.

964
00:55:23.191 --> 00:55:27.990
So like,
you know,
white people have sort of prided themselves on being,
you know,

965
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:32.670
very serious and upright and disciplined and controlled and,
uh,

966
00:55:32.671 --> 00:55:36.170
and therefore they should be the president,
right?
Or the CIO or you know,

967
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:40.530
the professor.
Right.
Um,
and they are the good puritans right at the,

968
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:43.260
invented this shit.
And they adhered to it more than others.

969
00:55:43.261 --> 00:55:45.630
Not Perfectly of course,
but they adhere to it more than others.

970
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:49.140
And they always took that as a source of pride.
Right?
Yeah.
Man,

971
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:51.150
we're still repressed.
Yeah.
We don't,

972
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.840
we don't run around naked and fucking in the bushes and,
you know,
we don't,

973
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.250
we work hard.
You know,

974
00:55:56.251 --> 00:56:01.251
we believe that work is a good thing as opposed to those other people.

975
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.520
Right.
People we brought here from Africa who didn't have those ideas,
right.

976
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.210
They're always just naked who's trans.

977
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:12.300
They dance and they don't think that work in itself is godly.

978
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:14.400
That's the Protestant work ethic,
by the way.
It's not,

979
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.460
not work as a means to an end,
which makes sense to all of us.

980
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:19.140
You got to get shit.
You got to work hard.

981
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.740
The Protestant or puritan work ethic is we're,
and this is what they said,

982
00:56:22.741 --> 00:56:25.420
work in itself is good.
No matter what you get for it,
you don't get,

983
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.910
if you don't get paid at all,
if you don't make anything out of it,
it's still,

984
00:56:27.911 --> 00:56:30.730
you should work.
Right.
That's what they've always said,
right?

985
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:33.790
So you get valourized for just working hard even if you get nothing for it.

986
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.380
So that's been kind of this kind of to me in a lot of historians has been kind

987
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:41.950
of like the central cultural split in our,
in our,
in our country for 400,

988
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:45.730
500 years,
um,
between those two.
And you kind of nailed it and that bit,

989
00:56:45.731 --> 00:56:47.400
and I was kind of stunned.
I was like,
oh my God,
he's started,

990
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.650
gets all that you didn't,
you didn't connect it to race.
Um,

991
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.840
but the roots of it,
and this is in my book,
this is what I do with it.
You know,
I,

992
00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.460
I tried to find the roots of it.
I'm like,
how did this happen?

993
00:56:57.461 --> 00:57:01.240
That black people created jazz and rock and roll?
Is that just a coincidence?

994
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.650
A lot of standup comedy and comedy.
Right.
So Richard,
yeah.

995
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.040
Not really like Lenny Bruce is the real godfather of comedy.
He's the,
the,

996
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:11.470
he needs a Jew.
He was the real God,

997
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.150
but he was doing heroin with black jazz singer.
Exactly.
I mean he's,

998
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.640
he's hanging around with exactly a lot of beat poets and they were hanging

999
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:22.550
around with a lot of jazz singers.
They were smoking marijuana with,
you know,

1000
00:57:22.551 --> 00:57:26.590
a lot of black guys.
It was,
yeah,
it was a cultural infusion there.

1001
00:57:26.591 --> 00:57:30.340
There was a lot going on and it was one of the reasons why a lot of his
subjects,

1002
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.540
one of his more prominent subjects had to do with race.
Right?
Yeah.

1003
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:38.380
A Chitlin circuit preceded him.
Moms Mabley preceded him.
Red Fox,

1004
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.440
I think was the same time.
And I think before him as well.
So yeah,

1005
00:57:41.441 --> 00:57:45.700
I agree with you.
But prior was the god of fire and he came out of Lenny Bruce.

1006
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.910
Yeah.
Yeah.
You think so?
Yeah.
He very,

1007
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:53.170
very strongly influenced by him and discussed it in great,
great length.
Really.

1008
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:56.740
Prior to that he had seen Lenny Bruce several times in the village.

1009
00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.310
And there was a Lenny,
Bruce was the original.
This is pretty,

1010
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.240
pretty much everybody agrees with that when it comes to standup comedy prior was

1011
00:58:04.241 --> 00:58:07.570
influenced by him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody was well,
okay,
that's fine.

1012
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:10.950
I still have an argument for that.
Which Jews,
right?
Yeah.

1013
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.200
And she was absolutely Jews and blacks have dominated stand up forever.
Right.

1014
00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.580
You know,
um,
um,
why?
Right.
So here's,

1015
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.860
so here's why blacks have and,
and you know,
so it's,

1016
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.520
it's not just comedy and it's particular kind of comedy,
right.
It's like,
it's,

1017
00:58:24.521 --> 00:58:28.810
you know,
it's,
there's fun loose body,
um,
you know,

1018
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:31.360
saying things you're not supposed to say light company,
you know,

1019
00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:34.900
talking about fucking in the 1950s and sixties when you definitely weren't

1020
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:39.490
supposed to do it.
Then taking drugs,
you know,
and like making light of that,

1021
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:42.430
that was not okay.
Lenny Lenny was the martyr for that.
Right.

1022
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:43.750
And he went to jail for that shit.
Right.

1023
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:47.050
So he didn't really talk about it onstage prior really talked prior.

1024
00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:51.640
They plug it in and just blew it up.
Yeah.
Prayers is my major influence.

1025
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.790
People when people ask me like an academic conferences like soon as your major

1026
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:57.460
influence.
And I'm like,
well Michel Foucault and Richard Pryor.
And they're like,

1027
00:58:57.461 --> 00:59:00.280
what?
It's true though,
it's absolutely true.

1028
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:04.210
When I saw live in concert was 13,
12 or 12 years old.

1029
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.180
I first of all fell out of my chair and the theater and I was like,

1030
00:59:07.181 --> 00:59:10.410
that changed my life.
Me Too,
because he,
one of the things,

1031
00:59:10.411 --> 00:59:13.300
one of the many things he did was I think he was the first person to do this

1032
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.340
first black person to do this in public on a stage.

1033
00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.400
He made fun of white people and suggested that they were actually inferior.

1034
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.980
Like that did not happen before.

1035
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.530
Like imitating them and putting them down and sort of suggesting,
not suggesting,

1036
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:29.380
basically saying,
yeah man,
like they're layer.
There's Nice sock.

1037
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:32.960
Yeah.
He has this great bit.
It's not in live in concert.
It's in a smaller piece.

1038
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.220
Um,
he's like,
it says something like a man,
a white people,
white people,

1039
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:41.300
white people be doing yoga.
Niggas be fucking right.
And it's like,

1040
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:44.810
that sums it up.
Right.
And so,
um,

1041
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.430
but so slavery.
Okay.
All right.
Can we do slavery?
Sure.
Okay.

1042
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.470
Now I'm going to get fired like four times.

1043
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.900
Can only fire you want and you're going to get in trouble too.

1044
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.140
How can I be in trouble if you agree with me?
Okay.

1045
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.510
I'm gonna agree with you already.
How about that?
Cool.
All right,
so here it is.

1046
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.110
So yeah,

1047
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:08.111
if you got to understand like puritanism and American culture from Plymouth rock

1048
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.720
all the way through the 19th century first.
Okay.

1049
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:16.130
Which was unbelievably repressive.
Okay.
And this is,

1050
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.640
everyone agrees on this,
right?
It was like comically repressive.
Uh,

1051
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.180
this first surgeon general,
the United States,

1052
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:27.320
Benjamin Rush wrote these books about how masturbation caused blindness and

1053
01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:28.670
death in epilepsy.

1054
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.740
There were just like medical journals were full of this shit about how sex was

1055
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:37.640
terrible and would kill you and cause paralysis and all this stuff.

1056
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:40.790
One of the fastest growing industries in the early 19th century,

1057
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:44.540
right after the United States is founded was for devices to stop people from

1058
01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:45.374
masturbating.

1059
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:50.410
So like chain mail mitts for men and these hobbles that kept women's legs

1060
01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:54.740
together.
Well,
they had a lock and key and then chastity belt,

1061
01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:57.050
everybody knows about that.
All these devices.

1062
01:00:57.051 --> 01:01:01.340
It was just this amazingly like comically repressive culture around sex and then

1063
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:02.330
also around work.

1064
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:06.740
So the puritan work ethic that work is good no matter what you get for it.

1065
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.490
And you're doing the devil's work if you're not working.
Um,

1066
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.960
was in like five year old children's textbooks,
kindergarteners,

1067
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:19.460
we're taught that playing with their toys was the devil's work and they were

1068
01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:24.290
taught to be useful in their lives and then to find a profession and a vocation

1069
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.950
when they're in kindergarten.
Right.
And it just suffused the whole society.

1070
01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:29.630
So like every political leader,

1071
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:32.690
every business leader and certainly all the religious leaders,

1072
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:35.780
everybody and novels that were written,

1073
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:40.781
poetry is just all about work all the time to be godly and never have sex.

1074
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.650
Even in marriage,

1075
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.890
there was even a lot of talk through the 19th century about even,

1076
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.570
even having sex with your wife was dangerous at best.
Like you did it,

1077
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.380
you did it because you had to,
to procreate to make more Americans.

1078
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.450
But that was it.
Like you gotta be really careful.

1079
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:59.240
You can't let it get out of hand.
Beyond that,
you've got to just,
yeah,

1080
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:01.970
so this is an historians all agree on this.
It was just a phenomenal,

1081
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:03.800
so this is Victorianism,
right?

1082
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.920
This is like when puritanism moves into Victorianism,
right?

1083
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:08.620
What was the cause of all that?
What?

1084
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.540
That's an awesome question I had no one can answer.
I mean,
what is the,

1085
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.900
what is the cause of a culture emerging?
I don't know.
I mean one thing,

1086
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.130
one of the more common,
one of the most common explanations is industrial,

1087
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.090
right?
So this is,
this is also the time of the first factories.
You know,

1088
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:27.600
and this is the time when people are moving from the farms into cities and

1089
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.180
working in sort of industrial capitalist formats,
right?

1090
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:32.460
Where they're sitting at a table and there's a division of labor and you put

1091
01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:36.090
together the,
the machinery or the shoe piece by piece and Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1092
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.250
So that required or you know,
that requires a lot of discipline,
right?

1093
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.490
It requires getting people to stop drinking and stop fornicating and to,

1094
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.880
you know,
be committed to work as a good thing.
I'm not sure that's,

1095
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:48.990
I mean that's a decent explanation.

1096
01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:52.530
I'm not sure if that really explains it entirely.
Um,
first of all,

1097
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:53.840
cause it Kinda preexists it,
you know,

1098
01:02:53.841 --> 01:02:56.650
the puritans were way before all that happened.
Um,

1099
01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.340
and they were talking about that for centuries before there was industrial

1100
01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:03.450
capitalism,
but it was this crazy repressive culture that Americans lived in.

1101
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:03.591
It's,

1102
01:03:03.591 --> 01:03:07.740
it's funny for us to look at now the things that they were saying at the time

1103
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:10.010
and doing at the time,
but it was just,
can you,

1104
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.280
I just hard to imagine living like that.
Um,
okay.
So that was kind of,

1105
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:17.000
and that was also considered to be what white people do,
you know,
that's,

1106
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.430
it was a,
it was totally racialized.
Right?
So it's like white good Americans,

1107
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:24.030
white meaning white people do that.
They don't fuck.
And they work.

1108
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.710
They pretty simple and Kurt's over their piano legs.
Yeah.
And also,
I mean,

1109
01:03:29.711 --> 01:03:31.940
and that kind of extended to dancing.
So there's,
I have a,

1110
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.560
I have a whole section in my book on dancing.
And so like,

1111
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:38.880
it was terrible to dance,
to dance in American culture if you're a white person.

1112
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:44.250
Um,
leisure was bad.
It's all bad.
So that's how,
that's where everyone lived.

1113
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:49.251
And then along come these people from this other place called West Africa where

1114
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:53.670
none of these ideas existed.
Like the Protestant work ethic was like,

1115
01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:54.680
what are you talking about?

1116
01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:58.230
It just a purely northern European and American invention,
you know,

1117
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.170
very few people in world history of us subscribe to that idea.

1118
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.060
So the west Africans come over here.

1119
01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:06.000
They also believed and moving your body as a good thing.
You know,

1120
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.910
it was a beautiful thing to them moving it and sensual ways,

1121
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:12.090
dancing and otherwise they didn't believe that sex outside of marriage was

1122
01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:15.540
wicked.
It was going to destroy your life,
especially for women.

1123
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:18.480
They thought that women who had sex outside of marriage were fine,

1124
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.600
that it was no problem.
Uh,

1125
01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.920
they come over here and then as slaves they have zero of course incentive to

1126
01:04:27.871 --> 01:04:32.180
internalize,
to adopt this white person's culture.
Right?
Um,

1127
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:35.940
not only that is sort of physically barred from it,
right?
So there,

1128
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.940
so citizenship,
they're not given citizenship,
right?

1129
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.460
And that's not good because you don't get to vote and you don't get equal

1130
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:44.070
protection under the law.
And all those good things that come with citizenship.

1131
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:47.490
What people miss about it is that in this column here and everywhere,

1132
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:50.310
citizenship is also a cultural thing,
right?

1133
01:04:50.311 --> 01:04:53.820
You're considered a good American if you do particular things right.

1134
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:58.710
And in that case it meant putting your body in a walking prison,
right?

1135
01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:02.970
That's what a good citizen did.
A good white person.
So slaves were here,

1136
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.130
they brought elements of this west African culture that thought that sex was

1137
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.970
okay and that work was a means to an end.
And that was it.

1138
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.360
Uh,
and they had no incentive to adopt this insane,

1139
01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:18.760
repressive culture that the white were all about.

1140
01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.740
And so they developed their own,

1141
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.980
which wasn't west African and it wasn't American.

1142
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:27.580
It was this new thing called Africa,
which we now call African American culture.

1143
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.400
And that is what gave us jazz man.
And you know,
because what is jazz?

1144
01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:35.710
Jazz is the music of improvisation.
It's the music,

1145
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:37.090
it's been called the music of freedom.

1146
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.440
You take this musical structure and then the soloists does what he wants for a

1147
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:44.950
moment and he goes out of the structure and is free.

1148
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:47.170
He's liberated from the structure and then comes back into it.

1149
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:49.120
It's the music of improvisation and freedom.

1150
01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:52.690
I don't think it's a coincidence that people who were separated from that

1151
01:05:52.691 --> 01:05:55.330
ridiculously repressive culture created that music.

1152
01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:58.120
White people never could have created that ever.

1153
01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.130
But that is absolutely fascinating.

1154
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:05.131
So how much has influenced our culture that has come out of the people that were

1155
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:08.530
brought over here as slaves?
Oh,
it's it,
that's just the beginning.

1156
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.830
That's the most obvious one that everyone knows about.
Um,

1157
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.040
people make fun of Ebonics,
right?

1158
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:18.230
Remember that when he'd gone x was happening and it's just like 15,
20 years ago,

1159
01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:21.790
I was like,
this big joke.
I'm my God,
it's the one they were actually teaching it.

1160
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.660
Well,
yeah,
actually a friend of mine is,
uh,
wrote the book on it.
And,

1161
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.760
um,
well,

1162
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:32.790
so think about how often in a day that you use what used to be called black

1163
01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:35.910
slang.
Right?
We all do all the time.
Even professors,

1164
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.140
even like fucking Bob Costas uses it now.
Like Bob Costas.
Yeah.

1165
01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:41.590
What did I hear you?
What'd he say?
He said something like,
what did he say?

1166
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.290
It wasn't something like dope,
but it was something like,

1167
01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.040
I forget it was some black slang with her and be like,
God,
see if you,

1168
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:52.110
if Bob Costas is,
is saying this then,
but no,
it's there.
Cool.
We've done no,

1169
01:06:52.111 --> 01:06:55.210
no,
no.
It was better than that.
Uh,
but yeah.
Cool.

1170
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:59.290
Is One bad bad is another one?
Yeah.
Oh,
but no,
we've,

1171
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.090
there's quantitative studies on this.

1172
01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:06.091
So the number of words that come from black vernacular is immense in American

1173
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:11.080
English.
Immense,
I'm sure.
And so much of it is now perfectly respectable.
Right.

1174
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.240
Um,
all of that when it,
but when those words were invented,
fuck,

1175
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.690
that was like stupid nigger say that,
right?
I mean,
right.
You know,

1176
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.080
and now it's like,
ah,
that's,
that's great.
Um,
yeah.

1177
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:27.190
So from the beginning I called them America's original renegades from the

1178
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:32.050
beginning.
Black working class culture has been the main,
not the only,

1179
01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:36.850
but the main counterpoint to this puritanism it's been with us ever since.

1180
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.560
That's absolutely fascinating.

1181
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:43.890
It's a very interesting scenario to picture what America would have been like

1182
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:49.600
had there been no slaves.
Had the African American culture,
not sort of,
you know,

1183
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:54.130
it would be Sweden.
I mean safe,
pretty safe.

1184
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.590
I mean something like that.
Yeah.
Like Switzerland.
Yeah.
Something like that.

1185
01:07:56.591 --> 01:08:01.420
So I'm very homogenous.
Very,
very re,
uh,
restrained,
you know,
I mean,

1186
01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:04.180
hey,
the streets are clean though,
right?
You know,

1187
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.800
but so it's order over spontaneity and it's,
um,
and it,

1188
01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:12.310
it sold,
it totally changes what America is.
Oh yeah.

1189
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:15.800
Cause America we like to think of is the hub innovation,

1190
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:20.210
the hub of artistic expression and creativity and entertainment.

1191
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.950
90% of the great entertainment that the world has ever created comes from right

1192
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:28.750
here.
Take black people out of American entertainment.
My God,
my God,

1193
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:33.440
what are you left with?
Yeah.
Where the fuck would,
where would,
right.
I mean,

1194
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:34.940
think about led Zeppelin,
I mean,

1195
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:39.941
it's been shown now that led Zeppelin pretty much plagiarized a giant chunk of

1196
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:43.910
all of their music from old blues songs.
Yep.
Yeah.

1197
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.160
The stones or the coolest about that.

1198
01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:47.900
Cause they were like from the beginning and they were like,
nope,

1199
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.420
we're playing black music.
That's what we're doing.
We're playing the blues.

1200
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:54.950
That's who our influences are.
That's what we're about.
Yeah.
Wild horses.
I mean,

1201
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:57.700
come on it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
yeah,

1202
01:08:57.730 --> 01:09:00.770
just watching Keith Richardson on a felon and he was saying that he was talking

1203
01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:05.510
about,
oh,
Chuck Berry,
he was like,
yeah,
I am nothing without Chuck Berry.
Yeah.
So,

1204
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:10.240
well,
the Beatles and Chuck Berry had a close relationship to that.
Absolutely.

1205
01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.880
There's so many of those early guys.
Little Richard,

1206
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:15.990
another beautiful example.
Sure.

1207
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:21.300
So many of those early performers that directly influenced the course of rock

1208
01:09:21.501 --> 01:09:26.360
and roll.
Absolutely.
It's a black music.
Wow.
That is a fascinating point.

1209
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:29.180
So if you look at it,
so here's the lineage,
right?
I mean,
you know this,

1210
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:34.040
but just to quick primmer review,
I mean,
it's,
so it's,
it's slave music,

1211
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.500
right.
Which has been called various things.
There were spiritual,
but they're all,

1212
01:09:36.501 --> 01:09:40.060
it's also dance music that they invented a,
then there's ragtime,

1213
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:43.100
late 19th century,
which everyone agrees gave,

1214
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:48.060
gives birth to jazz and blues.
And then after World War II it's,

1215
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.740
it's a rock and roll.
And then rhythm and blue,

1216
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.560
a couple what's called rhythm and blues and soul.

1217
01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:57.620
In the 1960s she gave birth to disco in the 1970s which gave birth to hip hop,

1218
01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:02.390
so and all of that and goes straight back to the slaves on the plantations.

1219
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:06.500
And this culture that I was talking about,
they was outside of this crazy,

1220
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:10.280
repressive white culture.
So it's this fucking white people.

1221
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:14.390
So it's this crazy.
We got to get rid of him,
man.
That's what I'm saying.

1222
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.940
Malcolm X had a point.
Everybody's got a no,

1223
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.210
I don't want to get rid of white people that I want to get rid of whiteness.

1224
01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.930
Seriously.
We need spray tans.
So that's what you're saying.
No,
no,
no.

1225
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:30.140
It looks ugly.
It's orange.
Orange is not good.
Yeah.

1226
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:34.130
Colored.
They don't mean orange.
Exactly.

1227
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.430
Not on this planet.
This planet not Bluey.
Oh,
but Jews,
man,
Lenny Bruce,

1228
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:44.390
right?
So I have four sections in the book on this and so on.
Immigrant groups.

1229
01:10:44.391 --> 01:10:47.660
And I look at,
I look at,
uh,
Irish immigrants,

1230
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:49.730
Italian immigrants in Jewish immigrants.

1231
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.160
And one of the things that blows people away,
they don't know this.

1232
01:10:52.161 --> 01:10:55.520
Most people don't know this.
When all three of those groups first got here.

1233
01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:58.730
So the Irish was early 19th century.
Italians and Jews was late 19th,

1234
01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:01.580
early 20th century.
When they came here in large numbers for the first time,

1235
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:06.290
they were not considered white.
So people who looked just like me,
white as hell,

1236
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.590
we're calm.
And,
and not only just not white,
they were considered,

1237
01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:13.950
the Irish were considered the negroes.
They were considered to be black.
Um,

1238
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.810
because yeah,

1239
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.590
because they came with this culture that was nowhere near White Anglo Saxon

1240
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:21.240
Protestant culture that we've been talking about.

1241
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.930
So the Irish were known as the greatest dancers on earth,

1242
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.860
even better than blacks.
They invented tap dancing with blacks in New York City.

1243
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:33.690
Um,
they could give a fuck about working except how much,
you know,

1244
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:35.010
got them in terms of wages,

1245
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.780
they believed in drinking a beginning at 8:00 AM and continuing all the way

1246
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:44.040
through the day during work.
Um,
they lived,

1247
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:48.240
when they got here,
they lived with and around blacks because they were poor.

1248
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:50.970
So in the city in New York and Philadelphia,
Boston,

1249
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.060
they lived in black neighborhoods and often you see a lot of cohabitation and

1250
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:57.840
you see a lot of what's called miscegenation blacks and whites having sex

1251
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:01.650
together,
procreating Lotta.
Yeah.
So they would call it,

1252
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.610
they were called white niggers.

1253
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:06.330
It was very common and a lot of discrimination against them because of that.

1254
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.110
And also there's very little evidence of racism among Irish Americans during

1255
01:12:10.111 --> 01:12:12.390
that period,
which is weird now because if you think about it,
I mean,

1256
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:15.720
Irish Americans for the last hundred or so years have kind of been unfortunately

1257
01:12:15.721 --> 01:12:18.990
the leaders in many ways of,
of white American racism.
But,

1258
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.940
but then there's very little evidence of it.

1259
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.000
And then what happened was they were like,
wait,

1260
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:28.590
we'd like to get the vote.
I mean they were getting the vote,
but not in mass.

1261
01:12:28.591 --> 01:12:31.770
We'd like to get political power.
We'd like to be treated.

1262
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:35.070
We don't have to get good jobs,
be treated like these white Americans.

1263
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:38.610
So there was this very deliberate conscious effort by Irish American immigrant

1264
01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:42.660
group leaders and church leaders to do several things.

1265
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:45.120
One of them was to distance themselves from blacks.

1266
01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:49.530
So they moved out of the neighborhoods to enter the army and serve in the

1267
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:52.980
Mexican American war and the civil war to prove that they were good white

1268
01:12:52.981 --> 01:12:57.780
American civilians and soldiers.
Um,
they entered politics.

1269
01:12:57.781 --> 01:13:00.360
They became Democratic Party politicians,
again,

1270
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.390
proving that they were committed to the country.
And most of all,

1271
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.190
everyone knows this.
They became cops.

1272
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.760
So Irish Americans moved into the police forces in huge numbers,

1273
01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:11.520
especially in New York and Philadelphia during this period and fire and fire

1274
01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.310
departments.
And it became a racists.

1275
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:18.420
So there were these big anti black,
there were these big anti-black,

1276
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:22.980
a riots called the New York City draft riots in 1863 which was just this huge

1277
01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:26.310
pogrom lynching,
mass lynching of blacks in the streets of New York City.

1278
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:30.870
And that was mostly Irish people doing that.
Um,
and what year was that?

1279
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:35.980
1863 during the civil war.
Yeah.
So it was mass lynchings of black people.

1280
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:40.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
The New York City draft riots.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
It was ugly.

1281
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:45.150
It was in part resentment against rich people who were paying off others to go

1282
01:13:45.151 --> 01:13:48.540
to war for them.
You could do that.
You could sell your draft,

1283
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:52.650
you could sell your selection into the army or you could buy it.
I mean,

1284
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:53.701
I'm so you,
yeah.

1285
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:56.490
You could pay someone to go to war and in your place is what I'm trying to say.

1286
01:13:57.330 --> 01:13:58.800
Um,
so it was a resentment against that,

1287
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:02.970
but it actually sort of very quickly turned toward blacks because it was a good

1288
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.540
wide belief that the war was for on behalf of blacks.
Right.
To free them.

1289
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:11.680
So the Irish were kind of pissed off at the rich people who were,
you know,
uh,

1290
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.660
not going to war when they should have been.
And it was,

1291
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:17.680
but then it very quickly turned to an anti black mass lynching cause they were

1292
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:21.580
blaming these guys for this war that a lot of these Irish guys were volunteering

1293
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:25.630
to go fight in.
Um,
so,
but anyway,
so they,

1294
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:30.010
so if you look at social scientists in the early 19th century,

1295
01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:34.150
when the Irish are coming in big numbers,
they're like,
they're negroid,

1296
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.310
they're really from Africa or their chimpanzees.

1297
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:39.520
There's a lot of theory among social scientists and so called scientists that

1298
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:43.920
the Irish were actually apes.
Seriously.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1299
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:47.820
Books were written many,
many books.
It was common,
commonly believed by,

1300
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:52.180
by the British and by Americans that the Irish were actually apes or the missing

1301
01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:55.210
link between apes and human beings.
That they were actually,
yes,

1302
01:14:55.211 --> 01:15:00.211
it was commonly believed that they were actually get this below African

1303
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:04.420
Americans.
That they were actually genetically inferior to everybody.

1304
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.820
That the Irish were the bottom of the hill.
Very bad.

1305
01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:10.150
They weren't even human beings to many.
What about native Americans?

1306
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.990
And I guess they were down there too,
but yeah,
the Irish.
Yeah,

1307
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.840
I suppose they were sort of similar to the,
to the natives.
I mean,

1308
01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:21.600
there weren't compared to often to them,
but,
um,
chimpanzees,
yeah.
So that's,

1309
01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:22.900
that's in my book.
Yeah,
that's what they're called.

1310
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.780
They were called the Irish chimpanzees.
Yeah.
Uh,
wow.

1311
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:29.140
And I'm talking about like Harvard professors.
Why?
Oh yeah,
no,
this was,

1312
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:32.410
this was respectable academic discourse.
This was like what in respectable,

1313
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:36.310
you know,
this is all,
this is the first half of the 19th century.

1314
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:39.520
This is insane.
This is when the Irish are coming here in big numbers.
Right?

1315
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:42.520
So they,
the early 18 hundreds and it was partly covered,

1316
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:46.490
professors were referring to I Irish as apes.
Yep.

1317
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.590
That's fascinating.
Well,
obviously everyone,
humans and eight,
but,
well,
yeah,
no,

1318
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:53.050
but still,
they still are apes is what they saying.
So then,
so,

1319
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:55.750
but then they go through this route that they go through this really aggressive

1320
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.870
process of what's called assimilation.
Right.
They became,

1321
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.950
they try to assimilate into the dominant white culture.
Um,

1322
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.020
and here's this amazing thing.
So by the end of the 19th century,
just as left,

1323
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:10.060
like less than a hundred years.
They're all the social scientists.

1324
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:12.670
They're doing all these taxonomies of the world's races.
Right.

1325
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.330
And they're ranking them and they mail it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
this is,

1326
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:20.080
this is what my people professors were doing then,
man,
it was hilarious.

1327
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:24.250
And so they would rank all of these races and including in Europe,

1328
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:27.160
they had races in Europe.
They divided Europe into three races.

1329
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:30.370
There were the northern Europeans who were the best ones in the middle Europeans

1330
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:31.061
that were okay.

1331
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:33.490
And then there were the southern Europeans who sucked and who should be,

1332
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:34.510
you know,
ditch diggers.

1333
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.520
The Irish were below all of that where the European Jews fit in bottom.

1334
01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:43.150
Absolutely.
Oh yeah,
totally bottom.
Yeah,
they were awesome.
Some of the,

1335
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:47.950
like the vast majority of Nobel prize winners.
I know.
Check it out.
Okay.

1336
01:16:47.951 --> 01:16:50.080
So Jews,
well,
they may finish the Irish thing.
It's just,

1337
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:51.760
then I'll get to the juice because it's totally linked.

1338
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.770
Within less than a hundred years.
The social scientists and all these professors,

1339
01:16:56.771 --> 01:16:58.870
et Cetera,
and political leaders,
um,

1340
01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:03.700
moved the Irish from chimp to Nordic,

1341
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:06.250
which was the top of the chain.

1342
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:11.030
That was the northern European that was called white man par exsalonce.

1343
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:12.771
So they,

1344
01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:17.771
because they were cops and firefighters and politicians and generals and they

1345
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.860
hated blacks and they were living outside of,

1346
01:17:21.861 --> 01:17:25.230
apart from blacks and they gave up dancing.
I mean,
I'm serious.
He gave up.

1347
01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.280
I'm serious.
If you look at,
if you look at priests,

1348
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.230
Irish priests through the 19th century,

1349
01:17:30.231 --> 01:17:32.750
that's one of the things that we're very concerned about was that Irish were

1350
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:37.470
dancing too much.
They invented tap dance.
They invent a tap dance,

1351
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.810
which is,
or dancing shit.
Well,
yeah,
that's different.
No,
that's Irish Irish.

1352
01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.380
That's Irish.
I'm talking about Irish American.
Oh No.

1353
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:46.220
They invented tap the tap dance,
which is so much,

1354
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.190
which is like the base of so much of vernacular dance.
Now

1355
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.710
the Jews.
Um,

1356
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:56.960
there was a prominent social scientist named Arthur Abernathy who wrote a book,

1357
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.930
which was very typical of the time in 1906,
I believe.

1358
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:04.430
The title of which was the Jew is a negro.

1359
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.420
So the same thing was done with the Jews when they got here and they got here a

1360
01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:11.810
little later than the Irish and not in large numbers,
sort of late 19th century.

1361
01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.190
Um,
same thing.
They were known for their musical ability,
right.

1362
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.710
Jews became very famous in jazz,
right.

1363
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.520
They have to sort of cofounded jazz in many ways.
A lot of them are gangsters.

1364
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.910
That's not okay.
Alright.
Meyer land,
it's very,
very,
yeah,
Mario.
Yeah.

1365
01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:29.510
The Jewish mob was as big,
almost as big as the Italian mob when they got here.

1366
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.790
Um,
and you know,
they were very considered to be very sensual of the body,

1367
01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:38.390
you know,
animalistic and check this out.
This is people,

1368
01:18:38.391 --> 01:18:40.490
when I tell my students as I do not believe me,

1369
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:45.110
but it's many historians have written about this.
Jews dominated,

1370
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:50.270
dominated two sports in the first half of the 20th century.
Boxing,

1371
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.510
you know this and basketball,
basketball,

1372
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.460
they totally dominated basketball,
boxing,
the number of world champions,

1373
01:18:58.461 --> 01:19:00.020
many way classes were Jews,

1374
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.970
many dozens of them were top and,
and then,

1375
01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:08.000
and in basketball they totally dominated basketball until the 1950s that seems

1376
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:10.640
to be the boxing thing though,
in fighting,

1377
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:15.440
it seems to be an economic position thing that when people come over and they're

1378
01:19:15.441 --> 01:19:18.230
immigrants and they're the bottom of the economic food chain,

1379
01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:23.231
like right now where you're seeing an influx of Russian champions and a lot of

1380
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.050
Russian,
right?
A lot of former Soviet Union,

1381
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:30.060
I think it's actually cultural new,
I think,
cause it,

1382
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:34.250
not every immigrant group does that.
Right?
So not Allianz,
Irish.
So when they get,

1383
01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:38.630
yeah,
so,
but I think it's,
it's,
it's when,
so hit will,
let me,

1384
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:42.170
so here's the thing.
Here's the funniest thing about Jews and Italians.

1385
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.270
By the way,
we're the same category as Jews in many ways.

1386
01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.130
They dominated a lot of those sports to what was said about Jews and sports in

1387
01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:51.630
particular,
boxing and basketball was the,

1388
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:55.790
they were naturally gifted athletes,
Jews.

1389
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.470
So the way that,

1390
01:19:57.530 --> 01:20:02.530
the way that people talked about Jews and athleticism then is exactly the way

1391
01:20:03.081 --> 01:20:07.860
that people talk about blacks and athleticism now.
Wow.
That's hilarious.

1392
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:10.320
To what?
To look at.
Sports writers in the 1920s,

1393
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:12.690
thirties and forties talk about Jewish basketball players and how they're

1394
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:16.090
naturally gifted and they can jump higher and they're faster and they're tricky.

1395
01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.940
<v 3>Gear and audits are higher.
All right.
Uh,
yeah,</v>

1396
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:24.040
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right,
right.
Exactly.
Blood higher.

1397
01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:27.760
But because they were trained on the plantation or something to,
well,

1398
01:20:27.761 --> 01:20:31.500
he was genetic as she was about genetic selection selection.

1399
01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:36.010
The biggest slaves to mate with the,
is that true?
Does that factual mean?

1400
01:20:36.011 --> 01:20:40.750
That's a common stated.
Most of the,
sorry,
most historians reject that.
Really.

1401
01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.490
There may have been a tiny bit,
but no,

1402
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:46.030
I would think that that's something you would want to do if you have several

1403
01:20:46.031 --> 01:20:50.100
generations of slaves.
However,
the big ones to breed with the big ones.
Well,

1404
01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:53.860
so this isn't my book too,
but,
uh,
but many historians have said,
well,

1405
01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:00.310
<v 1>if so to,
if you're,
if you're going to be selectively breeding people,</v>

1406
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:04.030
meaning forcing them to have sex with people when they don't want to or
whatever,

1407
01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.410
right?
Um,
they're not going to work very well for you.
You know,

1408
01:21:08.411 --> 01:21:11.950
they're not going to end.
So it's a very tricky thing being a slave master,
right?

1409
01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.310
Because there's no incentive whatsoever to work.
The only thing,

1410
01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:19.030
the only incentive to work as a slave is to avoid the lash to avoid the whip.

1411
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:23.950
So what slaves did typically was they worked just enough to not get whipped,

1412
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:25.450
right?
And not one bit more.

1413
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:31.350
So if you're doing other things to make them want to work even less,

1414
01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.210
they will.
Right.
And there's not much you can do about it,
right?

1415
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.850
Cause you can't whip a slave to death if you whip a slave to death and you have

1416
01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:40.280
a zero labor,
right?
So there's masters,

1417
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:43.690
we're always trying to strike this delicate balance between,
uh,

1418
01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:48.460
about getting the maximum output from slaves who had zero incentive to work
with,

1419
01:21:48.461 --> 01:21:52.360
with wages,
with a wage economy.
Right?
We all have incentive.
We work like Shit,

1420
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:54.520
you know,
just to get the money right.
But there wasn't,

1421
01:21:54.521 --> 01:21:55.840
there wasn't that under slavery.

1422
01:21:55.841 --> 01:22:00.580
So slave masters actually oddly had this disadvantage in a way.
Um,
but anyway,

1423
01:22:00.581 --> 01:22:01.271
so no,
most,

1424
01:22:01.271 --> 01:22:05.740
most historians have not found much evidence of genetic manipulation like that.

1425
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:07.090
So that of breeding,

1426
01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:08.640
<v 3>why do,</v>

1427
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:12.900
why are African Americans so much larger physically?

1428
01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:16.260
Is it a diet issue?
An African Africans,

1429
01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:20.820
I mean the type of pro athletes that you see today,
like football players,

1430
01:22:21.150 --> 01:22:25.880
320 pound college seniors.
I'm not,
is that really true though?

1431
01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.960
Well,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I know that.
But I mean,
if you look at Paris,

1432
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:34.200
if you look at all of all people of African descent in the world now and took an

1433
01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:36.860
average height and weight of them,
I don't know how,

1434
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:38.820
how would it compare to people of European descent?

1435
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:40.740
I should probably do a study before we start.
I mean,

1436
01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:43.680
if you looked at the Nebraska offensive line,
right?
I mean,
yeah.

1437
01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:47.370
You know what I mean?
Like there's plenty of certainly in America,
right?

1438
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:50.280
So giant white people too.
Giant white people out there.
Yeah,
there's,

1439
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:54.390
but there's like a certain athleticism that's associated with the giant black

1440
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.630
people that's not associated with a giant white people who are more lumbering

1441
01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:01.050
and they ever running backs.
They're never,
so,
yeah.
So you know Malcolm Gladwell,

1442
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.550
the writer,
he's The New Yorker.
Yeah.

1443
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:07.180
So he's argued this and he's a black Canadian and he's actually said in the New

1444
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.490
Yorker,
which was amazing.
And he got an a lot of trouble for it.
He's like,
no.

1445
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.390
Yeah,
actually we are genetically better at,
at,
at,
at sports.
That's why.

1446
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.100
That's why we're faster or it,
oh,

1447
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:19.330
because that's connected to sort of old fashioned scientific racism.

1448
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:20.900
The Jimmy the Greek version.
Right.

1449
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:25.180
But how when you look at all the African American basketball players that are

1450
01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:29.650
elite,
all the African American football players that are elite,

1451
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:32.980
all the African American fighters,
boxers that are elite,

1452
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.330
how much data do you need to say?
I mean,
well,
but again,
it's all,
yeah,

1453
01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:39.581
well yeah,

1454
01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:44.581
I mean cause you could be 65 to 80 and ripped and still suck at basketball.

1455
01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.320
Right.
And so it's hand,

1456
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.800
but the guys that are really good at it all seem to be African American and they

1457
01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:54.770
can do things like show me a white guy that moves like Michael Jordan and I'll

1458
01:23:54.771 --> 01:23:57.640
sit down.
Uh,
there have been some,

1459
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.500
there've been some,
no,
show me a white Karl Malone.
Oh,
definitely.

1460
01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:06.630
It been chroma loans,
white Chromelin.
Oh sure.
Okay.

1461
01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:11.560
There's no one,
there's no any other Lebron,

1462
01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:16.150
but there's never been a white Anderson Silva.
That's true.

1463
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:21.640
That's true.
Yeah.
There's why I just,
there's,
there's certain levels.

1464
01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:25.630
I mean,
George St Pierre was an amazing fighter,
but he was amazing.

1465
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.320
More for his,
his intelligence,

1466
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.400
very athletic for sure,
but not ridiculously fast.

1467
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:36.310
Very physically strong.
But yeah,

1468
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:39.040
he was really good at being unpredictable.

1469
01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:43.600
He was really good at the way he would mix up his techniques.
Right.

1470
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:48.330
Well then,
okay,
so then how do you explain that Jews and Italians dominated the,

1471
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.620
all those sports?
I don't know.
Not long ago.

1472
01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:53.380
Well that's what I'm getting assess could be access to.

1473
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.620
They didn't because Jack Johnson was the great heavyweight champion.

1474
01:24:56.621 --> 01:24:59.110
I mean Jack Johnson was the motherfucker that everybody was scared.
I know.

1475
01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:01.480
But there were more,
there were more at the lower weight classes.

1476
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:03.700
There were more Jewish champions and blacks in the first time.

1477
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:06.880
But there was little or people,
yeah,
well,
but I mean I'm saying,

1478
01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:09.550
but they were when you sit her to be and they were awesome.

1479
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.600
So supposedly naturally gifted athletes.
Well,
I mean there's still,

1480
01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:16.750
there were some great black fighters as well as sandy saddler.

1481
01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:19.900
There was quite a few great black mean Griffith.

1482
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:24.190
There was a lot of great black fighters too.
Sure.
I don't know.
I mean,

1483
01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:27.520
I don't know how much of it is access,
how much of it is,
you know,

1484
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.670
access to good trainers.
Yeah.
So like the,
at one point,

1485
01:25:30.671 --> 01:25:31.930
I think it was in the 1940s,

1486
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:36.810
the something like six or seven out of the top 10 scores and the,

1487
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.110
the professional basketball league at the time were Jewish.
Wow.

1488
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.850
And now I think the NBA has not one,
not one.
Dollf.
Uh,

1489
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.420
Danny Shay's I think was the last Jew that I was aware of who played in the NBA.

1490
01:25:49.421 --> 01:25:53.110
He played about like six or seven years ago.
And boxing too,
I mean,
says no,

1491
01:25:53.111 --> 01:25:55.480
try to find a Jew.
Yeah,
no,
I think there's like one guy,

1492
01:25:55.481 --> 01:25:59.140
I saw one guy like about 10 years ago.
I'm always on the lookout.

1493
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.040
I grew up with one,
Dana Rosenblatt.
He was a new England champion.

1494
01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:07.310
<v 2>Ah,
really dangerous.
Dana Rosenblatt.
Yeah.</v>

1495
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:12.030
Tough fighter in the UFC at,
are there any Jews?
I don't think so.
Um,

1496
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:16.260
there's probably a few I've never noticed.
Yeah,
you'd have to.
Uh,

1497
01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.510
I dunno.
I Dunno.
It's a good question.
I'd have to go,
uh,

1498
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:24.440
go through the archives.
But as far as champions,
no,
no,
definitely no,

1499
01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:29.150
no champions.
Right,
right.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
I mean,
well,

1500
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:30.550
so Russian.
So you were talking about Russians,

1501
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:35.750
are they Russians are naturally genetically superior.

1502
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:38.640
Well flex.
I mean some of them.
That's why they're so good.

1503
01:26:38.641 --> 01:26:40.130
You ever seen provide Nicole?
Yup.

1504
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.670
That guy looks like Max Kellerman the best description of villainy.

1505
01:26:43.690 --> 01:26:47.320
He said they thought out of Caveman,
put boxing gloves on them.

1506
01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.120
The provide Niqab is sort of my,
he actually,

1507
01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:53.150
I think he serves my argument better cause he's not that talented.

1508
01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:57.440
I mean it's just tough.
He's not like he's talented but he's not his,
the relate,

1509
01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:00.260
the reason he's so successful is that he's been,

1510
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.550
he can get punched in the head 500 times and keep going.
It will powers Chin is,

1511
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:07.820
but its chin is endless.
Chin is very good.
But he also has brutal pal.

1512
01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:12.110
But I mean he's,
you don't look at him and say,
wow,
what a naturally gifted boxer.

1513
01:27:12.111 --> 01:27:14.570
Right.
Compared to not like,

1514
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.090
well Lloyd or whoever is very,
very skillful.
He's,

1515
01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:22.820
he's a craftsman.
Yeah.
He's a real professional,
like a real,

1516
01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:26.560
but providing a cough is very slick too.
He's deceptively slick.
Sure.

1517
01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.080
He just fucking hits really hard to,
yeah,
it's a murderous puncher,

1518
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:32.410
but you don't look at him and think,
wow,
he's,
you know,
he's like,

1519
01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:36.740
but that murderous punching ability is something you just don't,
you can't earn.

1520
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:37.640
I agree.

1521
01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.510
There's a thing about punching you either can hit hard or you can't hit hard.

1522
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.990
You could take a guy and teach him till the cows come home.

1523
01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:48.470
Or You could find some guy who was working construction somewhere and he could

1524
01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:51.920
punch a bag and you just go,
Jesus Christ and you know it.
It's like,

1525
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:53.750
it's like throwing a baseball,
right?

1526
01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.550
It's essentially the same mechanics and,
right.
Same thing with baseball.

1527
01:27:58.551 --> 01:28:02.300
You can't really,
it's hard to teach that.
Like,
so you guys just have an arm,

1528
01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:05.840
right?
And some guys just don't.
Right now,

1529
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.380
look at those guys who have those arms in major league baseball told me what

1530
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:14.240
color they are.
It's all white guys.
Not all.
What the fuck man?
Fuse,

1531
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:17.390
there's a difference between boxing power,

1532
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.330
the punching power and throwing balls for some reason,

1533
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:23.270
and I don't know what it is,
but I don't know.

1534
01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.200
I don't know if they're completely correct.
Uh,
connected.
I don't know.

1535
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:31.210
There's something about getting maximum torque.
I mean,
I just feel like it's,

1536
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.380
I feel like it's similar.
I would think so,
but I've,

1537
01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:37.220
well it is in some ways there's a guy named [inaudible] who was a very good

1538
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:41.540
pitcher in Japan and he became a knockout fighter as an MMA fighter and he

1539
01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:45.080
throws punches a lot,
like see throws punches a lot.

1540
01:28:45.081 --> 01:28:48.080
Like the way a guy throws a fastball,
he's always out of balance.

1541
01:28:48.081 --> 01:28:50.900
He throws everything behind the shot.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1542
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:55.710
It's similar mechanics I would say and a lot of ways,
but I think,
uh,

1543
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.350
well,
you know,
boxing,

1544
01:28:57.351 --> 01:29:01.530
I think you can get away with having shorter arms whereas pitchers seems to like

1545
01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:05.890
that's a big factor in it.
The mechanical advantage of dawn's frames.

1546
01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.220
Shorter arms.
Yeah,
but it got maximum.
But no,

1547
01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:11.070
but the thing about Tyson that people don't talking about boxing,
whatever,

1548
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.980
he got maximum leverage with his body,
right?
People miss that.

1549
01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.690
They think he was just this huge dude with giant muscles.

1550
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:18.990
But if you look at the way through a hook,
he got maximum leverage.
That's what,

1551
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.310
that's where the power came from.

1552
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.280
There's lots of guys just as big or bigger who can't punch like that.
Right.

1553
01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:25.680
And also his speed was ridiculous.

1554
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:29.910
He could throw a 10 punch combination in two seconds.
Sure.
Like literally you,

1555
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:33.880
there's,
there's videos of him,
him hitting the bags and you just like,

1556
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.720
that's like a lightweight,
that's 135 pound guy.

1557
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:41.670
Meanwhile he's two 20 and he also had giant legs and that's where a lot of the

1558
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:44.100
power comes from.
Like if you look at Packy,
owls,
legs,

1559
01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:48.450
shoretel has enormous lecture.
But again,
it's the,
it's the mechanics of it.

1560
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.070
You could be just that big and punch like a girl,
but you also could be,

1561
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:55.950
you know what I mean?
The mechanics,
it's not the same with everybody.

1562
01:29:55.951 --> 01:29:57.660
There's guys that are built like Tyson,

1563
01:29:57.661 --> 01:30:00.270
but for whatever reason they just can't generate that kind of power.

1564
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.940
Tim Lincecum the giants' pitcher,
he's a great example,
right?

1565
01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:06.960
He's like a buck 40 or something is he really can fucking throw 90 whatever it

1566
01:30:06.961 --> 01:30:10.140
is.
Miles per hour,
clock 40 I don't know.
He looks like he's very small.

1567
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:12.960
He's very skinny.
Little wire you guy and he,

1568
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:17.130
but they show he like gets this incredible torque and his torso cross his chest.

1569
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:22.260
Well,
proper mechanics are gigantic when it comes to martial arts.

1570
01:30:22.261 --> 01:30:26.280
It's a church thing like technique is sure,
virtually everything,

1571
01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:31.230
but then there's technique amongst gifted athletes,
but yeah,
I guess so.

1572
01:30:31.231 --> 01:30:33.540
Getting that particular leverage and mastering that,

1573
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:37.200
having that mechanics is something that's not really always,

1574
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.100
you can't really teach it as what we're getting at.
Right?
Yeah.

1575
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.320
I agree with bone structure.
Bone structure is the big one.
Geometry,

1576
01:30:43.321 --> 01:30:47.010
body geometry,
George Foreman,
he had canned hams for fifth.

1577
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:49.200
There were the biggest fucking hands ever.

1578
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:52.260
If you saw his hands when he would make a fist,
I have to go walk off.
Fuck.

1579
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:56.040
And that was why George Foreman hit guys on the arms and their arms would go

1580
01:30:56.041 --> 01:31:00.840
numb.
Right.
It just had this weird mechanical advantage.
It's true.
Yeah.

1581
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:04.650
The mechanical advantage of bone size and density and shape.

1582
01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:09.250
The width of the shoulders as well,
directly translates to punching power.

1583
01:31:09.251 --> 01:31:13.200
It's a very strange stuff.
I know.
It mean it's an alchemy.

1584
01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.140
You can't necessarily,
you can't look at a guy and predict it.
Right.

1585
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:19.500
Not only that,
it's genetically variable.
Like I have a friend,

1586
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:21.270
my friend Ian Mccall,

1587
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:25.500
he's a highly ranked a UFC fighter.

1588
01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:29.310
His brother has brutal Powell and he jokes around about it.
He was like,

1589
01:31:29.311 --> 01:31:30.760
my brother got the power.
I don't have any,

1590
01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:33.510
like his brother has this brutal knockout power.

1591
01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:37.710
Apparently his brother doesn't even fight his brother the same size,
like tiny.

1592
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:41.340
I don't know.
Yeah,
I don't know.
But he's just,
that doesn't even matter.

1593
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:44.660
This guy named John Linacre,
who's a fly went tremendous power,

1594
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.540
ridiculous knockout puncher.
Right.
And he's 125 pounds.

1595
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:51.870
He hits way harder than anybody else in the division.

1596
01:31:51.871 --> 01:31:56.340
It's just one of those weird things.
Why does it,
why can he do that?
I don't know.

1597
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.160
I know that's,
yeah.
Anyway,
but he's white.
He's a worker.

1598
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:03.750
He's Brazilian.
Actually.
Linacre is Winokur's.
Brazilla.
Okay,

1599
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:06.760
so he's kind of white.
Yeah,
right.
You know,
the Brazilian,

1600
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:11.320
you can be widened Brazilian.
Oh,
most certainly.
But Brazil is such a melting pot.

1601
01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:15.700
Yeah.
Well they have a,
they have a tripartite racial structure.
When Japanese,

1602
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:20.020
a lot of Japanese influence.
There's a lot of black,
a lot of Portuguese.

1603
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:23.920
Of course.
The language being Portuguese.
Sure.
That's a very unique and amazing.

1604
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.040
It's weird.
You know,
here you're either white or black and that's all there is.

1605
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.390
But there you can be white,
I think.

1606
01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:31.030
I don't know what the other one with the name is for the people who are mixed

1607
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:33.810
race,
but they have a name for it in a category,
which is different.
Yeah.

1608
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:36.400
I don't know that there's black,
there's white.
And then there's something else.

1609
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:40.810
There's a lot going on over there.
There is.
I mean,
that's,
that's where all,

1610
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:45.460
I mean,
the real MMA started.
That's the birth of,
I mean that's,
you know,

1611
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:49.420
you want to talk culture.
That's an incredible cultural melting.
So there you go.

1612
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:51.250
How do you explain that?
Right.
So why is,

1613
01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:55.840
why is Brazil become sort of the capitol of martial arts?
Well,

1614
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.600
um,
it's arguably not the capital,

1615
01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:02.950
but it's certainly where it came from as far as like high level mixed martial

1616
01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.600
arts.
But what's really crazy is it can all be boiled down to one family.

1617
01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:12.820
Grace's,
yeah,
it's,
I mean that's the fucking,
that's the seed of martial arts.

1618
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:16.300
That is the one.
But why is it important family?
The why,

1619
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:20.380
but why did it take off like it did in that,
in that particular country,
right.

1620
01:33:20.381 --> 01:33:22.360
It's sort of hard until it came to America.

1621
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.880
That's what people don't realize present.

1622
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:28.400
Like everybody thought that Jujitsu was gigantic in Brazil.

1623
01:33:28.401 --> 01:33:32.380
Like everybody in America thought the Jujitsu is gigantic in Brazil when it came

1624
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:36.100
over here.
Like all the,
all the Brazilians know Brazilian Jujitsu.
Like no,

1625
01:33:36.101 --> 01:33:40.720
it was this small clan of bad motherfuckers had figured it out.
And yeah,

1626
01:33:40.721 --> 01:33:43.090
they had world championships over there and yes,

1627
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:47.470
the level of Jujitsu is much higher in Brazil than it was anywhere else in the

1628
01:33:47.471 --> 01:33:48.130
world.

1629
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:52.540
But it was still a fairly small group in comparison to what it's become today.

1630
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:57.010
And that happened in 1993 when they came to America and started the ultimate

1631
01:33:57.011 --> 01:34:00.490
fighting championship,
which was started by Brazilian Jiu Jitsu family and one.

1632
01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:05.290
Yeah.
Right.
Well,
hoists.
Gracie dominated it and his brother started it all off.

1633
01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:06.790
If it wasn't for Horian Gracie,

1634
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:09.070
there would've been no ultimate fighting championship.

1635
01:34:09.071 --> 01:34:10.900
If it wasn't for Horry Ann's Father Leo,

1636
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:14.650
there would've been no family of champions that they could show the world this

1637
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.950
incredible new style.
Yeah.
It all came from this one family,

1638
01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:22.180
which is just amazing.
If that guy wasn't alive,
if there was no Elio,
Gracie,

1639
01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:26.350
no Carlos Gracie,
and know my ada,
my ada was the guy who came to Brazil.

1640
01:34:26.351 --> 01:34:29.170
The Japanese guy came and taught them judo and Jujitsu.

1641
01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.420
If it wasn't for those three people,

1642
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.770
there's no ultimate fighting championship and mixed martial arts is setback

1643
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:38.890
fucking a thousand years.
I mean,
who knows?

1644
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:43.690
There's more of evolution in martial arts since 1993 then they had been in the

1645
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:47.200
past thousand years.
Oh yeah,
no doubt.
So that's all from three people.
Yeah.
Well,

1646
01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:50.200
she's crazy.
No,
it's from millions of people,

1647
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.300
but it's three people that started it all off.

1648
01:34:52.301 --> 01:34:57.040
My Ada who teaches Carlos and Carlos and Leo.
Sure.
But like the question is,

1649
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.980
did

1650
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.250
<v 3>that become so popular?
Right?
That's the end,
which I can't answer.</v>

1651
01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.760
Culture is hard that you asked him about the cause of cultures,
right?

1652
01:35:04.761 --> 01:35:09.020
It's very hard to nail down the cause of a culture.
Why do you know?

1653
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:10.460
Why do we believe what we believe?

1654
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:15.350
Why did that particular thing that's sport become this international phenomenon?

1655
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.190
I don't know.
Well,
the,
for martial arts,
for mixed martial arts,

1656
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:23.000
it's pretty simple because everybody wants to know who's the baddest

1657
01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:24.020
motherfucker on the planet.

1658
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.520
We always thought it was a boxer until we saw box or getting taken down and just

1659
01:35:28.521 --> 01:35:32.960
strangled at will and they were so helpless and we saw like James Tony,

1660
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.310
who's this great fighter who's like one of the best boxers,
pound for pound,

1661
01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:41.350
I mean of our generation changed.
Tony's a outstanding boxing Ranko tour,

1662
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.230
takes him down like it's nothing and just dominates him.
Like,
like a joke,
right?

1663
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:47.780
Like you didn't belong in there.
But see,

1664
01:35:47.781 --> 01:35:52.520
that's a cultural question to why do we like to know who the best bad acid,

1665
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:55.670
who the biggest bad ass is?
What the,
what's the most effective martial arts,

1666
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:58.790
right.
Cause that's cultural.
That was,
that was the Chris genetic,

1667
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:02.330
just a male thing.
That was the founding question of the UFC,
right?

1668
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:05.000
What is the best,
most effective martial art?
Yeah.

1669
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:09.140
So answering that was what the UFC is mission was,
right,
right.
In a way.
Right.
So,

1670
01:36:09.141 --> 01:36:11.690
but that,
that kind of begs the question like,
why do we give a shit?

1671
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.910
It's just a male dominator chimpanzee DNA that's still running around inside of

1672
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:18.800
our heads.
Well,
you know,
why do we,

1673
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.890
why do we want to know who has the biggest dick?
Why do we want to know?

1674
01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:25.820
What's the biggest,
all of his do know?
Well,
some of us do.

1675
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:31.310
Pretending you don't care.
Some of us don't need to ask.
Listen,
that's cute

1676
01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:35.900
that,
I mean,
these are questions that are just,

1677
01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:38.660
they're just normal natural human questions,

1678
01:36:38.661 --> 01:36:43.661
especially when you're dealing with primates suddenly think is good enough.

1679
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:49.520
I'm always skeptical when people make claims about clusters.
Well,
no,
it's not.

1680
01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.830
No,
it's a natural determinism.

1681
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.840
Tracing it back to something in nature and I think it's very tricky to do that.

1682
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:57.710
Well,
this is also,

1683
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:02.711
we live in an incredibly war luck society and we are running on the momentum of

1684
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:07.790
many,
many wars and the,
our dominance over these wars,
I mean our,

1685
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.710
our victories,
World War One,
World War II,
not so much Vietnam,
but all this other,

1686
01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.540
the military industrial complex,

1687
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:19.070
which is sort of infiltrated the entire world with military basis.
I mean that,

1688
01:37:19.071 --> 01:37:20.000
that's our DNA.

1689
01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:23.180
It's one of the reasons why Canadians are so much different than us.
Wait,
wait,

1690
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:23.660
wait.

1691
01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:28.660
You think that Americans have gone to war the way we have for some biological

1692
01:37:28.671 --> 01:37:32.780
reason?
No,
no,
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying main Tim of those,

1693
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.630
those conflicts is a part of our culture.
Oh,

1694
01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.070
cultural DNA and the momentum.
Yeah.
Not,
not DNA,

1695
01:37:40.071 --> 01:37:44.480
like as in genetics,
but cultural DNA.
Yeah.
I'm not sure the momentum of it.

1696
01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:49.160
The fact that we're all born in a society that watches,
I mean,

1697
01:37:49.161 --> 01:37:52.370
how many fucking war movies have there been?
She's Christ.

1698
01:37:52.371 --> 01:37:54.340
I mean every time you turned around,

1699
01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:58.170
there's some new about Americans going and kicking ass and war and fighting

1700
01:37:58.171 --> 01:37:59.760
battles and kill the Nazis,

1701
01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.720
and we probably made way more movies about Nazis.

1702
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:06.480
You know about killing Nazis.
I mean,
we're still making it.

1703
01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:10.530
That quote was a Clinton inglorious bastards.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1704
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:14.220
I mean there we still look good Nazi killing movie.
Fuck yeah,

1705
01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:19.110
man knoweth the Afghans.
I just watched the lone survivor,
Marky mark.

1706
01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:22.770
Marky mark.
He's going to be Marky mark forever.
Sorry,

1707
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:26.460
I'm that age and I can't get up when you're that my edge.
You can't get over it.

1708
01:38:26.461 --> 01:38:28.610
I say it too.
I just thought it was funny that you would call the week.

1709
01:38:28.670 --> 01:38:31.020
You have to be it.
You have to be our age,
right?
Yeah.

1710
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:35.490
You're in your forties he's Marky mark.
I'm sorry,
Mister Walberg.
I'm sorry.

1711
01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.510
Very good actor.

1712
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:41.490
Nothing but killing a lot of Arabs in the movies.
Right?
True.

1713
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.040
Yeah.
Yeah.
Interesting.

1714
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:48.180
But the idea being that we have a very war like society.
Absolutely.

1715
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:51.720
I mean the probably arguably the most warlike you look at in terms of like

1716
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:54.870
history.
I would not argue against that.
Yeah.

1717
01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:59.430
It kind of has to be if there's a hundred plus military basis all throughout the

1718
01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:01.410
country,
if you look at the world,
the world around there,

1719
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.800
and if you look at casualties and you know,
um,

1720
01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:08.910
created by American military interventions,
right?

1721
01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:13.260
Beginning with the American revolution,
civil war was a fucking bloodbath.

1722
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:15.750
Spanish American war,
which we all forget about,

1723
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.470
killed tens of thousands of Filipinos,
world war one,
another,
fucking blood death.

1724
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:25.800
What's the,
what's the total number for,
since the 1776.

1725
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:28.980
Awesome question.
And I should have,
I said,
I'm surprised I haven't added it up,

1726
01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:33.100
but,
um,
I more or less than 50 million.
Oh,
did Americans have killed?
Yeah.

1727
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:35.040
Well that's the hard thing to determine.
Well,
first of all,

1728
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:37.800
a lot of these people we don't know about,
right?
Cause like Vietnamese,

1729
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:41.820
we don't know exactly how many people died under those bombs.
Right.
Uh,
the,

1730
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:45.600
you know,
the estimates range from one to 2 million Vietnamese died in that war,

1731
01:39:45.601 --> 01:39:48.750
but we don't know.
I mean,
a lot of them were vaporized.
Um,

1732
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.840
so or just died in the jungle and no one ever found them.
So,

1733
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.410
but it's not a bad,

1734
01:39:54.570 --> 01:39:59.130
I would guess that the u s the United States of America is probably killed more

1735
01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:03.900
people than anyone else.
What about his con?
Oh God,
we crush him.
Really?

1736
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.540
Oh yeah.
Cause first of all he wasn't using modern weaponry,

1737
01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:09.590
but do you know how many people he killed?
No,
but I,
there's no way he's Monday.

1738
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:13.350
Do you think?
I have no idea.
But it just,
just Hiroshima alone.

1739
01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.760
There's no way he killed that many people.

1740
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.740
They believe that [inaudible] has cons.

1741
01:40:16.741 --> 01:40:20.550
Lifetime between the time he was born and the time,
you know,

1742
01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:24.720
his direct lineage died between,
depending on who you ask,

1743
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:29.580
20 and 70 million people,
11% of the population of the world.

1744
01:40:29.581 --> 01:40:32.490
How are they counting that though?
I have no idea.
Yeah.
Not with weapons.

1745
01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:35.250
I mean some of that could have been disease and they just location and

1746
01:40:35.251 --> 01:40:38.160
starvation and killed entire populations of cities.

1747
01:40:38.161 --> 01:40:40.790
They killed a million people wrecked murder and people,

1748
01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:44.840
they had so many bodies stacked up that the is Meehan.

1749
01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:48.690
Shaw had sent this a the scout team to go checkout Gin China.

1750
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:52.950
They had gotten there after the Mongols had already invaded and they getting,

1751
01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.070
they had abandoned

1752
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:58.020
<v 2>their mission because the roads were so covered in dead bodies and decay that</v>

1753
01:40:58.021 --> 01:41:00.100
people were getting sick and dying.

1754
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.160
The roads were filled with mud and the mud was actually the d,

1755
01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:06.760
The decaying bodies and made the roads unstable.

1756
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:11.860
They saw a pile of bones in the distance that they thought was a snow covered

1757
01:41:11.861 --> 01:41:16.040
mountain and as they got closer they realized it was bones.
Yeah.

1758
01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.740
Dan Carlin's hardcore history does a five part on,

1759
01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.260
on the wrath of the cons.
Well,

1760
01:41:22.730 --> 01:41:26.860
so much so that there was a recent study that showed that they did core samples,

1761
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.160
that the carbon footprint of earth changed during his lifetime because he killed

1762
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:34.690
so many people.
I didn't know this.
Okay,
so fine.

1763
01:41:34.691 --> 01:41:37.720
So we're second 11% of the people of pop on the,
on the,

1764
01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:41.140
on the earth where the runners up then.
Okay.
He can,
he can be the champion.

1765
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:44.930
He went,
he's,
he wins in a big way because they were using fucking arrows.
Yeah,

1766
01:41:44.931 --> 01:41:48.700
exactly.
And bodies that they would light on fire and shoot with Caterpillar.

1767
01:41:48.701 --> 01:41:52.420
That's impressive with no nuclear bombs and no tanks.
That's impressive.

1768
01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.370
And know fighter jets be.
Yeah.
But my,
my,

1769
01:41:55.371 --> 01:41:58.570
the reason for bringing that up is I wish you had known more about Genghis Khan

1770
01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:00.250
cause I would have asked,
well how does someone,

1771
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:03.100
how does a culture become that warlord?
Right.

1772
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.340
Cause that was like some complete next level shit.
Yeah.

1773
01:42:06.341 --> 01:42:09.820
But even experts in that field wouldn't be able to answer that.
Right,
right.

1774
01:42:09.821 --> 01:42:12.800
I mean I don't think,
I don't think they can even try and speculate.

1775
01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:15.970
It's too far off for that era.
There's so few records.

1776
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:19.420
It's really difficult to do history.
Right.
I mean we know some stuff,
but it's,

1777
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:22.930
we know so much less than we do about the 20th century.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.

1778
01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:27.150
1220 you know,
what the fuck did they write down exactly.
Right.
Yeah.

1779
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:29.880
They do have the secret history of the Mongol race.
I mean they,

1780
01:42:29.890 --> 01:42:33.550
they wrote their own history,
but you know,
right.

1781
01:42:33.610 --> 01:42:38.290
It's hard history being written by the winners.
That's difficult anyway.
Exactly.

1782
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.190
When the winners actually killed 11% of the population.

1783
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:46.510
Exactly.
Who else is left?
What are they going to say about it?
I wonder.
Hmm.
Well,

1784
01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:49.830
they were saying in Carlin's work,
he was talking about how that's,

1785
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:54.870
there's a great argument about Iraq and Baghdad literally never recovered from

1786
01:42:56.021 --> 01:42:59.470
Kangaskhan invading and the 12 hundreds like that was the,

1787
01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:04.240
the Muslim people,
the Islamic people were at the head,

1788
01:43:04.241 --> 01:43:06.910
the front of the line when it came to science and philosophy.

1789
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:11.620
And it was just a completely different idea of the Islamic culture then we look

1790
01:43:11.621 --> 01:43:16.540
at today.
But kingus Khan,
they sack Baghdad and killed everyone,

1791
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:20.080
killed the entire town.
They were the original double tap missile.

1792
01:43:20.081 --> 01:43:21.670
Not only they would kill the entire town,

1793
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.900
they would go away and then come back several days later and kill anybody who,

1794
01:43:25.901 --> 01:43:29.140
who had been hiding.
I mean,
they were just unbelievably ruthless.

1795
01:43:29.141 --> 01:43:32.950
So was there an ideology driving this?
It's a good question.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1796
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:36.140
I don't know her know about it.
I just know what I've heard him talking to me.

1797
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.270
I'm just a lowly us historian.
We don't,
what's the ideology for what we've done?

1798
01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.890
Ah,
well that's another question.
Yeah.
I mean,
hey,
it's a good question.
So I mean,

1799
01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.840
God,
guts,
glory,
Ram.
Yeah.
Well,
so there's that.
The John Mccain School,
right?

1800
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:52.590
Which is like defend American honor.
It's very masculine

1801
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:57.140
<v 1>and they wronged us.
So we gotta go fucking avenge ourselves.
I mean,</v>

1802
01:43:57.141 --> 01:43:59.750
I do think that's like,
that's kind of like the base of the Republican Party,

1803
01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:02.510
you know?
I think that that's why they want to go abroad.
They don't,

1804
01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:04.150
it's not really even ideological.

1805
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.660
It's Sorta this primal masculine urge to defend one's aren't family and honor.

1806
01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:12.880
Um,
that's,
that's one reason we've gone and killed people.
Um,

1807
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.620
then the other is economic,
right.
Which everyone knows about,
you know,

1808
01:44:15.621 --> 01:44:20.480
the war was for oil,
right.
Or natural resources or,
um,

1809
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:24.590
you know,
strategic advantage against our enemies.
Right.
And then the third,

1810
01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:28.790
which is what I talk a lot about,
is this humanitarian shit,
right?
Which is like,

1811
01:44:28.791 --> 01:44:32.180
we need to go out and save the world and we need to go out and make people be

1812
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:33.200
like us.
Um,

1813
01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:36.230
and I think that drives actually a lot more foreign policy than we give it

1814
01:44:36.231 --> 01:44:40.290
credit for,
especially now,
especially with the Obama administration.

1815
01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:43.400
So if you look at people inside of his administration like Samantha Power and

1816
01:44:43.401 --> 01:44:46.590
Susan Rice and even Obama himself,
and even Joe Biden Day,

1817
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:49.670
they really come from that kind of thinking about,
you know,

1818
01:44:49.671 --> 01:44:53.150
they're like community organizers or people who did go out into the ghettos to

1819
01:44:53.151 --> 01:44:57.680
like uplift these poor people.
Right?
That's right.
That's who they are.
So they've,

1820
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:00.290
and they've said this if you ask them or read them,
but they have to say,

1821
01:45:00.291 --> 01:45:03.770
they said,
we need to go and save the Libyan.
So that means we've got a bomb.

1822
01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:07.040
Libya,
we need to save the Syrian.
So we've got to bomb Syria.

1823
01:45:07.041 --> 01:45:09.470
We got to save and they're big on Africa.

1824
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:14.020
Susan Rice and Samantha power had been calling for in VA basically invading

1825
01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:14.871
Africa for a long,

1826
01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:19.190
long time to stop another Rwanda from happening to stop another genocide from

1827
01:45:19.191 --> 01:45:22.160
happening.
Um,
they,
it's,
it's just very,

1828
01:45:22.161 --> 01:45:26.750
it's this incredible thing that Americans and the British really kind of created

1829
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:29.510
and perfected over the last hundred and 20 or so years.

1830
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:34.400
The British were all about this,
right?
A South Africa.
It was all about,
you know,

1831
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:36.260
it was about taking the goods down there,

1832
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:38.000
the diamonds and the minerals and all that shit.

1833
01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:40.910
But it was also about uplifting the savages and all of Africa.

1834
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.390
So is it having this ulterior motive,
uh,

1835
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.970
like justifies the invasion,
like,
you know,
no.

1836
01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:50.650
See that's the resources there justifies the invasion.
Right?

1837
01:45:50.651 --> 01:45:53.660
Some people think that that they're being dishonest.
I don't,

1838
01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:55.820
I think they're true believers.
Not all of them.
Not all of them,
I think.

1839
01:45:55.821 --> 01:45:58.310
Do you think Obama is a true believer?
Oh yeah.
I think he,

1840
01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:00.350
and if you read his stuff,
a lot of people don't know this,

1841
01:46:00.351 --> 01:46:03.980
but like if you read his an article in 2007 when he was just starting to run for

1842
01:46:03.981 --> 01:46:06.380
President and Foreign Foreign Affairs Journal,
he says,

1843
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.650
American needs to be the world's leader.
And he says with that,

1844
01:46:09.651 --> 01:46:12.980
for that to do that,
we need to increase the military dramatically.

1845
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:16.580
We need to have more marines,
more army soldiers,
the whole nine yards.

1846
01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:18.350
He called for increasing the military budget.

1847
01:46:18.351 --> 01:46:21.410
People don't realize this in 2007 and he said,

1848
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.700
because we need to lead the world.
We need to be everywhere in the world.

1849
01:46:25.701 --> 01:46:27.110
Hillary's the same way.
Well,

1850
01:46:27.111 --> 01:46:31.580
how do you reconcile the differences between what he said when he was running

1851
01:46:31.581 --> 01:46:34.490
for office and what he did when he got into the office?

1852
01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.400
I think he got a lot of pushback.
You know,
I think a lot of people,

1853
01:46:37.401 --> 01:46:41.960
both in Congress and sort of in the public generally have been less and less

1854
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.180
interested in war for a lot of good reasons.

1855
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.580
And one of the interesting things is it's been,
as you said,

1856
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:48.140
it's been left and right.
You know,

1857
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:50.670
it's been people on the left and the right have been less and less interested in

1858
01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:54.300
the war.
So the ef for the first time in decades,
we have Sev,

1859
01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:58.120
many Republican politicians who are basically antiwar,
you know,
and,

1860
01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:02.670
and powerfully and loudly antiwar like raw rand Paul.
Um,

1861
01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:07.030
<v 3>so sort of like out of libertarian and kind of kind of,</v>

1862
01:47:07.031 --> 01:47:09.610
although most libertarians hate his guts cause he's,
he's kind of,

1863
01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:13.750
he's kind of diverge a little wishy.
He's definitely wishy for them.
Yeah.

1864
01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:17.530
Is that because he's like seen what's happened to his dad and I think it's cause

1865
01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:20.170
he's running for president in a real way,
whereas his,
for his dad,

1866
01:47:20.171 --> 01:47:23.440
it was always just a protest.
Right.
He wasn't really going to win ever.

1867
01:47:23.441 --> 01:47:27.360
So he could be pure ideological.
You think he's playing ball a little bit.
Thanks.

1868
01:47:27.361 --> 01:47:29.350
So who knows?
But I see it's a chance.

1869
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:34.930
<v 1>Small one.
I'd say small one.
It's gonna be interesting.
So what's,</v>

1870
01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.190
what's going to be fascinating,
and I hope this happens,

1871
01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:42.730
is that it's rand versus Hillary because on foreign policy and on a lot and on

1872
01:47:42.771 --> 01:47:44.630
drugs,
by the way,
uh,

1873
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:49.490
she's going to be the right winger and he's going to be the left winger.
Sh she,

1874
01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.490
she sucks on the war,
on drugs and on foreign policy.

1875
01:47:52.491 --> 01:47:54.050
He wants to bomb the fuck out of everybody.

1876
01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:57.770
And she's all about incarcerating people for drugs.
Really.
Yeah.
She's,

1877
01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:00.630
but she's certainly never said anything otherwise.
Um,

1878
01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.960
and every time she's at been at,
and she's her voting record,

1879
01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:06.470
if you look at her voting record,
it's all for the war on drugs,
top to bottom.

1880
01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:08.270
And her fucking husband was like a liter of it,

1881
01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:13.430
ran on the other hand is not perfect and foreign policy,

1882
01:48:13.431 --> 01:48:16.190
but he's way less interventionist and she is right.

1883
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:20.990
Much more hesitant to go abroad with the 82nd airborne and he's awesome on

1884
01:48:20.991 --> 01:48:25.040
drugs.
You know,
he's about legalizing weed tomorrow and he's probably

1885
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:29.570
<v 3>even on the powders,
the big fear that everyone has with,
uh,</v>

1886
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:31.400
the idea of a non interventional,

1887
01:48:31.401 --> 01:48:36.401
his foreign policies that some big evil government will build up without,

1888
01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:41.020
without us being there to smack them down some isis type scenario,

1889
01:48:41.021 --> 01:48:43.660
we'll get completely out of control and,
you know,

1890
01:48:43.661 --> 01:48:48.310
start killing Americans abroad and launching attacks.
That's the big fear.

1891
01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.173
Right.

1892
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:50.780
<v 1>Well.
Okay,
so,
you know,</v>

1893
01:48:50.781 --> 01:48:55.190
that's an argument for having a powerful defensive military,
right?

1894
01:48:55.191 --> 01:48:58.190
That's not what we've ever had.
We've never had a defensive military.
Well,

1895
01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:02.690
you would know from studying martial arts at the best defense is a good offense.

1896
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:06.440
You can also,
I've heard the other,
I've heard the flip of that,
right?

1897
01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.850
It's the other way around too.
Right?
Good defense is a good audience of it.
Uh,

1898
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:12.381
well,
I mean,

1899
01:49:12.381 --> 01:49:16.940
the point is that the u s military historically has never been used defensively.

1900
01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:19.880
Really.
It's never,
ever even a World War II.
I mean,

1901
01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:24.680
it's hard to even argue that Pearl Harbor was,
you know,
it was first of all,

1902
01:49:24.681 --> 01:49:27.110
a lot of people have said that the Japanese were forced to attack Pearl Harbor,

1903
01:49:27.111 --> 01:49:30.410
but,
but certainly apart from world war two,
I mean,

1904
01:49:30.411 --> 01:49:33.650
the US military has never been used truly in defense of us.

1905
01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:38.270
And that's what people need to come to grips with.
Um,
so,
you know,

1906
01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:41.630
if you want to talk about changing that pattern,
you know,

1907
01:49:41.631 --> 01:49:46.130
and creating a military and a that is truly defensive,

1908
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.850
um,

1909
01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:51.850
and the culture so that we are interested in our military only as a defensive

1910
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:57.190
mechanism means right then,
then we can have,
we have something to talk about,

1911
01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:00.710
but that's not the way it's ever been used.
Right.

1912
01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:04.900
<v 2>And what would,
what would be the argument for,</v>

1913
01:50:07.190 --> 01:50:07.970
I mean,
is there,

1914
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:12.970
is there an argument for beefing up our presence abroad to prevent peace or

1915
01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:16.400
prevent or to,
to ensure peace rather?
I mean,

1916
01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:20.380
is there an argument for like the Mccain School of thought,
like beefing up our,

1917
01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:24.230
our positions and all these different parts of the world just to make sure that

1918
01:50:24.231 --> 01:50:27.260
like an isis type situation and could never rise up?

1919
01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.350
<v 1>Yeah,
there's definitely an argument.
Um,
it's called Pax Americana,</v>

1920
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:34.100
the American piece.
Um,
a great,
uh,

1921
01:50:34.101 --> 01:50:36.000
example of that argument,
um,

1922
01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:41.170
was a document written by think tank in 2099 or 2000.

1923
01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:45.710
Uh,
you may have heard of this,
um,
project for a new American century.

1924
01:50:46.250 --> 01:50:48.380
Okay.
Was a think tank in Washington DC,

1925
01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.010
which was full of people who ended up in the Bush administration

1926
01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.990
neoconservatives and in that document,
um,

1927
01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:00.540
re it's called rebuilding America's defenses.
You can Google it.
It's online.
Um,

1928
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:04.520
in that document they call for a massive buildup of the u s military.

1929
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:09.790
They called for a massive deployment of troops and bases and aircraft carriers

1930
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:12.740
all across the world.
Um,

1931
01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:18.460
and they said that that is necessary to maintain world order American dominance.

1932
01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.980
And they said peace.

1933
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:25.940
And one of the scariest things about that document is that in it,

1934
01:51:25.941 --> 01:51:30.440
and everyone should look at this and says,
this is in 2000,
it says,

1935
01:51:30.441 --> 01:51:34.520
we can't convince Congress or the American people to go for this program to

1936
01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:38.150
spend way more money on our defense,

1937
01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.160
on our military and s and a step,

1938
01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:43.520
build these bases all over the world and send aircraft carriers everywhere

1939
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.920
unless they said in the document,

1940
01:51:45.921 --> 01:51:50.860
unless there is a precipitating event like Pearl Harbor Harbor.
Yeah.

1941
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:54.680
Um,
now that's always not a truther.

1942
01:51:54.710 --> 01:51:56.720
I don't think they actually did fly the,

1943
01:51:56.721 --> 01:52:00.890
I don't think the Bush administration was responsible for nine 11 but no

1944
01:52:00.891 --> 01:52:02.690
question about it.
It's served their purposes.

1945
01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:03.890
<v 2>Well.
You would know that quote,</v>

1946
01:52:03.891 --> 01:52:08.891
there's a famous quote about any situation that's not capitalized on any tragic

1947
01:52:10.101 --> 01:52:12.770
event that's not capitalized on is truly a tragedy.

1948
01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:16.610
There's some military quote about that.
Never let her.
Well,

1949
01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:20.450
I know that what's been said recently has never let a good crisis go to waste.

1950
01:52:21.050 --> 01:52:23.980
Right.
That's there.
I don't remember what the quote.
Yeah,

1951
01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:26.900
but it's something along those lines.
That's essentially what the idea,

1952
01:52:26.901 --> 01:52:29.450
and that's what I've had a problem with a lot of people that say that,
oh,

1953
01:52:29.451 --> 01:52:32.810
the government planned it.
Look how they capitalized on it,
man.

1954
01:52:32.811 --> 01:52:35.630
Just because somebody capitalize on something doesn't mean they planned it.

1955
01:52:35.631 --> 01:52:39.560
It just,
it's much more likely they saw an opening to pass through.

1956
01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:44.240
Like that's also been the,
the argument about Oklahoma City when Oklahoma City,

1957
01:52:44.241 --> 01:52:44.701
there was a,

1958
01:52:44.701 --> 01:52:49.280
a radical sweep of legislation that went through that couldn't go through

1959
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:52.810
antiterrorism type legislation post Oklahoma City and like,

1960
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.200
well they planned Oklahoma City.

1961
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:58.340
They blew up that building and they blamed it on Timothy Mcveigh in order to

1962
01:52:58.341 --> 01:53:00.970
push this and knows fertilizer bomb.

1963
01:53:00.971 --> 01:53:04.340
I mean he's always compelling arguments about it that are really confusing.
Fuck.

1964
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:07.670
Cause you get trapped down that rabbit hole of,
you know,

1965
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:12.560
those wacky websites,
they don't need a conspiracy.
Right.

1966
01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:18.040
They got what they wanted in nine 11 and in Oklahoma City they got the

1967
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:19.160
justification,

1968
01:53:19.161 --> 01:53:23.780
the rationale for a massive ramping up of the u s military and the state

1969
01:53:23.781 --> 01:53:25.820
surveillance apparatus and the rest of it.

1970
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:29.960
But what's your take on false flag events that have actually happened?
Like what?

1971
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:34.970
Well,
okay,
let's,
how about a planned when it didn't happen?
Northwoods.

1972
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:37.100
What's Northwoods?
I don't even know what that is.

1973
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:39.800
You don't know what operation Northwoods is?
Maybe.
Wow.

1974
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:45.010
Operation Northwoods was a sign by the joint chiefs of staff in 1962 and it was

1975
01:53:45.771 --> 01:53:49.670
a plan to get people enthusiastic about a war with Cuba.

1976
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:51.140
They were going to blow up a drone.

1977
01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:55.000
Jetliner blame it on the Cubans and we're going to arm cumin friendlies.
Okay.

1978
01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:59.930
And Bomb Guantanamo Bay.
And,
uh,
they were going to kill Americans,
civilians,

1979
01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:03.070
and they were going to blame it on Cuba and that,
that was going to get us,

1980
01:54:03.170 --> 01:54:07.820
it was vetoed by,
sure.
Yeah.
This was the Kennedy era,
see Kennedy era era CIA,

1981
01:54:07.821 --> 01:54:11.810
which was one of the crazier iterations of the CIA.
Yeah.

1982
01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.650
So they had a lot of that shit going on.
Then a lot of,

1983
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.990
there was absolutely conspiracy,
straight up closed doors,

1984
01:54:16.991 --> 01:54:20.330
cigar smoke and sub conspiracies in that CIA and another cis too,

1985
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:22.280
that it was kind of the peak of that,
you know,

1986
01:54:22.281 --> 01:54:25.130
blowing up Castro's cigars and all that shit.
Right.
Yeah.

1987
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:29.810
They weren't dynamite and yeah,
it was those dudes.
It's that kind of group right.

1988
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:32.420
Then who were part of that,
so,
oh,
sure.
Larry's idea,

1989
01:54:32.421 --> 01:54:37.320
isn't it a real exploding cigar,
like a fucking geniuses.
Yeah.
If you want.

1990
01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.460
It's a really fun,
I mean,
it's funny now,
thank God they weren't six,
they,

1991
01:54:40.461 --> 01:54:42.980
I've never tried these things,
but they had all kinds of plans like that,

1992
01:54:42.981 --> 01:54:47.960
that were utterly ridiculous to get to basically to get Castro.
Right.
So,

1993
01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:51.480
sure.
I mean,
and I'm sure right as we speak in the Pentagon,
someone's coming up,

1994
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:54.090
coming up with some secret plan to do something bad to somebody,

1995
01:54:54.110 --> 01:54:58.340
but wasn't that an issue with,
um,
when the Bush administration was leaving,

1996
01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.210
they were trying to plan something against Iran.

1997
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.610
There was some sort of a false flag against,

1998
01:55:04.611 --> 01:55:07.160
I ran the Dick Cheney was a accused of being a part of,

1999
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.990
certainly NASA came to fruition,
wouldn't put it past them,
but those,

2000
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:16.460
those things can happen very difficult to organize and pull off.
Absolutely.

2001
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:18.560
And on a scale of like nine 11,

2002
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:21.530
the amount of people that would have to be involved with that,
the point is,

2003
01:55:21.531 --> 01:55:24.350
again,
they don't need it.
You know,
like they got the,
as you were saying,

2004
01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:25.820
they've got their culture behind them,

2005
01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.190
but it's also the idea about something like Isis,

2006
01:55:28.191 --> 01:55:31.880
like why would you call it a false flag when you could just leave a bunch of

2007
01:55:31.881 --> 01:55:35.690
weapons lying around and write a bunch of assholes suit up and get crazy and

2008
01:55:35.691 --> 01:55:38.450
then shoot them down.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
That's,

2009
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:40.280
that's hard to wrap your head around,
isn't it?

2010
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:44.550
That's hard to believe that that's a real,
a real strategy.

2011
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:47.430
<v 1>Yeah,
it's really depressing and scary actually.
I mean,</v>

2012
01:55:47.431 --> 01:55:49.530
if you look in 1984 that's what that is.
That book,

2013
01:55:49.810 --> 01:55:51.000
that book is about endless war.

2014
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:54.570
That's the theme of that book and it's looking more and more like that.
You

2015
01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:57.750
<v 2>as a student and a professor of history,</v>

2016
01:55:57.751 --> 01:55:59.670
as a guy who's really studied it over and over again,

2017
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:04.470
what do you see us solution to this sort of a quagmire?

2018
01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.200
Do you see a potential

2019
01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:10.900
<v 1>rode out of this?
Yeah.
Out Now.
That's mine.
That's,
yeah,</v>

2020
01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.270
tomorrow.
Today.
You know,
I mean,
and that's,

2021
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:17.090
<v 2>and let everybody over there just blow themselves up.
Let them figure it out.</v>

2022
01:56:17.091 --> 01:56:18.260
Isis rise to power.

2023
01:56:18.261 --> 01:56:21.980
They have a fucking hundred billion dollars in nuclear power and

2024
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.030
<v 1>just you just deal with it.
Yeah,
I mean,</v>

2025
01:56:24.031 --> 01:56:27.600
I think every piece of intervention makes it worse for us.
I do.
I think that,

2026
01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:30.990
you know,
until we started bombing isis,
they had no reason to attack us.

2027
01:56:30.991 --> 01:56:32.790
Now they have a good reason to fly planes into her

2028
01:56:32.850 --> 01:56:33.320
<v 2>buildings.</v>

2029
01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.730
It also seems to me that as technology improves and as our ability to kill

2030
01:56:37.731 --> 01:56:40.730
people easier and quickly and quicker improves,

2031
01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:45.380
it gets weirder and weirder when you're willing to engage in war like post

2032
01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.080
Hiroshima,
it became this,

2033
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:53.290
the fact that nuclear power and nuclear arsenals existed and it can be done,

2034
01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:56.450
but it hasn't been done since.

2035
01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:00.050
It's like it's so atrocious and it kills so many civilians and it's so

2036
01:57:00.230 --> 01:57:04.190
nonsurgical that we decide we're not going to do that anymore.

2037
01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.460
But it's always there.
But we're pointing them at the Soviet Union.

2038
01:57:07.461 --> 01:57:10.310
The Soviet Union's point,
him at us,
everyone during your,

2039
01:57:10.311 --> 01:57:12.080
your high school years and my high school years,

2040
01:57:12.081 --> 01:57:15.380
we were terrified of being attacked by Russia and they were going to mutually

2041
01:57:15.381 --> 01:57:18.530
assured self destruction was the only thing keeping all this from happening.

2042
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:20.810
But as technology gets better,
it's,

2043
01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:25.920
it's almost easier for people to cause mass destruction almost easier now than

2044
01:57:26.331 --> 01:57:29.830
ever before.
That's true.
Because even scarier when you're,
you're,

2045
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:34.760
you now you have drones and now you have suitcase nukes and now you have all

2046
01:57:34.761 --> 01:57:39.380
this new technology disbursement of toxins and absolutely.
So here's

2047
01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.940
<v 1>know,
that's a reason not to piss them off.
So that's my out now position.
Right?</v>

2048
01:57:43.941 --> 01:57:46.580
That's what that leads into.
It's like,
let's,
if you kick a dog,

2049
01:57:46.581 --> 01:57:48.110
is it more likely to bite you?
I think so.

2050
01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:52.180
<v 2>The CIA would say,
listen,
we need to keep these motherfuckers right.</v>

2051
01:57:52.181 --> 01:57:55.210
We want to put our hand right on their forehead.
Let him keep swinging.

2052
01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.400
That way if we ever have to pop a cap and them,

2053
01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.000
we'll pull the gun out when I left and

2054
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:02.010
<v 1>yeah.
But all of that shit was created by US policy.</v>

2055
01:58:02.011 --> 01:58:05.310
Osama bin Ladin was trained by the CIA.
Right.
I mean,

2056
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:09.300
dean against the Soviets that he got weapons and training and he was their

2057
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:10.134
buddies.
Right.

2058
01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:15.110
<v 2>They instituted the idea of blowing yourself up.
I mean,</v>

2059
01:58:15.111 --> 01:58:18.890
this holy war thing,
this jihad as a holy war.
It really,

2060
01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:22.240
that wasn't a part of their culture until the,
uh,

2061
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:24.110
the CIA came along and taught them it.

2062
01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:28.000
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
for sure.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
It's,
uh,</v>

2063
01:58:28.690 --> 01:58:31.720
the whole thing,
the whole history of the last 30 or so years in the Middle East.

2064
01:58:31.721 --> 01:58:34.060
That's all,
all the bad stuff is created by US policy,

2065
01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:36.660
but it's so hard for us to step out and go low.

2066
01:58:36.670 --> 01:58:40.300
Just let them figure it out on her.
I understand.
We were like,
nope,
nope,

2067
01:58:40.330 --> 01:58:43.240
we gotta be there.
I'll be there.
Keeping the peace out now,
man.

2068
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:46.430
What would you do about isis if you were the president?
Let her,

2069
01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.760
isn't Russell the people of so,
right.

2070
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:53.790
So there are very substantial armies surrounding isis right now that are not the

2071
01:58:54.941 --> 01:58:58.060
Americans,
right?
Kurds have an army,
Iraq has an army.

2072
01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:01.930
Saudis don't want those dudes around.
And we're a part of this attack on them.

2073
01:59:01.931 --> 01:59:06.100
It's not just the United States attack.
Isis is maybe 20 to 30,000,

2074
01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:09.790
19 to 20 year old dudes with something like that.

2075
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:13.810
I've never seen an estimate more than 30,
30 k.
Um,

2076
01:59:13.930 --> 01:59:17.560
there are a bunch of fucking teenage lunatics,
you know,
basically.
I mean,

2077
01:59:17.561 --> 01:59:18.251
that's the core of them.

2078
01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:21.640
And then in terms of like the hardcore membership people,
the estimates,

2079
01:59:21.641 --> 01:59:23.980
I've seen her more like 10,000.
Um,

2080
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:26.290
what are they going to do against the Kurdish army,

2081
01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:31.030
the Iraqi army and the Saudis?
I don't see it.
Um,
so yeah,

2082
01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:35.110
good luck dudes.
And also on top of that,
as I was saying earlier,

2083
01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:40.480
good luck trying to impose sharia on a whole population that streaming the

2084
01:59:40.481 --> 01:59:44.820
Simpsons through its satellite dishes.
Good luck with that.
But

2085
01:59:45.110 --> 01:59:48.920
<v 2>you see these guys getting their heads cut off on television.</v>

2086
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:53.930
That to me like the,
the big production of taking people,

2087
01:59:53.931 --> 01:59:58.190
especially taking people that don't deserve it.
That's one of the weird ones.

2088
01:59:58.191 --> 02:00:02.030
To me that's like what could be gained at a cutting someone's head.

2089
02:00:02.031 --> 02:00:04.450
I've heard people say terror.
Well yeah,

2090
02:00:04.670 --> 02:00:09.530
I've also heard people say that this is to try to get Americans to not go there

2091
02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:13.800
and then like that is the last thing.
Of course not.
That would work for you.

2092
02:00:13.810 --> 02:00:17.180
Got to kill journalist and cut their heads off and I'm going to demand action

2093
02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:19.430
there.
Obviously baiting us into it.
But why?

2094
02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.240
<v 1>Uh,
well for the reasons we've been talking about.</v>

2095
02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:25.390
They know that if Americans intervene and start bombing people,

2096
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:26.980
they're going to kill some civilians and guests who,

2097
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:30.130
who will be a great recruits recruiting material,

2098
02:00:30.131 --> 02:00:33.250
the families of those civilians killed.
So you think it's a,

2099
02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:36.580
the strategy to create martyrs?
Probably.
We don't know for sure,

2100
02:00:36.581 --> 02:00:39.040
but I put that it would be a smart one.
Yeah,
it makes sense to me.

2101
02:00:39.041 --> 02:00:41.920
What a weird strategy.
Well No,
to get the short

2102
02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:43.910
<v 2>sided.
Is it possible that they're just,</v>

2103
02:00:44.150 --> 02:00:46.190
they're just not thinking that far in advance?

2104
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:47.171
<v 1>No,</v>

2105
02:00:47.171 --> 02:00:51.400
I mean the strategy is to get us to drop bombs on the people of the Middle East.

2106
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:53.620
Right.
Which tends to the blowback theory,

2107
02:00:53.621 --> 02:00:57.070
which tends to cause people to dislike the United States and join groups like

2108
02:00:57.071 --> 02:01:00.430
Isis.
Right.
So it's a great,
David Patraeus himself said it's a great,

2109
02:01:00.431 --> 02:01:01.870
that's actually a great recruiting tool.

2110
02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:05.680
So US foreign policy interventions in the Middle East has served as the greatest

2111
02:01:05.681 --> 02:01:08.920
recruiting tool for al Qaeda and isis.
Of course.
Right.

2112
02:01:08.921 --> 02:01:11.440
You get people to be pissed off.
I want to see what I mean,

2113
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:13.660
what would cause you to join a terrorist group?
I mean,

2114
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:16.210
the only thing that would cause me to do that is if someone dropped a fucking

2115
02:01:16.211 --> 02:01:20.170
bomb on my family.
Right,
right.
You know,
I'd be,

2116
02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:22.420
I'd be not a nice person.
Right.

2117
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:25.990
And I'd be willing to do all kinds of crazy shit I wasn't willing to do prior to

2118
02:01:25.991 --> 02:01:26.824
that.
Right.

2119
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:29.950
What better way than to bait get the United States to start doing that?

2120
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:33.730
Create a whole population of potential recruits.
Wow.

2121
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:36.940
That's a fascinating end game.
They're not,
they're crazy,
but they're not stupid.

2122
02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:40.040
That's terrifying.
It's just,

2123
02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.700
<v 2>it's,
it's terrifying.
When I remember when I was a boy,</v>

2124
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:49.070
I think I was probably seven somewhere around then when the Vietnam war ended

2125
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.860
between seven and 10,
something like that.
I was living in San Francisco,

2126
02:01:51.861 --> 02:01:55.880
so it was between seven and 10.
And um,
the war ended.

2127
02:01:56.210 --> 02:02:00.220
And I remember thinking to myself as a young boy,
oh,

2128
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.660
they're done with war.
Beautiful.
This is good.

2129
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.520
I really remember thinking that like,

2130
02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:08.420
like people figured out that war is terrible and will never go to war again.

2131
02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:12.920
And then when we invaded Iraq after Iraq invaded Kuwait,

2132
02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:16.760
I think I was probably 21 and I remember thinking,

2133
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:20.240
I can't fucking believe were at war again.
Like I thought we were done.

2134
02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:24.320
I thought people had realized that war is ridiculous and we'd never go to war

2135
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:25.154
again.

2136
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:30.250
And that was just the tip of the iceberg in comparison to this insanity that's

2137
02:02:31.281 --> 02:02:36.281
happened post nine 11 the post nine 11 and sanity is just this perpetual war.

2138
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.670
The culture of war.
Every bomb we dropped their perpetuates the war.

2139
02:02:40.730 --> 02:02:41.563
That's my point.

2140
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:46.460
Because it creates more enemies or we just fucked so many people up.

2141
02:02:46.461 --> 02:02:50.390
There's no enemies left.
Right?
Right.
That's one option.
You can kill all of them.

2142
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:53.580
Kill everybody.
Okay.
Kill them all.
Let God sort of matters.

2143
02:02:53.581 --> 02:02:55.010
Isn't that like a marine tee shirt or something?

2144
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:57.590
<v 1>Do that.
Let's do that.
Let's drop many,
many years,</v>

2145
02:02:57.590 --> 02:03:01.360
<v 2>many new nuclear bombs all across the Arabian plane</v>

2146
02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:08.000
and see what happens.
Yeah.
So there's two options.
Kill them all or get out.

2147
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:11.950
Yes.
Or do what we're doing and then show her perpetual war.
Yeah.

2148
02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.280
That's how I see it,
I think.
Yeah.

2149
02:03:13.370 --> 02:03:16.880
Do you buy into the conspiracies like the Eisenhower conspiracy when he was

2150
02:03:16.881 --> 02:03:18.200
leaving,
leaving office,

2151
02:03:18.201 --> 02:03:21.080
when he was saying beware of the military industrial complex,

2152
02:03:21.081 --> 02:03:24.320
there's a machine that wants to go to war.
Do you,
do you buy that?

2153
02:03:24.321 --> 02:03:29.321
They look at this as this perpetual war as a constant profit source?

2154
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:33.150
<v 1>Um,
so defense contractors is what he was talking about.</v>

2155
02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:36.840
And then he was talking about also research universities who were working with

2156
02:03:36.841 --> 02:03:40.110
the defense contractors.
Of course.
Damn,
they love war.
Sure.

2157
02:03:40.111 --> 02:03:45.090
Raytheon once all the wars in the world.
Right.
Um,
allegedly,

2158
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:49.290
no,
definitely.
Um,
but,
um,
are they,
the question is,

2159
02:03:49.291 --> 02:03:52.260
are they really running the show?
Right?
To what,
or to what extent are the,

2160
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:56.040
what extent?
Now we know that if you look at Hillary Clinton's list of donors,

2161
02:03:56.070 --> 02:03:56.650
it's like she,

2162
02:03:56.650 --> 02:03:59.400
she's been called the senator from Lockheed Martin because she gets so many

2163
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.050
donations from him and she's,
is she the only one?
Of course not.
But you know,

2164
02:04:04.051 --> 02:04:05.820
they have other interests.
They have constituents.

2165
02:04:05.850 --> 02:04:07.410
They have all sorts of competing interests.

2166
02:04:07.411 --> 02:04:10.560
I think the defense contracts contractors have some power just like the Israeli

2167
02:04:10.561 --> 02:04:13.020
lobby has some power.
But I actually at the end of the day,

2168
02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:15.960
I think that they're autonomous and I think they have their own motives and I

2169
02:04:15.961 --> 02:04:18.270
think a lot of them are,

2170
02:04:18.271 --> 02:04:21.060
especially with people like Hillary and Obama and others.

2171
02:04:21.090 --> 02:04:25.730
And the neo Kahns under Bush,
um,
had an ideological motivation.
Yeah.

2172
02:04:25.770 --> 02:04:27.060
Which was Pax Americana,

2173
02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.720
which was a world order controlled by us are controlled by them,
I should say.

2174
02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:36.080
<v 2>When you see the difference between the way Obama was like the,</v>

2175
02:04:36.090 --> 02:04:39.150
the hope website,
hope and change,
whatever the fuck it was.

2176
02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:41.330
When they went into,

2177
02:04:41.730 --> 02:04:46.320
they had this whole section on whistle blowers about,
you know,

2178
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:49.650
helping whistle blowers alert,
you know,

2179
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:54.480
the American people to crime and to things that are going on that are

2180
02:04:54.481 --> 02:04:55.320
unconstitutional.

2181
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:59.070
And then it's all been removed from the website and now you see how horrible

2182
02:04:59.071 --> 02:05:04.071
he's been on not just whistle blowers but on the press and on people forcing

2183
02:05:05.311 --> 02:05:09.210
people to divulge their sources.
And the worst.
Yeah.
The of you,
it's called him,

2184
02:05:09.211 --> 02:05:11.880
called him the worst president on the fuck.
Does that happen?

2185
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:15.480
Is that just a guide that's just under pressure once he gets into office?

2186
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:17.790
Or is that how he was all alone?

2187
02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.560
<v 1>I think it's who he was all along.
So he was just bullshit.
You got everyone.</v>

2188
02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:24.610
So in 2007,
2008,
when he's running for president,
I was,

2189
02:05:24.611 --> 02:05:28.400
I felt like I was on an island in a sea of crazy people because I was reading

2190
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:31.370
what he was writing.
I was listening to his speeches.

2191
02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:36.400
I read the Democratic Party's platform for 2008 and in it,

2192
02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:40.580
it was all about the military industrial complex.

2193
02:05:40.581 --> 02:05:44.450
It was all about expanding American power and control abroad.

2194
02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.910
It was about increasing the military budget,

2195
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:49.580
increasing the number of marines and army soldiers.

2196
02:05:50.690 --> 02:05:53.450
It was about not repealing the Patriot Act.

2197
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:58.370
It was about a very powerful state,
nation state.

2198
02:05:58.430 --> 02:06:01.040
They're controlled,
not just people abroad,
but people here.

2199
02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:05.000
Dude is always been about that.
Always.
He's always been,

2200
02:06:05.001 --> 02:06:07.880
he's always been a nationalist first.
Um,

2201
02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:11.810
an American nationalist first and everything else is second.
And so,

2202
02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:12.980
yeah,

2203
02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:15.830
I was sort of listening to these people talk about him being a peace candidate

2204
02:06:15.831 --> 02:06:18.650
and someone who would eliminate the Patriot Act and someone who had,
you know,

2205
02:06:18.651 --> 02:06:23.630
never spy on Americans.
And I'm like,
no,
look at who he was when he was running.

2206
02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:26.240
He was saying this publicly.
It wasn't keeping it secret.
It just,

2207
02:06:26.241 --> 02:06:28.910
people wanted to see something else in him for various reasons

2208
02:06:29.010 --> 02:06:32.820
<v 2>because he's articulate as opposed to Bush because he's well educated because</v>

2209
02:06:32.821 --> 02:06:37.500
he's black.
You said black with me.
You were holding on to black.
I was

2210
02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:41.670
biting,
biting my time there.
Yeah.
Well,
I,
you know,

2211
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:46.150
one of the most disturbing moments of the debates to me was when him and Mccain

2212
02:06:46.151 --> 02:06:47.780
and we're going at it and uh,

2213
02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:52.800
Mccain corrected him about Afghanistan and Mccain,
you know,

2214
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:55.590
we were just talking about like just going into Afghanistan and sending in

2215
02:06:55.591 --> 02:06:58.890
troops and he's like,
hold on.
Do you know what the fuck you're talking about?

2216
02:06:58.891 --> 02:07:01.050
Essentially Mccain was like,
have you been Afghanistan?

2217
02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.580
Do you know what it's like there like that that place is run the same way it was

2218
02:07:05.581 --> 02:07:07.950
run when Alexander the Great was around.
Right.

2219
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:11.160
It's really not that much different.
It's incredibly difficult terrain.

2220
02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:15.810
Really hard to get anywhere.
People can hide anywhere.

2221
02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:20.670
Essentially.
You have one city in the entire country,
you've got Kabul,

2222
02:07:20.850 --> 02:07:22.560
and then you got warlords,

2223
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:26.370
warlords that control small groups of people and they're scattered throughout

2224
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:27.630
the country.
Right.
Good luck.

2225
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:32.180
<v 1>Yeah,
so when John Mccain is taking the piece position in a debate with you,
yeah.</v>

2226
02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:35.410
I didn't tell you something about who you are.
Yeah.
But for me it was like,

2227
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:36.580
now he's a warmonger.

2228
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:39.190
<v 3>He always has been.
Obama.
Yeah.
Always has been.</v>

2229
02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:44.350
It's incredible hope and change,
man.
What are you talking about?

2230
02:07:44.351 --> 02:07:47.890
What happened to hope and change restoring America's leadership 2007 foreign

2231
02:07:47.891 --> 02:07:51.600
affairs article.
Everyone should read it.
Everyone should take it.

2232
02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.840
I'll take you five minutes.
Yeah.

2233
02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:58.620
What do you think about like the wikileaks stuff and the Edward Snowden stuff

2234
02:07:59.021 --> 02:08:00.510
and all this?
This new,

2235
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:05.550
the digital age that we live in is very fascinating to me in that there's just a

2236
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:10.861
certain amount of impossibilities in controlling data when you get to like a

2237
02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:15.460
large organization like the United States military,
no matter how,

2238
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:20.170
how well they put up their firewalls,
no matter how good they guard their data,

2239
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:24.790
you're still dealing with human beings and young human beings by the way.
Yeah,

2240
02:08:24.791 --> 02:08:27.880
it's weird.
Technology can cut either way,
right?
So it's like,

2241
02:08:27.881 --> 02:08:29.020
it's on the one hand,

2242
02:08:29.021 --> 02:08:32.710
it's very difficult for those large institutions to control their information

2243
02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:35.950
now.
Right.
We can get in there like Snowden did and like wikileaks has,

2244
02:08:35.951 --> 02:08:38.590
we can get in there and disperse it and everybody fucking knows what they're up

2245
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:39.424
to.

2246
02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:44.050
So that's kind of good I think for democracy and for freedom and for us and for

2247
02:08:44.051 --> 02:08:48.940
our privacy and power,
etc. Against them.
Um,
but on the other hand,

2248
02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:51.530
they can use it against us and our all the time.
Right?

2249
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:54.610
They have all these cameras everywhere and all these city,
you know,

2250
02:08:54.611 --> 02:08:55.760
New York City in London,
I think,
Len,

2251
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:57.570
isn't there a camera on every corner in London?

2252
02:08:57.590 --> 02:09:01.030
How about Camden New Jersey where they don't even have coffee.
Exactly.

2253
02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:05.410
It just placed the comps with cameras.
Right,
exactly.
So,
yeah.
And you know,

2254
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:10.300
um,
so they're looking at us and the FBI apparently has this thing where they're

2255
02:09:10.301 --> 02:09:14.350
looking at us through our webcams,
um,
on our computers.
Got Tape on mine,

2256
02:09:14.351 --> 02:09:17.710
but right.
Yeah.
Good,
good move.
I shouldn't watch a middle aged man beat off.

2257
02:09:17.711 --> 02:09:22.660
You're on your own.
Get it from me.
They might even want that information.

2258
02:09:22.690 --> 02:09:27.490
Let's go ahead.
Beat off the normal stuff.
When I asked me,
I'll show you,

2259
02:09:27.491 --> 02:09:31.480
I'll send you the links.
But,
but I'm not a,
you know,

2260
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:33.880
I'm not hiding anything.
If I was like,

2261
02:09:33.881 --> 02:09:37.670
say if I was a person in a position of influence and I was,
you know,

2262
02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:42.130
concerned about my future and my position in the company and they found out that

2263
02:09:42.131 --> 02:09:45.610
I was only watching tranny porn.
Exactly.
Sorry,
I said tranny.
You know,

2264
02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:48.520
unless they train anymore.
Yeah.
Right.
Transgender porn.

2265
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:52.600
Dan Savage of all people got into trouble for using the word tranny and that

2266
02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:55.450
hilarity believe that shit.
Well.
How about the guy who runs bravo?

2267
02:09:55.451 --> 02:10:00.310
What is his name?
Um,
Cohen.
Andy Cohen.
He got in trouble for saying twink.
Oh,

2268
02:10:00.311 --> 02:10:00.821
I didn't know that.

2269
02:10:00.821 --> 02:10:04.870
Calling someone a perfect twink like you can't say 20 there's people out there

2270
02:10:04.871 --> 02:10:07.570
that are just fucking professional victims,
you know?

2271
02:10:07.571 --> 02:10:11.950
And that's what full circle brings us back to what we were talking about when it

2272
02:10:11.951 --> 02:10:15.130
came to colleges.
And that's one reason why I want to play dear woman for you.

2273
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.490
Do you have it?
You just pull it up.
You have to see this cause it's this,

2274
02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:23.710
this is the white knight and capsulated.

2275
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:28.570
This is the White Knight ideology and capsulated in the most ridiculous form

2276
02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.530
blood pressures about to go up.
No,
it's,
you're going to love it.
Okay.

2277
02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:34.280
It's beautiful.
We stand before

2278
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.020
<v 4>you today as men committed to becoming more conscious in every way we feel.</v>

2279
02:10:39.021 --> 02:10:41.300
Deep love,
great respect,

2280
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:44.540
and a growing sense of worship for the gifts of the feminine.

2281
02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:50.060
We also feel deep sorrow about the destructive actions of the unconscious

2282
02:10:50.061 --> 02:10:52.040
masculine in the past and present.

2283
02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:55.970
We want to apologize and make amends for those actions today.

2284
02:10:56.270 --> 02:11:00.770
So that we can move forward together into a new era of cocreation is this

2285
02:11:00.771 --> 02:11:02.720
beautiful will come more conscious,

2286
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:08.300
conscious play of masculine and feminine energy in me.

2287
02:11:09.610 --> 02:11:10.443
Isn't it beautiful?

2288
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:16.190
I know that we all have access to the full spectrum of these energies

2289
02:11:18.490 --> 02:11:22.010
and awareness of the dementia beyond all humanities,

2290
02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:27.170
freeing Skype like the sky.

2291
02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:28.360
I commit to owning your,

2292
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:32.180
discarding a masculinity that honors and celebrates us as equals.

2293
02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.410
I know truly honor you as a multidimensional woman,

2294
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.490
I must stand fully present with myself and own the gifts I have to share with

2295
02:11:40.491 --> 02:11:43.880
you.
We can create great miracles together.
Oh my God,

2296
02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:46.220
my nurturing each other in a conscious way,

2297
02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:51.710
striking each other with reverence and respect and by worshiping at affinity

2298
02:11:51.711 --> 02:11:54.470
expressed in the masculine and feminine energies.

2299
02:11:55.100 --> 02:12:00.100
What has made our relationship to the feminine has often been unconscious.

2300
02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:05.620
I feel sorrow that women and feminine energy for so long been subjugated and

2301
02:12:06.321 --> 02:12:10.790
oppressed throughout history.
Men had raped and abused goes on for eight minutes.

2302
02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.940
<v 2>Yeah,
we can stop at any moment that,
oh look did playing a theatrical version of,</v>

2303
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:18.570
of pain,
of suffering on the steak.

2304
02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:21.430
<v 4>Bard year from religious and political.</v>

2305
02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:24.660
<v 2>Okay,
stop right here.
You know what it reminds me of a little bit,
you know,</v>

2306
02:12:24.661 --> 02:12:29.460
purity balls,
you know,
or like girls,
the daughters bracelets.

2307
02:12:29.461 --> 02:12:30.294
They had a period,

2308
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:35.890
just the dad just like embracing his daughter and then pledging purity.

2309
02:12:36.431 --> 02:12:39.540
It's something,
there's like a vibe vibe there that reminds me of that.

2310
02:12:39.541 --> 02:12:44.541
And then will Farrell did a funny or die a parody of it that this guy fucking,

2311
02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:48.660
that guy reacted to it in a very negative way.
It was kind of funny.

2312
02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:53.070
Oh was he aggressive and violent and he was upset,
upset.
He was angry.

2313
02:12:53.071 --> 02:12:56.670
That's a masculine trees.
He was saying,
who are these Weirdos?
I didn't even,

2314
02:12:56.671 --> 02:12:58.680
I've never heard of this goes,
they're just losers.
Okay.

2315
02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:01.560
The guys that chicks don't want to fuck.
So they come up with new strategies.

2316
02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.740
This is what I've always said,
and this isn't very unfortunate,

2317
02:13:04.741 --> 02:13:07.260
but it is reality when it comes to men.

2318
02:13:07.590 --> 02:13:12.590
Men Are Slimy Fox who are making sperm 24 hours a day and we want to have sex.

2319
02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:15.600
And here's the deal.
If we're heterosexual and ladies,

2320
02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.330
if you see a guy and you don't want to fuck them,

2321
02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:20.880
don't trust him because if you don't want to fuck them,

2322
02:13:20.881 --> 02:13:23.400
chances are a bunch of other girls don't want to fuck them either.

2323
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.070
And so he has developed tricks in order to stay in the game.

2324
02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:29.580
And one of the best tricks,
it's a separate himself from the pack by saying,

2325
02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:30.690
dear woman,

2326
02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:36.150
I recognize that duality fucking dork.
I know what you're doing.

2327
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:39.340
I want to take that guy hunting.
I want to put him on a fucking gift.

2328
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:42.180
We give them a rifle and make them hike up to the top of the hill and find your

2329
02:13:42.181 --> 02:13:46.290
own food.
He's lacking in all masculine,

2330
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:50.790
positive traits.
These fucking cowering.

2331
02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:52.170
I'd rather see a woman,

2332
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:55.680
I want to take them to a single's bar is the only way to see how he does.

2333
02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.140
Any woman who's not out of her fucking mind,

2334
02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:00.840
but that's the question I a heartbeat.
How successful is that?

2335
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.620
Completely unsuccessful.
Doesn't work at all.
How many views did it get?
Oh,

2336
02:14:04.621 --> 02:14:07.180
probably a million.
But everyone is mocking it just for fun yet,
right?
Yeah.

2337
02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.200
Everyone feels like,
what the fuck?
I probably seen it 100,000 myself.

2338
02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:14.730
Fucking preposterous.
He's a goofball.
But the business,

2339
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:17.910
there's a lot of those goofballs out there that are separating themselves from

2340
02:14:17.911 --> 02:14:18.570
the herd.

2341
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:23.010
They see a group of people that are reacting to the Douche bags of the world and

2342
02:14:23.011 --> 02:14:24.480
there are asshole men,

2343
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:29.130
frat boys and fuck heads and Bros are ruining everything for everybody else and

2344
02:14:29.131 --> 02:14:32.400
aggressive shit heads.
And then they see this and they say,

2345
02:14:32.401 --> 02:14:36.450
I am going to separate myself from that and I'm going to be the guy only it's

2346
02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:39.650
fucking vegetable matter.
And I,
you know,
I,
I,

2347
02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.720
I don't even use mass produced deodorant and I brought some ever watch porn.

2348
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:47.273
Never.

2349
02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.960
There's a great video on that as well that I watched this guy gave a ted talk

2350
02:14:51.961 --> 02:14:56.660
about what's wrong with porn?
I think I know who the Spanish accent.

2351
02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.780
Oh No,
there's a guy who teaches at Texas tech.
Ut Austin does this.
Yeah.

2352
02:15:00.781 --> 02:15:02.100
He's kind of the Robert Jensen.

2353
02:15:02.101 --> 02:15:05.520
He's the leader of this movement against men's movement against pornography.

2354
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:09.660
Right.
Well what about men doing pornography with men?

2355
02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:13.560
There's a problem with the anti pornographic movement is what you were talking

2356
02:15:13.561 --> 02:15:16.950
about earlier is that the idea is that sex is bad.

2357
02:15:17.410 --> 02:15:21.960
Sex is not bad and no one is trying to stop gay porn.
Oh,
here's the thing.

2358
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.770
Unless you're,

2359
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:25.560
unless you're some sort of a fucking church goer and you think that

2360
02:15:25.561 --> 02:15:29.670
homosexuality is evil,
there's no movement to stop gay guys for making gay porn.

2361
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.260
You know,
men are out there going,

2362
02:15:31.261 --> 02:15:35.340
we need to stop these gay men from abusing each other in gay porn.
No,

2363
02:15:35.341 --> 02:15:37.950
they like fucking each other.
They do it for fun.

2364
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:40.830
They enjoy the shit out of it and guys like Dan savage,

2365
02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:43.170
he'll openly talk about how he,

2366
02:15:43.171 --> 02:15:46.260
I mean he was on the podcast just going off about how he watched his gay porn,

2367
02:15:46.261 --> 02:15:49.320
sir.
No,
no one has a problem with it.
Zero people have a problem with it.

2368
02:15:49.530 --> 02:15:54.450
Pornography is the most democratic institution in our society.
How's that work?

2369
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:58.320
There is no desire that is not catered to in pornography.

2370
02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:03.500
There is no body image that is not sold as an object of desire in pornography.

2371
02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:06.630
Little Dicks.
There's no little Dick Porn.
All right,
there's one.
Okay,
fine.

2372
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.850
No,
but if you think about people that I've heard pornographers say it is,

2373
02:16:11.851 --> 02:16:15.210
you know what,
what is your,
what is the thing you hate about your body the most?

2374
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:19.350
Right?
You will find people paying for that in pornography.

2375
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:23.090
It's approach to look at that.
Yeah.
Well that's the thing about having the,

2376
02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.500
the reach that you have with the Internet.

2377
02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:28.890
It's like you'll find a group of people out there and that's one of the weird

2378
02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:31.270
things about any like,
really,

2379
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:37.950
really crazy ideology is that you'll find a bunch of people that agree with you

2380
02:16:38.021 --> 02:16:43.021
on your adoption of Sharia law and then they'll gravitate to you like a magnet.

2381
02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:44.440
You know,

2382
02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:49.360
Sam Harris turned me onto this video with a terrifying video of these guys and I

2383
02:16:49.361 --> 02:16:54.190
believe they were in Norway or one of those countries.
It's like really open to,

2384
02:16:54.210 --> 02:16:56.410
uh,
various religions coming there.

2385
02:16:56.410 --> 02:17:00.070
And there's these guys that are doing this Muslim,
uh,

2386
02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.030
they're doing the speech and they're talking about the idea of radical Muslim.

2387
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:08.650
They're laughing at people calling things radical Muslims.
And He,
in the video,

2388
02:17:08.651 --> 02:17:09.400
he starts saying,

2389
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.400
how many of you agree with what it says in the Koran about about the way

2390
02:17:14.501 --> 02:17:15.790
homosexual should be treated.

2391
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:19.750
Everybody raises their hand that homosexuals should be stoned and that whatever

2392
02:17:19.751 --> 02:17:21.600
it says by whatever God's law is,

2393
02:17:21.601 --> 02:17:23.620
would be the very best way to handle a situation.

2394
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:25.750
And they all raised their hand and he's like,
this is he,

2395
02:17:25.930 --> 02:17:29.020
are you radical and not radical?
You are just Muslims.

2396
02:17:29.021 --> 02:17:31.480
And he's like laughing at it thinking that.

2397
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:33.730
I mean the way Harris described it to me,
he's like,

2398
02:17:33.731 --> 02:17:38.731
this guy is saying something that he says he has so much confidence in it.

2399
02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.210
He's like saying it almost like you would say the best way to stop tooth decays

2400
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:46.810
brushing your teeth like something everybody knows.
And he's saying it like that.

2401
02:17:46.811 --> 02:17:50.500
Confident.
But he's talking about stoning homosexuals.
He's taught,
you know,

2402
02:17:50.501 --> 02:17:54.220
I mean,
it's incredible.
He's talking about women being able to vote.

2403
02:17:54.430 --> 02:17:58.000
He's talking about women,
you know,
having second class citizenship status.

2404
02:17:58.210 --> 02:18:01.960
This is just how it is in the,
in the Koran.
And they're all agreeing with them.

2405
02:18:01.961 --> 02:18:05.710
And it's,
it's,
it's an unbelievable video to watch because you watch it,

2406
02:18:05.711 --> 02:18:10.000
you realize like,
wow,
there are people like that out there and they're all,

2407
02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:14.570
you know,
they're all praising Allah and in this video and the,

2408
02:18:14.571 --> 02:18:19.450
they're all joining together in this and it's this large group of thousands of

2409
02:18:19.451 --> 02:18:23.450
people.
And there they found themselves.
Sure.

2410
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:24.850
They found people like them.

2411
02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:29.380
They put this video and they took this video and put it online.
And I think the,

2412
02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:32.110
the net,
the title of video is,
it's not radical Islam.

2413
02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:36.160
<v 1>Right?
Sure.
They exist.
The question is what to do about them.
Right.</v>

2414
02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:39.430
So Sam Harris wants to kill them,
you know,
I mean,
he's,
he's an interventionist.

2415
02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:41.380
He wants to think,
he wants to kill them.
Well,

2416
02:18:41.381 --> 02:18:43.840
he certainly has said things that sounded like that.
I mean,
he's,

2417
02:18:43.841 --> 02:18:47.560
he's a big interventionist.
Um,
he,
you know,
he's,

2418
02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:49.810
there's a moment in his book where he,

2419
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:54.370
it looks like he's advocating nuclear assault on people in the Middle East and

2420
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:58.630
he has sort of backed away from that.
Um,
I don't know exactly what was the tens,

2421
02:18:58.631 --> 02:19:03.370
but do you remember the conduct?
Well,
he says that,
you know,
if,
if you have,

2422
02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:03.970
you know,

2423
02:19:03.970 --> 02:19:08.970
x million people who are committed to this fanatical genocidal jihad,

2424
02:19:10.390 --> 02:19:13.000
um,
then the nuclear option might make sense.
I mean,

2425
02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:15.940
you have to read the book for yourself and he has,
he has back,

2426
02:19:15.941 --> 02:19:20.650
he has sort of backed down from that.
Which book was this?
Um,
I can't remember,

2427
02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:21.573
but I can't remember.

2428
02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.140
It's a very sort of infamous quote from him and you know,

2429
02:19:26.170 --> 02:19:28.220
he'd have to speak for himself about what that actually means,

2430
02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:31.130
but not then there's no question that he's an interventionist and military

2431
02:19:31.131 --> 02:19:35.390
intervention.
He wants military intervention against them.
That's,
that's clear.
Um,

2432
02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:38.300
the question is what co,
what,
what would that produce?

2433
02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.570
And my argument is it would produce more of them.
Right,

2434
02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:43.560
<v 2>right,
right.
So,
well,
I,</v>

2435
02:19:43.570 --> 02:19:48.570
I've always been fascinated by the laughs adoption of the term Islamophobia and

2436
02:19:48.791 --> 02:19:52.840
that Islamophobia is one thing that is very,
um,

2437
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:53.860
it's very chic.

2438
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:59.190
It's in style to call someone out on Islamophobia while mocking Christianity at

2439
02:20:00.371 --> 02:20:03.010
the same time.
It's,
it's,
it's an interesting thing,

2440
02:20:03.011 --> 02:20:07.810
like you're allowed to mock Scientology,
you're allowed to mock Mormonism.

2441
02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:12.460
It's a very valid point of debate.
The fact that Mitt Romney was a Mormon,

2442
02:20:12.461 --> 02:20:15.610
he's essentially a cult member.
His family came from Mexico.

2443
02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.530
They fleed to Mexico so that they can have more wives.
I mean this is undeniable,

2444
02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:23.650
right?
And it's,
it's,
it's all fair game and on the table.

2445
02:20:23.651 --> 02:20:27.070
But is Llama phobia is,
is interesting.

2446
02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:29.110
<v 1>Well,
it's just that,
I mean,
I'm not a fan of that,</v>

2447
02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:33.940
but it is that Islamophobia has particular political applications right now,

2448
02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.890
whereas the Mormons are safe in Utah.

2449
02:20:35.891 --> 02:20:40.150
No one's talking about it in here to Utah and killing the Mormons.
Right?
Um,

2450
02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:44.320
yeah.
I mean I look,
if I,
if,

2451
02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:49.350
if they ever came over here and tried to convert Los Angeles and to Sharia

2452
02:20:50.470 --> 02:20:53.650
Sharia regime,
gimme a fucking AK 47 you know,

2453
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.150
and I'll shoot him in the head myself.

2454
02:20:55.600 --> 02:21:00.010
My point is going out there and stopping them from doing it to other people is

2455
02:21:00.011 --> 02:21:01.750
simply going to create more of them and more importantly,

2456
02:21:01.751 --> 02:21:06.280
it's going to actually cause them to wish harm on me to do harm to me.
Right.

2457
02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:09.010
I was in,
I was in New York and nine 11,
you know,
I don't want that to happen.

2458
02:21:09.410 --> 02:21:11.330
<v 2>No,
no doubt about it.
I just,</v>

2459
02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:17.300
I'm looking at it in terms of why is it acceptable to stand up for one religion

2460
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:20.450
and that religion

2461
02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:22.860
<v 1>then used in such bad ways recently.</v>

2462
02:21:23.010 --> 02:21:26.310
That's all it's been used to justify these terrible wars.
Right?

2463
02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:30.840
It was used to justify the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria and the rest of

2464
02:21:30.841 --> 02:21:35.570
it now.
Yeah,
I agree with you.
A tip,
a critical,
it's a double standard.
Um,
um,

2465
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:39.180
yeah.
I have nothing good to say about Islam.
Nothing.

2466
02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:42.690
And I certainly have nothing good to say about that variant of Islam that is

2467
02:21:42.691 --> 02:21:47.680
practiced by the people in Isis or al Qaeda or the Taliban.
Um,

2468
02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:48.660
yeah,
but so what,

2469
02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:49.091
<v 2>right.</v>

2470
02:21:49.091 --> 02:21:52.660
It's like there's all the people all over the world who have ideas that are a

2471
02:21:52.661 --> 02:21:56.050
boring.
To me,
that's such a,
it's such a fascinating debate.

2472
02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:59.110
It's such an interesting take.

2473
02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:02.740
Like which way do you go?
Do you go in,
hey,

2474
02:22:02.741 --> 02:22:06.430
let him be crazy over there or do you say,
listen,

2475
02:22:06.431 --> 02:22:09.220
that crazy over there is going to eventually come over here.

2476
02:22:09.390 --> 02:22:12.790
We've got to figure out a way to plan ahead or we're going to run into a bad

2477
02:22:12.791 --> 02:22:15.700
situation that's going to be out of control.
It's about aggression.

2478
02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:19.510
So it's about who uses aggression,
right?
So if they aggress against me,
hell yeah.

2479
02:22:19.630 --> 02:22:20.320
It's on.

2480
02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.230
And so you feel like these happened aggressed against the few people that have

2481
02:22:24.231 --> 02:22:25.090
been killed over there.

2482
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:28.410
Few reporters that have been snatched up and had their heads cut off on video.

2483
02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:30.570
Like this is such a small amount.

2484
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:35.430
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
hmm.
I mean,
wow.
Not Good.
No,
of course not.</v>

2485
02:22:35.431 --> 02:22:39.350
The Isis argument is that they are an extension of the u s military,
um,

2486
02:22:39.390 --> 02:22:42.480
that that's there and they're an extension of us imperialism,
is what they say.

2487
02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.900
That those reporters,
I'm not in any way justifying what happened to them.

2488
02:22:45.901 --> 02:22:47.930
I think some of them have in British too,
right?
Yeah.

2489
02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:52.710
Well the Brits are an intervening too.
Yeah.
Um,
so you know,
I don't know,

2490
02:22:52.711 --> 02:22:54.360
but I mean,
the point is they are,
as I said,

2491
02:22:54.361 --> 02:22:57.270
they're trying to bait us in which they succeeded,
succeeded in doing.

2492
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:02.160
Look what we're doing today.
We're bombing them right now as we speak.
And what,

2493
02:23:02.161 --> 02:23:04.210
so what will we get from that?
Are we gonna?

2494
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:08.730
Are we gonna kill all 30 or 50,000 of the Isis fighters?
Are we going to do that?

2495
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:13.530
The only way to do that is descend in the entire fucking 82nd airborne and more

2496
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:16.440
and chase them down on the ground and kill every last one of them,

2497
02:23:16.441 --> 02:23:19.950
which I don't even think is possible.
So,
you know,

2498
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:24.000
and what you're doing is you're creating more anti-American hatred in that

2499
02:23:24.001 --> 02:23:28.890
region from which they can recruit
endless war.

2500
02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:29.753
1984.

2501
02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:34.840
<v 2>Fuck.
What's,
what's the way that this can be fixed?</v>

2502
02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:38.200
Get Out,
man.
That's it.
That's the only way.
The Rand Paul Way.

2503
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:42.340
Whereas Hillary Clinton,
hell no.
She wants to chase him to the ends of the earth.

2504
02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:46.960
Sure.
But she's the one who's been in the office.
What did,
he's been there.

2505
02:23:46.990 --> 02:23:48.550
What did Joe Biden to say?
He just said,

2506
02:23:48.551 --> 02:23:51.880
we're going to chase isis to the gates of hell.
Whoa.
And I'm like,
yeah,

2507
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:54.490
that's exactly where you're going to take us.
You're right.

2508
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:57.680
That's what exactly did he really say that?
Yeah,
he did two weeks ago.

2509
02:23:57.790 --> 02:23:59.020
I remember when Joe Biden,

2510
02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.920
we used to do Joe Biden night at a comedy club cause Joe Biden got caught being

2511
02:24:02.921 --> 02:24:05.860
a plagiarist.
Oh yeah.
Do you remember that?
Oh,
you don't know that?

2512
02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:10.360
Interesting Joe Biden,
when he was running for president,
I believe.
Okay.

2513
02:24:10.361 --> 02:24:12.340
I started standup comedy in 1988.

2514
02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:17.590
So it had to be close on people's minds.
So it was somewhere around then.

2515
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:21.460
Joe Biden got in trouble.
He was running for president and uh,

2516
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:25.330
he gave a speech that was a direct rip off of one of Kennedy's speech.

2517
02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:29.890
And uh,
they said,
oh,
you know,
he got speech writers.
He didn't even know.

2518
02:24:29.891 --> 02:24:32.560
But I mean,
they didn't even fucking bother changing the words.

2519
02:24:32.561 --> 02:24:34.690
They just plagiarize the shit out of Kennedy.

2520
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:39.370
And so we used to do Joe Biden night,
it's stitches,
comedy club and a,

2521
02:24:39.371 --> 02:24:40.740
what we do is like a,

2522
02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.260
I would go up and do one of my friends acts and he would go up and do me and we

2523
02:24:44.261 --> 02:24:48.550
would do each others act as a joke and they call the Joe Biden night.
Oh my God.

2524
02:24:48.610 --> 02:24:49.900
So I was,
you know,

2525
02:24:49.901 --> 02:24:53.340
and he never ran for president again after that because of that.
Because of that.

2526
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:55.630
Cause you fucked with them so badly because of that,

2527
02:24:55.660 --> 02:25:00.430
because everyone knew that there was like,
because I remember it.

2528
02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:03.760
I guarantee you other folks that are in the know,

2529
02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:05.440
especially politically in the park,

2530
02:25:05.441 --> 02:25:08.230
they know like that's a big skeleton in his closet.
Like,
look dude,

2531
02:25:08.231 --> 02:25:10.900
you could be vice president.
No one's going to dig too deep.

2532
02:25:11.290 --> 02:25:12.700
But if you ever get to be president though,

2533
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:15.920
why did you plagiarize fucking Kennedy?
Man,
I kind of

2534
02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:20.290
<v 1>Biden in the way in the sense that he's,
he's not very filtered,
right?</v>

2535
02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.220
He doesn't edit much.
His thoughts.
So like what he said about Obama

2536
02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:25.360
<v 3>during the race,
you know,
he was like,</v>

2537
02:25:25.361 --> 02:25:29.500
well people like him cause he's clean and articulate,
you know,
people,

2538
02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:32.720
white people like black guys who were clean and articulate and well spoken and a

2539
02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:36.850
thin.
Yeah.
And then Shims.
Yeah,
they looked,
seems healthy.
Exactly.

2540
02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:42.420
Jogs a lot and stuff.
He's not little Wayne.
Yeah,
he's safe.
He's okay.
Uh,

2541
02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:43.630
I think,
yeah,
I thought he was right.

2542
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:46.630
You know that that was correct and he got into all this shit about it.
Well,

2543
02:25:46.631 --> 02:25:50.200
there's no doubt we like white people that are clean and articulate as well.

2544
02:25:50.201 --> 02:25:53.230
I mean if you,
you've got to Rob Ford guy running for president and he's,

2545
02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:56.380
he's done pretty well in his political career.
You know,
I mean,
Canada,

2546
02:25:56.970 --> 02:26:00.610
Canada is a different animal man.
I guess.
So.
Totally different animal.

2547
02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:05.050
I'm team for it,
man.
I like,
well,
no,
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

2548
02:26:05.051 --> 02:26:09.580
I mean it's just the fact,
you know,
I'm all about individual freedom,
you know,

2549
02:26:09.581 --> 02:26:11.980
and like if you're,
if you're smoking crack,
I don't care.

2550
02:26:11.981 --> 02:26:14.460
As long as you run the city correctly,
you know?
Yeah.

2551
02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:17.800
Why is it okay that he drinks whiskey,
but it's not okay if he smoked.
Exactly.

2552
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:19.600
There you go.
Yeah,
I mean that,

2553
02:26:19.690 --> 02:26:23.890
that's the tremendous North American double standard,
right?
Yeah.

2554
02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:28.270
The double standard of you know about all too well,
yeah.
Come on.

2555
02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:32.190
I mean alcohol compared to weed,
the destructiveness of alcohol.

2556
02:26:32.210 --> 02:26:34.660
Well not only that,
the self awareness aspects of it,

2557
02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:39.580
the blinding you to your actions aspect of alcohol,
which is the whole thing.

2558
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.960
Look,
everyone's talking about being intoxicated in intoxication,
leading to rape.

2559
02:26:43.961 --> 02:26:48.550
No one's talking about stone rape.
Okay.
And it's not a coincidence.
Exactly.
It's,

2560
02:26:48.551 --> 02:26:51.760
it's,
even though marijuana is illegal,

2561
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:56.790
marijuana is something that I believe probably causes less rape than any other

2562
02:26:57.251 --> 02:26:59.390
intoxicant you could ever take.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2563
02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:04.410
It makes you paranoid and self aware and sensitive and you're also more aware of

2564
02:27:04.571 --> 02:27:09.571
other people's feelings and it's probably the least likely to rape drugs ever.

2565
02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:14.140
Of course.
Of course.
It makes you less aggressive.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

2566
02:27:14.141 --> 02:27:16.420
And there's just one of them.

2567
02:27:16.421 --> 02:27:20.650
I mean all of this psychedelics and marijuana is not thought of as a
psychedelic,

2568
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:24.790
but I think it's very much like it is.
Yeah,
they're all illegal.

2569
02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:27.490
Well that's sort of changing too,
you know.
What do you,

2570
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:28.570
how do you feel about that?

2571
02:27:28.571 --> 02:27:32.200
I mean it's an interesting thing seeing the economic aspects of legalization

2572
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.220
state,

2573
02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:38.160
not federal because the states have adopted these new policies in California or

2574
02:27:38.161 --> 02:27:43.030
in Colorado rather and Washington state and now other states are looking at it

2575
02:27:43.031 --> 02:27:46.240
and wondering whether or not they should dive in because of the amount of profit

2576
02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.380
that they're making tax wise.
Yeah.
I,
I money,

2577
02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:55.690
I'm for total decriminalization legalization tomorrow with all drugs period.

2578
02:27:55.750 --> 02:28:00.490
Okay.
So,
um,
but I actually voted against,
was it 17,

2579
02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:05.140
uh,
in California prop 17.
Um,
because if he read it,
it was,

2580
02:28:05.141 --> 02:28:06.370
and a lot of people were sending this,

2581
02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:11.400
it was written by this guy in Oakland who was going to be the new corporate

2582
02:28:11.471 --> 02:28:13.060
chieftain of the weed industry.

2583
02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.830
And it was written in a way that was going to make it very difficult for the mom

2584
02:28:17.831 --> 02:28:22.170
and pops in humble to exist to,
to commercial

2585
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.500
<v 1>to compete.
Yeah.
Cause there's gonna be full of regulations,
right.</v>

2586
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:26.660
It's going to regulate the shit out of it.

2587
02:28:26.661 --> 02:28:30.500
So it was some sneaky shit and most likely,
you know it,
this wasn't stated,

2588
02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:31.640
but what else is going to happen?

2589
02:28:31.641 --> 02:28:35.360
They're going to go to your little farm in Arcata,
California.

2590
02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:37.330
And then I'd be like,
what does that hippie doing there?

2591
02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:41.810
You've got all these guys who were like long haired and they're,

2592
02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:45.730
they're high and they're,
you know,
there's not good workers.
It's,
you know,

2593
02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:49.280
they're going to rig it and say,
I'm sorry,
this is not,
this is not up to snuff.

2594
02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:50.330
We're gonna have to shut you down.

2595
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:54.540
The guy who's going to run the Walmart of weed in the Oak,

2596
02:28:54.570 --> 02:28:57.560
that giant Oakland warehouse he was going to establish in the East Bay up there.

2597
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:59.780
Oh,
he's going to be fine because he's going to be super regulated.

2598
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:01.970
He's going to be very clean.
All those employers are going to be vetted.

2599
02:29:01.971 --> 02:29:05.360
They're not going to be potheads be politically connected to all the right and

2600
02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:07.670
of course politically connected.
So a lot of the,

2601
02:29:07.671 --> 02:29:12.140
a lot of the Humboldt growers were opposed to that proposition for that reason

2602
02:29:12.141 --> 02:29:14.690
cause they saw it forcing them out and giving,

2603
02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:17.480
handing the reins over to the big and,
uh,

2604
02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:21.770
these big corporate entities and pharmaceuticals so that the prediction was,

2605
02:29:21.771 --> 02:29:24.260
and I thought it was right that the big pharmaceutical companies were going to

2606
02:29:24.261 --> 02:29:28.550
move in and take over and make it into a big corporate industry.
And that's,

2607
02:29:28.551 --> 02:29:31.130
I think that's starting to happen in Colorado.
I've seen,

2608
02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.460
I've seen some evidence of that.
In what way?
Um,
it just,

2609
02:29:34.461 --> 02:29:36.470
that there's sort of a monopolization going on.

2610
02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.130
Did the state Reagan state regulation often leads to the creation of monopolies,

2611
02:29:40.131 --> 02:29:43.470
right?
Because it makes it difficult to enter an industry,
right?
If the,

2612
02:29:43.471 --> 02:29:45.980
if it's something,
if an industry is heavily regulated,

2613
02:29:45.981 --> 02:29:49.630
you have to meet all these criteria to enter it as a legitimate licensed

2614
02:29:49.631 --> 02:29:52.640
business,
it becomes more difficult.
Right?
So the existing entity,

2615
02:29:52.641 --> 02:29:54.830
the large corporation that's already there,

2616
02:29:54.970 --> 02:29:59.970
it gets protected by these regulations is called regulatory capture is the

2617
02:30:00.771 --> 02:30:04.380
concept.
Um,
and so I think that's what's gonna happen.
Um,
so I,

2618
02:30:04.381 --> 02:30:08.450
I want no regulation.
None.
Just legal.
Yeah.
Just let us,

2619
02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:11.620
let us grow it and smoke it.
When you say decriminalization,

2620
02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:16.310
do you think that it should be legal to sell things like cocaine and heroin and

2621
02:30:16.311 --> 02:30:19.160
then heroin especially is a tricky one,
right?

2622
02:30:19.161 --> 02:30:23.780
Because people associate that with damaged lives and destruction.
And so the,
the,

2623
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:26.810
the quick one word answer to that is Portugal,
right?

2624
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:30.350
So Portugal decriminalized all that shit.
I mean,
there's some regulations there,

2625
02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:34.460
but they decriminalized all those drugs more than 10 years ago.
Well,

2626
02:30:34.461 --> 02:30:38.060
that is the difference between decriminalization and legalization legalization.

2627
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:40.490
Like if you're selling pottery,
nobody's gonna give you a hard time.

2628
02:30:40.491 --> 02:30:44.240
Like anyone can sell pottery,
but if you get caught with pottery,

2629
02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.230
nobody gives a shit.
But if you get caught with drugs in decriminalized state,

2630
02:30:48.350 --> 02:30:52.230
well then you don't get in trouble.
Right.
But if you're selling it,
yeah.

2631
02:30:52.310 --> 02:30:53.680
It's a different animal.
Yeah.
I want,

2632
02:30:53.681 --> 02:30:57.220
I want the state to have nothing to do with it at all.
So if you,
but anyway,

2633
02:30:57.221 --> 02:30:58.520
so in Portugal,

2634
02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:02.690
great study was done by Greg Glenn Greenwald and the Cato Institute about three

2635
02:31:02.691 --> 02:31:05.480
or four years ago,
looking at the 10 years of decriminalization,

2636
02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:07.010
decriminalization in Portugal.

2637
02:31:07.011 --> 02:31:11.480
And what they found was dreek decreasing the number of HIV cases,
not surprising,

2638
02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:16.160
a decrease in the number of the Dq decreasing the addiction rate,

2639
02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:20.010
which is amazing.
And a decrease in usage.
People actually

2640
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:22.390
<v 2>use it less than amazing.
Yeah.
So there you go.</v>

2641
02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:24.810
People want to do things that are forbidden.

2642
02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:28.590
It's a natural impulse of human beings.
He tried to resist and we tried to do it.

2643
02:31:28.591 --> 02:31:30.600
Creation of a taboo creates a desire.

2644
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:36.090
That's a such a bizarre thing that we have this attachment controlling people's

2645
02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:41.040
access to consciousness enhancing or are or altering substances.
Yeah.

2646
02:31:41.250 --> 02:31:44.280
We're completely committed to this idea and we will,

2647
02:31:44.310 --> 02:31:49.050
we'll pitch it as if it's the only logical explanation or the only logical

2648
02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:51.290
course of business.
Like,
you know,
you're going,

2649
02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:53.640
what are you going to have the streets filled with a bunch of reefer heads?

2650
02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:55.830
Right?
Well,
you look at what's going on in Colorado,

2651
02:31:55.831 --> 02:31:59.360
they have like the lowest rate of drunk driving accidents ever,
right?

2652
02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:02.310
They have a lower rate of murder than they've ever had before.

2653
02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:03.270
They have lower late,

2654
02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:07.290
have lower rates of violent crimes and then they had in a decade,
right?

2655
02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:10.500
Like all these things are happening like right in front of everybody's face,

2656
02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:14.610
undeniable aspects of the legalization of cannabis.

2657
02:32:14.970 --> 02:32:18.720
A drug which makes people more peaceful.
That's right.
I mean it just does.

2658
02:32:18.721 --> 02:32:21.360
It's right.
I mean it doesn't make everybody more peaceful,

2659
02:32:21.361 --> 02:32:24.350
but it's pretty fucking good at it.
Pretty much.
Yeah.

2660
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:28.360
And so if we decriminalized heroin tomorrow,
are you going to start shooting?

2661
02:32:28.361 --> 02:32:31.620
So that's,
but I'm an adult.
The the,
the,
the question is,

2662
02:32:31.650 --> 02:32:36.480
is keeping it from young people just making it more difficult to get,

2663
02:32:36.481 --> 02:32:40.730
is that going to keep one kid from becoming a junkie?
If it is,
is it worth it?
I,

2664
02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:45.930
I don't,
I see that argument,
but I don't think that it jives with human nature.

2665
02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:50.190
And that's why I would say that legalization of all drugs,
it probably be better.

2666
02:32:50.191 --> 02:32:53.730
And also you're creating,
when you create laws,

2667
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.200
when people violate those laws,

2668
02:32:55.201 --> 02:32:58.200
they become criminals and you put him in jail and that's where things get really

2669
02:32:58.201 --> 02:33:02.490
fucked up because then you have what we have in this country,

2670
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:06.330
which we have privatized prisons and then there's not just one.

2671
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:07.650
It's not what we're not talking about one,

2672
02:33:07.651 --> 02:33:09.360
we're talking about many privatized prisons.

2673
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:11.980
So you have a prison industrial complex.

2674
02:33:12.010 --> 02:33:17.010
So along with these laws that has a vested interest in keeping these laws

2675
02:33:17.101 --> 02:33:21.450
active.
So then you have unions,
like you have the prison guards union,

2676
02:33:21.451 --> 02:33:26.451
which lobbies to keep these drugs legal or illegal rather along with

2677
02:33:26.611 --> 02:33:30.690
pharmaceutical drug companies,
which form a partnership for a drug free America.

2678
02:33:30.691 --> 02:33:34.710
And my joke was that's like hookers making commercials against strippers,

2679
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:38.880
like a partnership for a drug free America.
Going out against weed is,

2680
02:33:38.881 --> 02:33:41.950
it's literally like hookers saying strippers are bad,
you know,

2681
02:33:41.951 --> 02:33:46.480
like when they're immoral,
like we're better.
Like it's,

2682
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:51.360
yeah.
Why do kids smoked cigarettes?
A lot of it is because there's a taboo on it,

2683
02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:55.680
right?
Because it's being,
it's being rebellious,
right?
It's also like,
cool,
man.

2684
02:33:56.010 --> 02:34:00.100
It's cool because it's bad.
It's cool because it's bad.
Well,
it's also,

2685
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:05.640
there's a certain romanticism involved to just ruining your life,
you know?

2686
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:09.960
You know what I mean?
Fucking self destruction ranking,
and it's sexy.

2687
02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:12.960
It's the rock star,
self destructive sexiness.

2688
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:19.150
He's fucking gets up at t can't keep a job.
Right?
Blasko you're fired,

2689
02:34:19.151 --> 02:34:22.780
Wilson.
Fuck you guys are rebel.
Get his jacket.

2690
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:26.140
He's going to fucking fucked up leather jackets.

2691
02:34:26.730 --> 02:34:28.910
He gets on his motorcycle in the rain.
You know,

2692
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:31.620
it's like there's drives off a cliff and every,

2693
02:34:31.650 --> 02:34:34.050
and he's in and he's just like international superstar.
Yeah,
yeah.

2694
02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:37.830
I mean in those,
those movies,
those little shitty Arnold Swardson here,

2695
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:41.020
cop movies,
like there's always a scene where he's like,
he's,

2696
02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:42.190
his breakfast is like,

2697
02:34:42.191 --> 02:34:46.420
he pours up fucking couple slices of pizza into a blender and you know what I

2698
02:34:46.421 --> 02:34:47.080
mean?

2699
02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:51.820
It's like there's something about self destruction about people that are

2700
02:34:51.850 --> 02:34:53.350
drinking whiskey first thing in the morning,

2701
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:56.890
that we find them what romantic because we're told all day long to be good and

2702
02:34:56.891 --> 02:35:00.490
healthy and sure,
there you go.
There's a puritan,
is it again?
Right.

2703
02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:03.910
It's actually a rejection of that.
Oh,
it is,
right.
Yeah.
God,

2704
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.420
that is so God damn true.
That's the best way to create sluts.

2705
02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:11.140
I'm not slut shaming by the way.
Um,
when I was a kid,

2706
02:35:11.470 --> 02:35:15.400
we all knew cath every,
exactly.
I didn't even have to say it.

2707
02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:19.120
My first girlfriend was telling me I suck.
Yeah.
I had one too,
which was a freak.

2708
02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:23.860
I say bitch,
with all due respect,
it's a nice book.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.

2709
02:35:23.861 --> 02:35:28.000
I mean this poor girl was so pent up that you would get her alone.
I mean,

2710
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:29.760
I remember I was in the movie theater with her.

2711
02:35:29.770 --> 02:35:32.280
I just grabbed her breast and she started heaving and talk

2712
02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:36.680
like it was like the world was like,

2713
02:35:36.681 --> 02:35:39.280
like Satan was at her door product or,

2714
02:35:39.281 --> 02:35:43.450
and they asked for the people work in her eyes.
He was at her door.

2715
02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:47.830
Isn't it crazy that that is a direct response to suppression?

2716
02:35:48.810 --> 02:35:53.110
This poor girl was so pent up.
The way I described her is like,

2717
02:35:53.450 --> 02:35:57.850
if like she had sex with anybody who asked,
like she was so crazy.

2718
02:35:58.040 --> 02:35:59.200
It was great and she was beautiful.

2719
02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:04.040
But I said that like if you put a dick in front of her,

2720
02:36:04.041 --> 02:36:06.220
it was like rolling a ball of yarn in front of a kitten.

2721
02:36:06.610 --> 02:36:11.410
Like they couldn't help themselves.
Like this is just some,
something about that.

2722
02:36:11.411 --> 02:36:16.030
What they did like surprise,
making it all evil and dark and Catholic school.

2723
02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:19.810
They couldn't wait to just get out of that place and run.

2724
02:36:19.930 --> 02:36:24.700
Just run to freedom.
Sure.
Yeah.
Just schizophrenia culture we live in.

2725
02:36:24.701 --> 02:36:27.370
It's not just Catholics,
right?
It's sort of Americans generally.
I mean,

2726
02:36:27.371 --> 02:36:31.600
we're told both things simultaneously all day long.
Sex is bad.
Watch out,

2727
02:36:31.601 --> 02:36:33.280
be careful and fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck.

2728
02:36:33.281 --> 02:36:36.220
And here's the big chicken a bikini and you're selling cars.

2729
02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.580
Horn is a bigger industry than the automobile industry,
but it's terrible.
Right.

2730
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:44.510
But it's terrific.
Goes on there.
It must be secret.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
Well,

2731
02:36:44.511 --> 02:36:48.020
I remember when it was interesting,
the porn people were asking for a bailout.

2732
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:50.020
It was like sort of a publicity stunt.

2733
02:36:50.380 --> 02:36:54.340
But the reality is that like that industry was crippled.

2734
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:58.600
I mean that industry had its legs taken out by the Internet.
I mean,
there was,

2735
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.290
there was a guy that used to live in my neighborhood who's a porn producer and

2736
02:37:02.291 --> 02:37:05.410
uh,
you know,
he's living high on the hog.

2737
02:37:05.411 --> 02:37:09.810
He had like a fat Mercedes lived in his big ass house and they,

2738
02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:13.990
his house eventually went up.
It was bankrupt.
It went bankrupt and they fucking,

2739
02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:16.130
they sold that bitch.
They took it from him,
closed

2740
02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:20.780
<v 3>on it.
I knew a major porn producer who just died actually recently.
Um,
but he,
um,</v>

2741
02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:23.590
he said they were figuring out ways to monetize it and I,

2742
02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:26.900
I didn't quite understand it,
but the,
the tube channels and all that stuff,

2743
02:37:26.901 --> 02:37:30.440
he said they actually figured out a way to get revenue out of that and I'm not

2744
02:37:30.441 --> 02:37:34.460
sure how,
but anyway,
yeah.
Plugging,
stealing people's credit card numbers.

2745
02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:39.190
I don't know.
Getting videos of you jacking off to it on those little Webcam.

2746
02:37:39.191 --> 02:37:42.230
There you go.
That the FBI's watching.
Yeah.

2747
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:45.950
Let them watch how many they're going to watch a lot since apparently 300

2748
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:46.191
million people.

2749
02:37:46.191 --> 02:37:49.220
How many FBI people he got there keeping an eye on people jerk it off.

2750
02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:52.310
You're going to go blind.

2751
02:37:52.690 --> 02:37:56.750
Fucking people are going to be staring at monitors all day coke bottle glasses

2752
02:37:56.751 --> 02:38:00.070
to go to stumble out of that fucking place into the light of day.

2753
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:04.430
I'd rather work in a coal mine and then have that job.
It's similar effects,

2754
02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:09.450
I'm sure.
Similar effects.
Good Lord.
Yeah.
What a strange culture.
Now you're,

2755
02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:14.360
you're a grown adult with children and a college professor and you're,

2756
02:38:14.361 --> 02:38:18.620
you're faced with all these contradictions in this ridiculous way.

2757
02:38:18.621 --> 02:38:20.990
We're living our life in the society.

2758
02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:24.770
Like how frustrating is it for you to see things so clearly,

2759
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:29.930
but yet see this schizophrenia bizarre society that you're forced to exist in?

2760
02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:34.790
I live in hell.
I mean,
yeah.
I mean,
in a way it's true.

2761
02:38:34.791 --> 02:38:39.790
It's like God,
I don't know.
Yeah,
no,
I'm just angry a lot.
Yeah,

2762
02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.460
seriously.
Yeah.
No,
I'm sort of angry much of the day.
Yeah.
I mean,

2763
02:38:43.461 --> 02:38:45.380
reading the news,
reading people's opinions.

2764
02:38:45.381 --> 02:38:50.120
I'm reading my colleague's work and seeing what they're doing with 19 year old

2765
02:38:50.121 --> 02:38:53.850
girls and even crazier.
It's like,
it's,
it's,

2766
02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:57.440
it's even in college,
it's ridiculous.
I mean,

2767
02:38:57.441 --> 02:39:01.400
it's like humans are fucked,
man.
I'm pissed off.
I,
yeah,

2768
02:39:01.401 --> 02:39:04.560
I've been talking to some friends about this.
It's like,
you know,
um,

2769
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:07.760
Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living.

2770
02:39:07.761 --> 02:39:11.630
And actually I'm beginning to think that it's too painful to live,
you know,

2771
02:39:11.631 --> 02:39:15.710
I just,
Whoa,
you're fucking deep in this.
I'd rather be ignorant sometimes.

2772
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:20.210
Really Start Trinkets on sometimes.
I used to do that and I gave it up.

2773
02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:24.730
Irish Russell partly,
partly enough.
See The freckles Irish enough.

2774
02:39:24.731 --> 02:39:27.770
You've got it in your kid.
Oh yeah,
sure.
Do.
Sure do.

2775
02:39:28.100 --> 02:39:31.960
So you used to drink to try to avoid reality.
Um,
yeah.

2776
02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:36.290
Basically just to mitigate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was like an escape.

2777
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:37.430
It was totally an escape.

2778
02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:42.440
Do you think there's a certain amount of paying attention to the world that may

2779
02:39:42.441 --> 02:39:46.520
perhaps be detrimental to the individual?
Like there's,
there's,
there's a certain,

2780
02:39:46.521 --> 02:39:50.360
there's a certain gauntlet.
The all,
we all have to sort of run to live our lives.

2781
02:39:50.361 --> 02:39:53.390
Regulations that we have to follow as preposterous as they may be.

2782
02:39:53.391 --> 02:39:55.640
But I've often often wondered,

2783
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:59.030
there's like this struggle between trying to think about how much should I just

2784
02:39:59.031 --> 02:40:02.660
concentrate on and enjoying my time here.
And being nice to people,

2785
02:40:02.661 --> 02:40:06.440
doing what I can to just enjoy my time.
There's your ludicrous,

2786
02:40:06.441 --> 02:40:08.340
but there it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2787
02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:13.420
Or completely getting immersed in all the intricacies of the,

2788
02:40:14.481 --> 02:40:18.180
the,
the bullshit.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ.
I don't know.
I mean,

2789
02:40:18.181 --> 02:40:21.060
I've been an intellectual my whole life.
My family is all intellectual.

2790
02:40:21.061 --> 02:40:24.240
It's all we've done is just talk about the world and study the world and talk

2791
02:40:24.241 --> 02:40:27.540
about it and talk about it and get,
and most of it is negative,
right?

2792
02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.170
It's not like,
oh,
it's,
you know,
four of course.
And foreign policy's great,

2793
02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:34.860
you know,
um,
and it's painful and it hurts.
And it's like some of,

2794
02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:37.920
so much of it is literally about life and death and people dying.

2795
02:40:37.921 --> 02:40:42.330
And it's some of that,
some of it.
Um,
man,

2796
02:40:42.450 --> 02:40:43.890
I have a hard time recovering from.

2797
02:40:43.891 --> 02:40:48.110
So the Michael Brown thing was bad enough in Ferguson.
You know,

2798
02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:50.910
I don't know if you saw the video of,
um,
I don't know how you pronounce his name,

2799
02:40:50.911 --> 02:40:54.540
but Kajieme Powell,
who was killed about two days later,
he would choose the kid.

2800
02:40:54.541 --> 02:40:57.660
He was clearly mentally ill.
He walked up to the cops and he said,
shoot me,

2801
02:40:57.661 --> 02:40:58.494
shoot me.

2802
02:40:58.590 --> 02:41:01.710
They said he had a butter knife or something in his hand and there's a video of

2803
02:41:01.711 --> 02:41:02.850
them just shooting him dead.

2804
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:08.760
I cried all night long and I am still,
that was like what,
two months ago?

2805
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:10.410
I'm still bothered by that,
you know,

2806
02:41:10.411 --> 02:41:13.320
and knowing that that's a fairly common thing for a lot of people in this

2807
02:41:13.321 --> 02:41:13.940
society,

2808
02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:17.460
you know that and if you live in a particular neighborhoods that's like a normal

2809
02:41:17.461 --> 02:41:21.420
thing to happen.
Particularly neighborhoods in some ways,

2810
02:41:21.421 --> 02:41:23.750
sort of like a microcosm for the issues of the world.

2811
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:27.480
It's very difficult to overcome momentum and the momentum of a terrible

2812
02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:29.450
neighborhood,
a crime ridden neighborhoods.
Sure.

2813
02:41:29.850 --> 02:41:34.850
Born into poverty and born into the momentum of all these unemployed people on

2814
02:41:35.731 --> 02:41:39.790
welfare.
In that case,
it's being born into a state of occupation.
You know,

2815
02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.790
I think,
I think that there are many of those military state.

2816
02:41:41.791 --> 02:41:44.600
It's basically a military occupation.
It is.
God Damn it.
And you know what,

2817
02:41:44.601 --> 02:41:47.640
and like the military is militarization of the police is only accentuated it,

2818
02:41:47.641 --> 02:41:50.400
but it's been going on for a long time.
That's why black people have it.

2819
02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:53.100
Just a very,
very different view of police than white people do.

2820
02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:55.590
And it's just something white people have to accept and understand.

2821
02:41:55.591 --> 02:41:56.161
And it's hard to,

2822
02:41:56.161 --> 02:42:00.420
if you never go to Compton and never see what it's like and you don't get pulled

2823
02:42:00.421 --> 02:42:03.840
over for simply driving or walking down the street,
you know?
But God damn,
man,

2824
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:07.470
I just,
I,
when I saw that video,
I was like,
okay,
I'm giving up politics.
I'm just,

2825
02:42:07.471 --> 02:42:09.480
I can't do this anymore.
It's too upsetting.
I mean,

2826
02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:13.020
stuff like war and stuff like police violence,

2827
02:42:13.021 --> 02:42:17.160
when I see video of it or hear about it,
it's just,
it devastates me.

2828
02:42:17.220 --> 02:42:17.990
It really does.

2829
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:22.020
And the worst aspects of human beings right in front of you and it's not in your

2830
02:42:22.021 --> 02:42:25.800
life,
your life.
You're going where you going?
You're talking to students,

2831
02:42:25.801 --> 02:42:26.551
you're doing this thing,

2832
02:42:26.551 --> 02:42:30.940
and then you immerse yourself through the internet or whatever the media you're,

2833
02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:35.220
you're getting this vision of the worst parts of humans.

2834
02:42:35.490 --> 02:42:38.490
There's certain things you know and like the idea of locking people up for
drugs.

2835
02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:39.990
Just putting the prisons,

2836
02:42:39.991 --> 02:42:42.450
just putting people in prisons for stuff like that for life.

2837
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:46.350
There's people in prison right now for life.
I can't even,

2838
02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:50.370
I mean the depth of my feelings about that are just unspeakable.
I mean,

2839
02:42:50.371 --> 02:42:52.060
I just want to blow them up.
Yeah.

2840
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:56.010
Now when you talk about not wanting to live though,
do you know,

2841
02:42:56.011 --> 02:42:57.660
not wanting to think,
but you said,

2842
02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:00.450
I'm wanting to know you didn't want to be a part of it.
You like,

2843
02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:05.720
do you mean what you have to know though for what you do for a living?

2844
02:43:05.791 --> 02:43:10.170
Right,
exactly.
That's the problem.
That's the conundrum.
That's exactly right.

2845
02:43:10.470 --> 02:43:11.050
Yeah.

2846
02:43:11.050 --> 02:43:15.850
So sometimes I just want to be like a surfer and just smoke weed.

2847
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:18.520
Why do you do that and surf?
Cause you can't make any money on it.

2848
02:43:18.521 --> 02:43:23.160
And also I'm not,
I mean like 49 like I can't take it,
but I want it.

2849
02:43:23.170 --> 02:43:26.680
Well you couldn't take a surfer,
you body moves while you're moving around.

2850
02:43:26.681 --> 02:43:30.490
Normal issues.
Physical issues?
No,
no,
like actually seriously,

2851
02:43:30.491 --> 02:43:34.530
I want to know,
I want it to be a kickboxer.
Actually I do,

2852
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:39.400
I train well we tie with Joe Schilling
but is committed as a gym.
The yard.

2853
02:43:39.401 --> 02:43:42.530
Yeah.
And everyone should go to the yard.
It's the greatest gym.
Uh,

2854
02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:47.670
I tore my ACL there three months ago,
but until then.
Yeah,
six days a week.

2855
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.760
And how did you tear your ACL?
Tried to do a flying knee and landed funny.

2856
02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:54.820
Oh Man.
I know.
Just hitting pads and stuff.
No,

2857
02:43:54.821 --> 02:43:57.790
I was all by myself with a heavy bag and I just didn't know,
did a flying knee.

2858
02:43:57.791 --> 02:44:00.310
It just stupid.
It was nothing.
I just,
I know landed,

2859
02:44:00.311 --> 02:44:03.010
it's like a lot of ACL is or just that kind of thing.
Right.

2860
02:44:03.011 --> 02:44:06.310
Where you just tour mind taking a bag.
Yeah,
toward both of them.

2861
02:44:06.311 --> 02:44:07.930
That's what it was kicking a fucking heavy bag.

2862
02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:11.530
Well actually got loosened up and guy kicked me in the side.

2863
02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:14.920
I'm bad at checking leg kicks.
Oh.
So he kicked me up.

2864
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:17.680
It loosens like a week before that.
And then this thing,

2865
02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:22.300
I think that's what happened.
But yeah,
no,
I was like,
I wish I could just do this.

2866
02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:25.540
Really?
Oh yes.
That's why I love the new intellectual though.

2867
02:44:25.810 --> 02:44:30.670
Aren't you aware of the negative impact?
You mean the whole brain damage?

2868
02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:34.720
I know,
no,
that's the whole thing.
And it's such a bummer and like I'm just,

2869
02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:40.660
I know.
But you spar.
Yeah.
And if you notice any difference?
Well,

2870
02:44:40.690 --> 02:44:43.270
no,
but I've just been more and more worried about it.
Right.

2871
02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:46.600
It's like I'm just constantly worried about it and that's the problem.
It's,

2872
02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:48.070
and now I don't know what to do.
Like I'm,

2873
02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:51.190
I'm 40 fucking nine and I'm like going in there and they want me to fight.

2874
02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:55.670
They want you to fight.
They've asked me to fight really like an amateur bow.

2875
02:44:55.900 --> 02:44:59.110
Like a smoker too.
So they can get press.
No,

2876
02:44:59.111 --> 02:45:01.450
just cause that's what they do because that's what they train fighters,

2877
02:45:01.490 --> 02:45:05.110
train fire fighters.
Yeah.
It's one of the big Moitai gyms in California.

2878
02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:08.500
So yeah,
so smokers or you know,
there's whatever.

2879
02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:11.440
So you're training and they're like,
listen,
take this to the next place.

2880
02:45:12.610 --> 02:45:15.590
Joe's trainer who owns the gym with Mark Tomorrow,
he said,
hey,

2881
02:45:15.591 --> 02:45:18.760
we should get you a fight.
And I like laughed at him.
I was like,
come on man,

2882
02:45:18.761 --> 02:45:20.440
I'm 40 fucking,
I mean the guys,

2883
02:45:20.441 --> 02:45:24.320
they're all like 25 year old ripped Korean dudes and stuff.
And I um,

2884
02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:28.390
my friend Steve is almost 60 and uh,
he's been my friend,

2885
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.430
he's been my friend since we were,

2886
02:45:30.431 --> 02:45:35.431
I was 15 when I met him and he was an air force flight surgeon and he was doing

2887
02:45:36.821 --> 02:45:39.160
his residency for ophthalmology is just a wild man.

2888
02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:42.100
He's always been doing something and he's a doctor now in Arizona,

2889
02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:46.270
but he's the reason why I became a standup comedian cause he talked me into

2890
02:45:46.271 --> 02:45:48.070
doing it when I was young and I was fighting.

2891
02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:51.940
My point being this guy to this day is ready to take a fight.

2892
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:56.030
16 he's closing,
closing in on 60 he'll take a fight tomorrow.
He's got,

2893
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:57.910
his problem is he was on the u s ski team.

2894
02:45:57.911 --> 02:46:02.911
He's a mad man and he had at least 10 operations on his knees.

2895
02:46:04.690 --> 02:46:09.100
Both of his knees looked like like a fish that you filleted and then stitched

2896
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:10.310
back together again because they had,

2897
02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:14.060
he had his knees done in the 80s when they would take your hamstring,
they were,

2898
02:46:14.061 --> 02:46:17.750
the way they would reconstruct her ACL was they'd use your hamstring so they

2899
02:46:17.751 --> 02:46:20.450
would cut you open like a big line on the side.

2900
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:24.500
Like I'm sure they did yours probably.
Did they do a piece of gum surgery yet?

2901
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:27.470
You haven't?
No.
No,
no.
It's not that bad.
I mean they tell me it's not that bad.

2902
02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:32.240
Yeah.
And he did an MRI when the MRI partial partial.
How much?

2903
02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:35.090
They didn't tell me.
They didn't know.
Why didn't they tell you?
I don't know.

2904
02:46:35.390 --> 02:46:38.840
Where'd you go?
Kaiser.
Okay.
That's no good.
Yeah.

2905
02:46:38.841 --> 02:46:43.430
We'll talk afterwards with a real doctor.
Not,
I'm not a real doctor,

2906
02:46:43.431 --> 02:46:46.100
but I've talked to the dealer or doctor.
Yeah.
That's what I needed.

2907
02:46:46.101 --> 02:46:48.890
And general practitioners are just knocking.
He's an Orthopedist,

2908
02:46:48.891 --> 02:46:53.060
but even an orthopedist who doesn't deal with real athletes is going to say,
oh,

2909
02:46:53.061 --> 02:46:55.490
you're okay.
Just walk around and not going to be fine.

2910
02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:58.310
That means you got a bum knee for the rest of your life that's ready to give
out.

2911
02:46:58.370 --> 02:47:02.810
Not Shit.
Depending upon how much of a partial tear.
Yeah.
I mean,
if it's 10% tear,

2912
02:47:02.811 --> 02:47:06.310
yeah,
let it rehab.
I got no percentage from them.
Yeah.
You need to know.
Okay.

2913
02:47:06.350 --> 02:47:09.950
And you needed a guy who's an expert at reading Mris.

2914
02:47:09.951 --> 02:47:13.370
I've had two different Mris done in my back.
One of them that was shit,

2915
02:47:13.371 --> 02:47:17.120
and one of them that was really clear and it was much different results.

2916
02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:22.670
I'm dying,
man.
I've got to get back in there because as I was saying,

2917
02:47:22.671 --> 02:47:26.300
like when I'm in the gym,
you know,
as you know you,
that's all you think about,

2918
02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:30.290
right.
Everything else goes away.
Isis has gone foreign policy,
history's gone,

2919
02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:33.390
blah,
blah,
blah,
academia.
Fuck,
that Shit's all gone.
I'm just thinking about that,

2920
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:37.380
that fist coming at my face.
Right.
Or even if I'm just working on the bag,

2921
02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:41.390
it's just beautiful and I just,
I wish I just often wish I could just do that.

2922
02:47:41.391 --> 02:47:43.510
Or like I want to move to Thailand and do that thing.
Right.

2923
02:47:43.511 --> 02:47:46.190
Really go to Pooh cat.
Oh my God.

2924
02:47:46.191 --> 02:47:50.870
And just live there on whatever it is and all in mark did that day.
Yeah.
I mean,

2925
02:47:50.871 --> 02:47:53.930
you know,
I know he's a financial advisor and he went to Thailand.

2926
02:47:53.931 --> 02:47:56.990
He lived there for a month and belonged to one of those gyms.

2927
02:47:56.990 --> 02:48:01.520
Changed my last name to fair tax or whatever.
Damn man.

2928
02:48:01.521 --> 02:48:06.380
You got it bad,
Huh?
Well,
your kickboxing for you had this idea.
Well,

2929
02:48:06.381 --> 02:48:09.320
I started with boxing just like bullshit.
Well I took a,

2930
02:48:09.330 --> 02:48:10.760
I took some classes at church,
uh,

2931
02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:13.460
Church street gym in New York when I lived there and then that was like 10 years

2932
02:48:13.461 --> 02:48:17.000
ago and then,
but not seriously.
And then I did like bullshit cardio kick.

2933
02:48:17.930 --> 02:48:21.200
Then I joined the yard about two years ago and then I just got really into it.

2934
02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:22.850
I want to start when I start at the yard.

2935
02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.170
It was like that's all I wanted to do and it's all I was thinking about,
dude.

2936
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:31.190
So I am the only phd history professor in this country.

2937
02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:35.710
I am sure who has listened to you call 500 fights.
Wow.
Yeah.
No,

2938
02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:38.570
I've watched like probably a majority of the UFC fights.

2939
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:42.990
I've watched every single glory fight of watch k one.
Yeah,
that's it.

2940
02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.970
I got obsessed with it about two years ago.
Sucks it,
it gives you praying damage.

2941
02:48:47.410 --> 02:48:51.220
It doesn't,
it doesn't,
it.
We need to fix this.
Listen man,
when I,

2942
02:48:51.310 --> 02:48:54.830
it's one of the main reasons that I got in.
Do you feel like comedy,

2943
02:48:54.890 --> 02:48:58.730
do you feel like you got any Oh yeah,
I've definitely pretty late.
Yeah.
I mean,

2944
02:48:58.731 --> 02:49:00.220
I don't know.
I mean I talk,
okay.

2945
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:03.500
I was going to say your brain is doing pretty well for a guy who didn't graduate

2946
02:49:03.501 --> 02:49:08.220
college.
I mean,
I am fairly articulate.
Um,
but I definitely

2947
02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:10.270
<v 2>been hit in the head a lot.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

2948
02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:14.340
but it was all done by the time I was in my early twenties.
Okay.
I stopped,

2949
02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:18.360
but I was worried I'd get headaches.
I'd lay in bed after sparring,

2950
02:49:18.361 --> 02:49:21.170
I get headaches,
but I was sparring with some murders.

2951
02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:25.950
I've only done kind of moderate sparrings and I haven't really gotten hit hard

2952
02:49:26.010 --> 02:49:28.980
while I was fighting two.
I've fought.
Yeah,
that's a different story a lot.

2953
02:49:28.981 --> 02:49:32.440
It's like window tournament's in three kickboxing bouts,
but the,
um,

2954
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:35.400
the sparring is the more dangerous thing.
I know.

2955
02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:38.520
Because you'd get concussed and then guys would dust you off and push it right

2956
02:49:38.521 --> 02:49:39.450
back in there.
Right.

2957
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:43.650
Especially back then when I was doing it was the late eighties that nobody knew

2958
02:49:43.651 --> 02:49:46.980
what the fuck is going on with the brain.
There was no real studies done.

2959
02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:48.690
They knew when people were punched drunk,

2960
02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:53.400
but they didn't really have a good grasp on traumatic brain injury.
Right.

2961
02:49:53.730 --> 02:49:58.110
I have a good friend who's a doctor and his specialty is traumatic brain injury

2962
02:49:58.111 --> 02:50:02.580
and he has enlightened me in a way that's absolutely terrifying.
He's like,

2963
02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:07.370
you know,
you could go waterboarding,
you know,
like not water boarding,

2964
02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:10.620
jet skiing,
curb like a,

2965
02:50:10.621 --> 02:50:13.530
what is it when they pull you behind a boat and you're fucking bouncing around?

2966
02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:15.660
Water skiing,
water skiing.
Yeah.
He's like,

2967
02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:19.680
guys get brain damage from water skiing.
He's like,
no doubt about it.
She's like,

2968
02:50:19.681 --> 02:50:24.510
the pituitary gland is very sensitive and it's when it gets jostled around and

2969
02:50:24.511 --> 02:50:26.730
banged up depending upon the individual look,

2970
02:50:26.731 --> 02:50:28.530
there's people that box and they're fine.

2971
02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:31.830
And then there's people that they get hit a few times and then they have all

2972
02:50:31.831 --> 02:50:36.720
sorts of depression issues.
Their body stops producing hormones properly.
See,

2973
02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:39.660
I dunno,
man.
Traumatic brain injury is no fucking joke.

2974
02:50:39.661 --> 02:50:44.661
And I have had the unfortunate experience of knowing people pre and post.

2975
02:50:45.390 --> 02:50:47.460
I are good friends.
I'm sure you did it.

2976
02:50:47.461 --> 02:50:52.461
I knew that that when they started out they were fine and now they're not fun.

2977
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:54.503
Yeah.
Can I,

2978
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:57.840
this is a question I can't believe I got this opportunity to ask Joe Rogan this.

2979
02:50:57.841 --> 02:51:02.340
Do you,
are there UFC fighters or former UFC fighters that you're sure have it

2980
02:51:02.430 --> 02:51:05.340
unquestioned?
Okay.
Without a doubt.
Yeah.
No doubt about it.

2981
02:51:05.341 --> 02:51:09.390
Like many without a doubt.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you stay in there long enough,

2982
02:51:09.391 --> 02:51:13.290
it gets you like you can see it and some of them.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Absolutely.

2983
02:51:13.370 --> 02:51:16.770
It's in the same thing.
I can think of a couple who are leading suspects.

2984
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:20.430
I would be a real piece of shit if I denied it.
It's uh,

2985
02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:24.120
I mean there's a lot of people,
I'm sure they would like me to not comment on it,

2986
02:51:24.121 --> 02:51:28.860
but it's one of my only issues with,
I don't mind broken bones.

2987
02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:33.420
Like I see like when Anderson silver broke his leg,
it was nasty,
but I got to,
oh,

2988
02:51:33.421 --> 02:51:36.900
that's nothing.
Yeah,
I'll trade that for bringing injury any day.

2989
02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:40.560
I was way more concerned when he got knocked unconscious course when he got

2990
02:51:40.561 --> 02:51:43.530
knocked out.
And then when he came back just a few months later,

2991
02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:47.070
I was the one guy that was saying he's not going to be the same.

2992
02:51:47.310 --> 02:51:49.650
Like you gotta be aware like that is,

2993
02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:53.280
that's a guy that got knocked unconscious for months ago.

2994
02:51:53.281 --> 02:51:57.750
He's not going to be the same.
He's in training already.
He's sparring already.

2995
02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:00.480
He's not gonna be the same guy six months later.
He's just not,

2996
02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:04.200
there's no way around it.
It's one of the beautiful things that,
that um,

2997
02:52:04.201 --> 02:52:06.320
Manny Pacquiao was Treanor um,

2998
02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:10.690
Freddy Roach has got trauma related Parkinson's himself.

2999
02:52:11.170 --> 02:52:14.230
So when he got knocked out by Marquez,
Freddie Roach was like,

3000
02:52:14.231 --> 02:52:17.770
you're not fighting for a year.
Like you just need to recover.
I'm like,

3001
02:52:18.210 --> 02:52:20.470
just get that in your head now.
You want to keep going.

3002
02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:22.510
You're not fighting for a year.
It's such a bummer.

3003
02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:26.590
It's a unit and unboxings the worst.
Clearly.
I don't know about that man.

3004
02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:30.160
I used to say the established,
I used to think that too,

3005
02:52:30.161 --> 02:52:33.640
but the reality is it's all about the training and in training,

3006
02:52:33.700 --> 02:52:35.860
MMA fighters are getting hit in the head a lot.
I mean,

3007
02:52:35.861 --> 02:52:40.450
you're not getting hit in the head as much unless you're a guy who only wants to

3008
02:52:40.451 --> 02:52:41.284
stand up.

3009
02:52:41.410 --> 02:52:45.730
And then you're also dealing with kicks and kicks are a different animal.

3010
02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:48.490
You can kick so much harder you up,

3011
02:52:48.570 --> 02:52:50.250
then you can punch getting kicked in the head.

3012
02:52:50.251 --> 02:52:55.010
You can probably kick 10 times harder than American punch course.
You know,

3013
02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:58.470
I can send a heavybag flying across the room with a kitchen.

3014
02:52:58.750 --> 02:53:02.230
And if you imagine what that can do to your fucking head,
it's terrible.

3015
02:53:02.231 --> 02:53:06.160
I've seen guys get hit in the head in kickboxing matches and they're never the

3016
02:53:06.161 --> 02:53:10.390
same again.
Oh,
I've seen it.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
So that's,

3017
02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:15.070
that's something to think about.
Go to the ground.
Yeah.
Learned some Jujitsu.

3018
02:53:15.410 --> 02:53:18.790
Danieli Bolelli my good friend.
I love that dude mutual friend.
Yeah,
I love that.

3019
02:53:18.970 --> 02:53:21.120
We're probably going to start,
that's the move.

3020
02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:25.210
That's the intellectual pursuit because it's,
first of all,
it's far more complex.

3021
02:53:25.211 --> 02:53:29.920
Realize far less on athleticism.
And you can do it deep into your old age,
right?

3022
02:53:30.140 --> 02:53:33.190
You know,
Helio Gracie was doing it and it's fucking eighties you know,

3023
02:53:33.191 --> 02:53:37.020
it's chess.
Yeah.
And as long as you do it with good partners,
you can,
you can,

3024
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:40.780
you can really go at it and be aware that the guy's not going to hurt you.

3025
02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:44.230
You know,
things happen accidentally.
Needs get twisted and you know,

3026
02:53:44.231 --> 02:53:48.200
you fall funny,
but no head injury,
no manager,
very rarely you know me.

3027
02:53:48.270 --> 02:53:51.810
You can collide heads occasionally,
but it's not the goal,
you know,

3028
02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:55.090
and getting choked unconscious really has no repercussions.
No big deal.

3029
02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:58.210
You just go,
you wake up and you can actually guys do it all the time.

3030
02:53:58.211 --> 02:54:01.140
They get choked out and they go back to rolling like moments later.
Right.

3031
02:54:01.310 --> 02:54:04.600
Get you involved.
I'll get you in there.
I'm going to get you a good doctor too.

3032
02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:08.290
All right,
good.
Thank you very much for doing this man.
It was a lot of fun.

3033
02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:12.310
We really,
really enjoyed it.
It was just three hours,
just blue box.
That's it.

3034
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:15.900
And A,
your book renegade history of the United States.
Uh,

3035
02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:19.390
it's available right now.
You can get it on Amazon.
Is it an audio book as well?

3036
02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:23.800
Audio of you reading it?
Nope.
It's a Shakespearian actor.

3037
02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:28.150
Why did they do that?
Did they,
did they resist you reading it?
You'd be perfect.

3038
02:54:28.151 --> 02:54:32.680
It's hilarious.
He does like black,
like slave dialect in a Shakespearian sonnet.

3039
02:54:32.890 --> 02:54:36.880
The Shakespearian read it,
but it's still good.
You're still buy it.
I,
yes.

3040
02:54:36.881 --> 02:54:40.480
Everyone by it.
By that and by the book and uh,
fattiest Russell,

3041
02:54:40.481 --> 02:54:42.190
you could find them on Twitter.
And what is your website?

3042
02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:45.180
Thaddeus russell.com that's it.
Thank you sir.
Appreciate it.

3043
02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:46.300
Thank you very enjoyable.

3044
02:54:49.350 --> 02:54:50.850
And I have to Piss so bad,
like.
